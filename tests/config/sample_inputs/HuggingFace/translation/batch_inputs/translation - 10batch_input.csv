"In a 911 call, his voice only slightly shaky, college professor Shannon Lamb told police he had shot his girlfriend and officers needed to get over to their house."
"Lamb made a point to say his ""sweet dog"" was there alive and probably upset, and said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on her phone."
"Inside the home, officers found Amy Prentiss' body and a hand-written note scribbled on a white legal pad: ""I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me,"" read the letter authorities say was signed by Lamb."
"There was no indication that Lamb, who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school's campus, where police believe he shot and killed a well-liked history professor, Ethan Schmidt, in the doorway to his office."
"Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10:18 a.m."
"He said Lamb made the fateful 911 call sometime after that."
"By the end of the day, there would be one more death: Lamb took his own life as police closed in on him."
"A day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lamb."
"The details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher."
"Students said they looked forward to his class."
