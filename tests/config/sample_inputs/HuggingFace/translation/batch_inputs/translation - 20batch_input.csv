"Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the ""wonderful people"" he shared his academic life with."
"Both taught in the Division of Social Sciences and History, which lists 17 faculty members, and many students took courses from both."
"At the same time, there were some inclinations of problems."
"A student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and jittery, ""like there was something wrong with him."""
"Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year."
"Lamb had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence, saying he had a health issue of some sort."
"This year, he was only teaching two online classes."
"Recent changes in the university's hiring policies meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic tenure track to become an assistant professor."
"University President William LaForge said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but ""obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind."""
