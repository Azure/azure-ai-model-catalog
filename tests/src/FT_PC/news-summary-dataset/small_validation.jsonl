Gattuso, who played 73 times for his country and lifted the World Cup in 2006, is currently unattached after spells in charge of FC Sion, Palermo and OFI Crete. He made his name as a tough tackling midfielder at Rangers before he returned to Italy with Salernitana in 1998. Gattuso, who also applied for the Hamilton Academical job in January, would go on to make more than 300 appearances for AC Milan during a 13-year stint at the San Siro. Oldham remain without a manager after Lee Johnson jumped ship to join League One rivals Barnsley in February. Gattuso enjoyed hugely-successful 13-year spell with Milan, where he won two Champions League titles . Johnson is set to face a hostile reception when he returns to Boundary Park with his new club on Saturday. Oldham spoke to Paul Scholes about the likelihood of taking over from Johnson but the Manchester United legend, who lives in the town, decided that the timing was not right. Others to be linked with the job include ex-West Bromwich Albion manager Alan Irvine, former Manchester City coaches Scott Sellars and Steve Eyre and Iain Dowie, who managed the club from 2002 to 2003.","highlights":"Gennaro Gattuso wants to be next boss of League One Oldham Athletic .\nHe has had spells in charge of FC Sion, Palermo and OFI Crete .\nThe 37-year-old also applied for Hamilton Academical job in January ."}
{"article":"Two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson believes he can freewheel at Augusta this year because all the pressure will be heaped on Rory McIlroy as he goes for the career grand slam. Watson failed miserably the last time he was in the limelight as defending champion, only just making the halfway cut at Augusta in 2013. But the big-hitting American is convinced he can live up to his status as one of the favourites this time because all the attention next month will be focussed on the Northern Irishman. Reigning Masters champions prepares for Augusta by playing at the WGC Cadillac Championships in Doral . Watson insists that Rory McIlroy will be under more pressure than himself at the Masters . The world No 1 only needs an Masters crown to complete a full set of grand slams . \u2018There\u2019s no pressure on me because I have two green jackets already, but it will be different for Rory,\u2019 he said. \u2018To be going for the career grand slam and at such a young age as well, if that was me in his shoes I would consider myself under a lot of pressure because who would not want to complete that? I think the key for Rory will be to try to look at it from an achievement standpoint rather than a pressure situation \u2013 that he\u2019s there because of the amazing feat of winning three of the four majors at aged 25. 'He can also think to himself that if it doesn\u2019t work out this year, then at least he is going to have plenty more tries in years to come.\u2019 Like McIlroy, Watson will complete his pre-Masters tournament preparations at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, which begins at Bay Hill in Orlando on Thursday. And the gifted leftie was full of praise for the world number one, predicting he will break many golfing records in years to come.

{"article":"John Guidetti has seemingly distanced himself from a longer stay at Celtic by telling Dutch media he wants to return to Feyenoord 'perhaps as soon as possible'. The Swede scored 20 goals when on loan in Rotterdam in the 2011-12 season and remains hugely popular with Feyenoord fans. Guidetti, who made the comment in an interview with RTV Rijnmond, will become a free agent at the end of the season when his loan at Parkhead from Manchester City expires. John\u00a0Guidetti has scored twice in his last four appearances, raising his tally to 13 overall for the Hoops . The 22-year-old striker placed talks about a permanent deal in Glasgow on hold in January as he endured a long scoreless run. Guidetti has since scored twice in his last four appearances - raising his tally to 13 overall - but it remains to be seen whether Celtic will put forward a lucrative contract offer to try to persuade him to stay. French giants Marseille and Southampton have also been linked with interest in the striker. Meanwhile, Ronny Deila claims he wants Craig Gordon to stay with Celtic for the remainder of his career. The Parkhead boss has already spoken with chief executive Peter Lawwell about the possibility of a new contract for the keeper, who signed a two-year deal when he joined the club last summer. Gordon's excellent performances since then have been key to Celtic's progress under Deila and brought the 32-year-old firmly back into contention to be Scotland's No1. Guidetti (left) goes down under pressure from\u00a0Danilo D'Ambrosio during Celtic's clash against Inter Milan . According to reports in England, they have also attracted the attention of Chelsea, who have apparently included his name on a list of candidates to be back-up to Thibaut Courtois next season. Deila, though, is keen for the former \u00a39million man to remain in his squad for as long as possible. 'He's a great goalkeeper and a man we want to keep at the club,' insisted the Norwegian. 'We will do everything to keep him here. I understand why other clubs are looking at him because he's had a fantastic season. Myself and Peter have already talked about this. It's also about what Craig wants and hopefully he wants to stay here and be with Celtic.' Gordon's acquisition on a free transfer was one of the best bargains of recent time in Scottish football. Asked what value he would now place on the ex-Hearts and Sunderland man, Deila replied: 'I can't sell him. I don't want to. I want him here for the rest of his career.' Celtic boss Ronny Deila wants Craig Gordon (above) to remain at Parkhead for the remainder of his career . On the prospect of Gordon signing up for life on the Chelsea bench after coming through two years of injury anguish and rekindling his career at Celtic, Deila said: 'It would be a shame but I don't think he wants to do that \u2013 he wants to play football until the end of his career. 'It's a rumour and we will see what's in it. There will be clubs interested if he wants to go, but we want to keep him. 'He's performed great and without him we wouldn't have gone through the group stage (in the Europa League).' Gordon will again form Celtic's last line of defence as they seek to open up a nine-point Premiership lead with victory over St Johnstone on Wednesday night. Emilio Izaguirre and Kris Commons are, however, sidelined with knocks.","highlights":"John Guidetti\u00a0scored 20 goals when on loan with\u00a0Feyenoord in 2012 .\nGuidetti is currently on loan at Celtic from Manchester City .\nThe Swede will become a free agent at the end of the season when his loan at Parkhead expires .\nGuidetti has scored twice in his last four appearances, raising his tally to 13 overall for the Hoops ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Eight American aid workers who were exposed to Ebola in Sierra Leone have been flown back to the United States where health authorities will watch them closely for signs of the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Three more exposed workers are due to arrive back in the United States on Monday. The returning workers are clinicians for Partners in Health, a Boston-based aid group. None of them is showing symptoms of Ebola, but all had contact with a colleague who's been diagnosed with the disease and is being treated at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. While in West Africa, the workers \"came to the aid of their ailing colleague,\" according to a Partners in Health statement. As the CDC investigates who else might have had contact with the Ebola patient, more workers might be flown back to the United States, according to Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the CDC. The workers are being housed near hospitals that specialize in treating Ebola patients, and if they show signs of the disease, they'll be admitted as patients. Nurse who contracted Ebola sues hospital company . Four of the clinicians arrived Saturday to housing on the campus of the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, according to spokesman Taylor Wilson. The workers have voluntarily agreed not to leave their housing. \"They will be monitored so they'll stay there,\" Wilson said. Another aid worker was flown to Atlanta over the weekend and is being housed near Emory University Hospital, and three more workers are scheduled to arrive in Atlanta on Monday, according to Nancy Nydam, spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Public Health. As in Nebraska, the workers in Georgia must stay in their housing for 21 days after the date of their exposure to Ebola. \"Twice a day, we'll have visual monitoring either face to face or we'll Skype with them, or do FaceTime,\" Nydam said. \"And if it's Skype or FaceTIme, they'll have to be in a place where we can clearly identify that they are where they're supposed to be.\" Three more exposed workers arrived Saturday at the National Institute of Health in Maryland. These workers \"will remain restricted from public places\" and have \"limited movement, including no mass transportation,\" according to a statement from Christopher Garrett, a spokesman for the Maryland Department of Health. The heath care worker with Ebola was in serious condition Friday, the NIH said. Details about the patient's identity weren't released. The patient is the second with Ebola admitted to the NIH hospital. Nina Pham, a nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, was admitted to NIH in October after she contracted the disease while treating Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan. Pham recovered and was released free of disease. Duncan died. Emory, the NIH and Nebraska are three of only four hospitals in the United States that have biocontainment units to deal with a highly infectious disease such as Ebola. More than 10,000 people have died in a West African epidemic of Ebola that dates back to December 2013, according to the World Health Organization. Almost all of the deaths have been in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Ebola is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. CNN's Carma Hassan, Joe Sutton and Eliott C.

{"article":"Hong Kong (CNN)The search is on for China's teen top guns. China said Monday it has selected 16 high schools to offer pilot training as the country's armed forces seek to attract better qualified recruits. The schools, in 11 provinces across the country, will recruit 1,000 male junior high school students aged between 14 to 16, the China Daily reported. Successful applicants will receive flight training and \"military standard\" physical training in addition to their regular high-school studies. It's the latest attempt by the People's Liberation Army's air force to attract more talent. Last year, it said it would require wannabe pilots to take psychological assessments and a flight simulation test. China's military has traditionally been focused on winning land battles and is now making efforts to improve its air and naval power in the pursuit of what President Xi Jinping has called \"balanced strength.\" \"China has made many strides in the development of advanced aircraft, but it must make sure there can be sufficient, well-trained pilots to fly them,\" Wang Ya'nan, deputy editor-in-chief of Aerospace Knowledge magazine told The China Daily last month. The recruits will receive a stipend and board at the schools. Traditionally, serving in the military has not been a sought-after career in China and a U.S. report on China's military transformation released last month singled out the quality and professionalism of new recruits as a major challenge. Many are still drawn from rural areas with limited education, while country's one-child policy, which has created the \"little emperor\" phenomenon of spoiled children, produces recruits who \"may not be tough enough to withstand military discipline,\" the report added. To this end, China has been making efforts to recruit more high school and college graduates as it modernizes its armed forces. On completing the three-year program, students will take a pilot selection test, and those who pass will join a PLA flight academy and those who fail can choose to enter other military universities or civilian institutes.","highlights":"China wants 1,000 male junior high school students for pilot training .\nThe country seeks to strengthen its navy and air force ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Blame it on Beyonce. Ever since the superstar songstress released her surprise self-titled album in December 2013, it seems like dropping music with little to no fanfare has become a thing. The latest artist to do so is rapper Kendrick Lamar, whose eagerly awaited sophomore album was set for release March 23. Instead, \"To Pimp a Butterfly\" was made available on iTunes and Spotify early Monday. Lamar, who has been hailed as the savior of hip-hop, got a major shout-out from fellow artist Taylor Swift. Among the other artists who've surprised fans: . Drake . The rapper thrilled fans in February when he snuck out \"If You're Reading This, It's Too Late.\" Like Beyonce, he clued fans in via an Instagram post. The 17-track project was billed as a mixtape. The rapper also released a short film titled \"Jungle.\" U2 . The shock in the band's album \"Songs of Innocence\" was not only that it was released but that iTunes subscribers had no choice but to get it. Apple made the album part of an automatic download in October as part of the iPhone 6 announcement. U2 frontman Bono later apologized, and Apple distributed info to customers on how they could delete the album after some complained that the automatic download was invasive. David Bowie . In 2013, the legendary rocker unexpectedly released \"The Next Day.\" It was his first new project in a decade, and fans were thrilled, as the famously private Bowie had been off the grid for a while. Wolfmother . The Australian trio received much less attention than some others when they dropped \"New Crown\" in March 2014 with no promotion or marketing. Kid Cudi . The rapper's \"Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon\" arrived online in March 2014 and led Billboard to ask, \"Is the Beyonce approach working for other 'surprise' albums?\" \"I wonder when this is done frequently, does the surprise factor wane?\" one executive told Billboard. \"If there are a lot of releases promoted this way, it will become less impactful. If mid-level and lower-level artists pile in, will the surprise get applied to the point where the public doesn't care anymore?\"","highlights":"Lamar's new album was expected out March 23 but was released Monday instead .\nArtists like Drake, David Bowie have released surprise albums ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Thomas Muller might be a World Cup winner with Germany but at home he has a different title: managing director of carrots. That's because his wife, Lisa, is an aspiring dressage rider with her own designs on conquering the sport she loves. And the hours they spend at stables just outside Munich seem to be paying dividends, Lisa picking up her first title at national level over the weekend. While the 25-year-old hones her craft in the world of prancing horses, Thomas takes a keen interest in breeding, as well as reveling in the solitude of an environment that is a stratosphere away from the pressurized spotlight he is used to. \"I come here to watch if everything's fine,\" he told CNN in the couple's first joint television interview. \"And for the carrots. I'm the managing director of carrots! I watch the dogs. Sometimes I help a little bit but it's her business. \"I enjoy it a lot. They make me feel comfortable, the attitude and what they look like and [the way they] live their lives. It's fun. It's easy to relax around horses.\" At 25, Muller is as decorated in the world of soccer as they come. He has a glut of domestic trophies, including three German Bundesliga titles, and claimed the European Champions League and FIFA Club World Cup crowns with Bayern Munich in 2013. Last year in Brazil he landed the ultimate prize when Germany powered its way to a first World Cup triumph since 1990, memorably beating hosts Brazil 7-1 in the semis before edging past Argentina in the final. But you won't hear much talk of that landmark moment in Muller's career around the stables. \"He's interested in horses so when we are together we talk about horses and not really about football,\" Lisa explained. \"He knows more about horses than I know about football.\" While Muller has enjoyed overwhelming success at an early stage in his career, Lisa's path is a more arduous and exhaustive one. Though she has been riding horses since her Granddad introduced her to the sport aged four, it takes time to build a strong bond with a horse in dressage. And though her recent victory at the Grand Prix in the Bavarian town of Kreuth shows she is clearly in tune with her horse Birkhofs Dave, Lisa says her learning curve is a lengthy one. \"You have to do eight years to learn everything but then you still don't know everything. You always keep learning,\" she said. \"It's not like other sports, you always train yourself, you have to get a harmony between the horse and yourself. \"It has its own mind, its own feelings. You have to become a team and that's why it takes so much time. Every horse is different so you have to feel it. \"I want to get better and better. Maybe at some point I will be very good, that's my dream. [The Olympics] would be a dream. \"I think for every sportsman it's a dream and you want to reach it but just a few people can reach it. Maybe, maybe not.\" According to Lisa's coach, G\u00f6tz Brinkmann, that is a distinct possibility. Last year's qualification for the prestigious Piaff-F\u00f6rderpreis -- a national series for riders aged 25 or below -- underlined her potential. \"I've never had a student that developed that fast no matter what horses they had,\" Brinkmann told CNN. \"She's got the will and she's got the talent and she doesn't stop. She keeps on working. And not so many riders have the ability and that makes her fortunate in a way. \"I think she'll be able to be successful on an international level for sure.\" Muller is of the same opinion. Though he is forbidden from riding himself -- to prevent sustaining an injuries that might impact on his football career -- he has taken a keen interest in the relationship between his wife and Birkhofs Dave. Both the couple's disciplines rely on a high skill level, but also strong communication, and though the competition is fierce, Muller has high hopes for the pair. \"The potential is there,\" he said. \"He's our best talent I think and the number one in our stable and for Lisa. \"But it's no guarantee for success because in Germany there's a lot of opponents. A lot of good riders and a lot of good other horses. Like in football. \"She has no pressure. I want that she's happy with the horses, with the work and with the competitions. But it's not easy. \"It's very tough to get up in Germany in the dressage sport. She needs time to develop her quality. We're on a good way and we need to go for it.\" Muller can also see parallels in the way some horses with potential develop into thoroughbreds, whether in racing or dressage circles, while some fall by the wayside. \"There are some talents and they grow up and go to the top,\" he said. \"And some talents don't get to the top. \"It's interesting to watch, the development of the different horses from when they come to the stable and when they leave. But he [Birkhofs Dave] stays for sure.\" Muller has his own sideline at the stables too -- breeding. \"Breeding is a little bit for fun,\" he explained. \"For sure I want to breed the best horse I can. But it's difficult and a bit of luck. But I try my best to optimize. \"My dream is one day that Lisa rides a horse that I bred. But that's a long way to go.\" Though she often goes to watch Thomas play at Bayern Munich's home stadium -- the Allianz Arena -- Lisa doesn't even remotely fit the WAG stereotype. The wives and girlfriends of high-profile footballers are often portrayed as carefully manicured, fashion-obsessed shopaholics -- an image cultivated by the tabloid newspapers. But Lisa, who chose not to travel with Thomas to the World Cup in Brazil last year, has not one scrap of jealousy when it comes to the superstar treatment her famous husband gets. \"I don't,\" she said. \"You have the bad sides also. Everyone comes and wants to get a photo, a selfie or an autograph. That would be too much. I can't do that like Thomas can do it. \"He's so easy going. And I want to do my horses by myself. I can groom them the best, I can ride them the best and I love them the most. \"They're my partner, my brother. I can tell them every problem. They're the most important part in my life.\" This statement provoked a laugh from her husband: \"I have already accepted it,\" he joked. \"Maybe I'm number five. But it's OK.\"","highlights":"Wife of Bayern Munich Germany star Thomas Muller is an aspiring dressage rider .\nLisa Muller recently won her first title at national level on board Birkhofs Dave .\nThe 25-year-old trains at stables just outside Munich where she has eight horses .\nThomas has host of titles with Bayern and won the World Cup with Germany in 2014 ."}

A statement on the website announced the news of his death at home Thursday with \"immeasurable sadness.\" \"I was deeply saddened to learn that Sir Terry Pratchett has died. The world has lost one of its brightest, sharpest minds,\" said Larry Finlay, managing director at Transworld Publishers. \"In over 70 books, Terry enriched the planet like few before him. As all who read him know, 'Discworld' was his vehicle to satirize this world: He did so brilliantly, with great skill, enormous humor and constant invention.\" Pratchett continued to write following his diagnosis, completing his last book, a new Discworld novel, in the summer of 2014. Revealing his illness in 2007, the author -- who had a strong following among fans of fantasy fiction -- said he had been diagnosed with \"a very rare form of early onset Alzheimer's,\" which he described as \"an embuggerance.\" He said then, \"Frankly, I would prefer it if people kept things cheerful, because I think there's time for at least a few more books yet.\" According to Thursday's statement, he had posterior cortical atrophy, a progressive degenerative condition involving the loss and dysfunction of brain cells, particularly at the back of the brain. The last posts on his verified Twitter account, run by Pratchett with close friend Rob Wilkins, give a poignant farewell -- and have already been retweeted thousands of times. \"AT LAST, SIR TERRY, WE MUST WALK TOGETHER,\" the first tweet in the series reads -- an apparent reference to Death, a recurring and generally sympathetic character in the Discworld books, who always speaks in ALL CAPS. \"Terry took Death's arm and followed him through the doors and on to the black desert under the endless night. \"The End.\" Jeremy Hughes, chief executive of the Alzheimer's Society, a charitable organization, said Pratchett -- who spoke out publicly about his condition and called for greater funding for Alzheimer's research -- had \"fundamentally changed the way dementia is seen and understood.\" \"His vehement determination to reduce the stigma of dementia meant he helped drag it out of the shadows -- kicking and screaming at times,\" he said. \"Shouting from the rooftops about the absurdity of how little funding dementia research receives, and fighting for good quality dementia care, he was and will remain the truest of champions for people with the condition.\" Pratchett was also a patron of the British Humanist Association, which paid tribute Thursday to the humor and dedication with which the author \"turned his suffering into a positive campaign.\" Pratchett, who began writing while a provincial newspaper journalist in the 1960s, became a full time writer in 1987 and received the Order of the British Empire \"for services to literature\" from Prince Charles in 1998.

{"article":"(CNN)Hillary Clinton's lawyerly news conference Tuesday, at which she doggedly parried suggestions that her use of a private email server to conduct official State Department business was improper, might extinguish the matter for most Americans -- but it doesn't get Clinton out of the woods politically. The real possibility of lasting political damage to the former secretary of state will come if her emails reveal any favoritism to any of the foreign donors who contributed to the welter of powerful charitable organizations housed at the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. This is the multibillion-dollar foundation Hillary Clinton leads alongside ex-President Bill Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea. What we already know about the foundation's donors is controversial: Some of the corporations, banks and foreign governments that have funded foundation projects have abysmal human rights records and have been involved in everything from drug money laundering to aiding terrorism in violation of American law. The Clintons can make a plausible case that it's best to solicit money from companies and foreign governments -- even ethically challenged ones -- and put it to good use attacking problems of global poverty. As Bill Clinton recently told reporters: \"You've got to decide when you do this work whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country.\" It's an interesting and important debate, and most Americans would probably approve the idea of putting \"bad\" money to good use.  But the argument only works if Clinton's work as secretary of state was completely separate from the foundation's tip-toeing around ethical challenges. To figure that out requires analyzing the history of what began as the William J. Clinton Foundation shortly after he left office in 2001.  Different initiatives were added over the years to combat AIDS, climate change, poverty and other ills; the most high-profile of these projects, the Clinton Global Initiative, added in 2005, brings world leaders together to tackle the world's problems. To make things even more complicated, the foundation's website says its mission is supported by the Clinton Presidential Center in Arkansas, which includes an archive of the President's papers. The foundation recently co-sponsored a Black History month event with the center. The foundation's thicket of relationships with corporate donors and foreign heads of states is difficult for outsiders to penetrate and understand. And with 350 employees spread across 180 nations, running the foundation is an expensive proposition: in 2012, the various initiatives spent $214 million according to The New York Times but still ended up $8 million in the red. Who gave, and why, is hard to figure out. According to The Wall Street Journal, \"The Clinton Foundation does disclose its donors, which isn't required by law. But the disclosure is limited; dates and exact amount of the donations aren't disclosed. Donations are listed in value ranges and updated annually with only the previous year's donor getting an asterisk by his or her name.\" Hillary and Bill Clinton have put some safeguards in place to put distance between her job as secretary of state and the inner workings of the foundation. During Hillary Clinton's years as secretary of state, the high-profile Clinton Global Initiative split off from the larger Clinton Foundation, and Bill Clinton says he had no direct involvement in its day-to-day operations. Hillary Clinton also stayed away from the foundation during her time at the State Department and agreed to subject possible conflicts to the department's ethics office. It was only after she resigned that she formally joined the foundation and added her name to its title. Ideally that would settle the matter, but there's the possibility that the elaborate formal safeguards may have been breached or ignored. An investigation by The Wall Street Journal found that \"at least 60 companies that lobbied the State Department during her tenure donated a total of more than $26 million to the Clinton Foundation,\" raising questions about whether the firms were using the donations to curry favor with the secretary of state. In one well-publicized case, Hillary pressed a state-owed Russian airline to buy American planes from Boeing. The effort worked: Boeing ended up with a $3.7 billion contract. (To be sure, secretaries of state are always lobbying foreign countries to purchase American products. It's part of their job.) But weeks after Clinton's persuasion (what she called a \"shameless pitch\"), Boeing donated $900,000 to the foundation. A CNN investigation by Alexandra Jaffe recently showed that half a dozen banks that gave money to the Clinton Foundation were involved in ethically questionable behavior and might have used donations to the foundation and\/or its CGI spinoff as a way to gain favor with the Clintons and enhance their tarnished reputations. In 2012, the British bank Standard Chartered paid $667 million in fines for violating sanctions against Iran and HSBC paid $1.92 billion to settle claims of illegally doing business for customers in Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Myanmar and allowing drug dealers to launder money through the bank. Both banks have been major contributors to the foundation. As Jaffe notes, \"the fact that the foundation partnered with banks that were actively under investigation raises questions over what restrictions, if any, the foundation placed on its fundraising operation.\" And according to The Washington Post, seven nations donated millions to the foundation during Clinton's time as secretary of state, including a $500,000 gift from Algeria that the foundation failed to clear in advance through the State Department's ethics office. That sort of corner-cutting, and the cozy-seeming connections between Clinton and various corporations and governments, will be tough to explain on the campaign trail. If emails suggest Clinton was aware of the corporations, banks and nations sending money to her foundation during her time at the State Department -- or worse, took action to help encourage the flow of donations -- the issue would almost certainly derail her likely presidential campaign. It's much too early to count Hillary out, of course. The Clintons can credibly argue that the money they collected has funded more than a billion dollars' worth of good works, from lowering the price of HIV-fighting drugs in developing countries to advancing green technology and educating girls and women. But there's no scenario in which voters can be expected to ignore or support the former secretary of state if she is shown to have been simultaneously arranging pay-to-play deals with businesses and governments seeking help or favors from the U.S. government while she was in office. What will matter is not why or how Hillary stored her emails but whether the actual emails show her in ethical quicksand from which no presidential candidate can escape.","highlights":"Errol Louis: Bigger question than kind of email used is whether Hillary Clinton's emails show favoritism for donors .\nHe says some corporations and foreign nation donors stained by sanctions for illegal behavior .\nLouis: If voters see a quid pro quo from the former secretary of state's emails, it could derail her candidacy ."}

{"article":"Moscow (CNN)The primary suspect jailed in connection with the shooting death of Boris Nemtsov withdrew his confession Wednesday, saying he had been under duress during his admission and isn't guilty. Zaur Dadayev told two members of Russia's human rights council that he pleaded guilty after being detained because he was scared. He told Eva Merkacheva and Andrey Babushkin he had been tortured and the well-being of his family and friends were threatened. Dadayev was one of two suspects recently charged in the case. Three other suspects have not been charged. Merkacheva and Babushkin were accused of \"interfering\" with the investigation and will be summoned for questioning over their motives, authorities said. Russia's Investigative Committee stated that the two rights activists violated the law when they visited and questioned Dadayev in a Moscow jail. Amnesty International condemned the Russian officials' decision to go after the activists, saying that a \"threat to bring criminal charges\" against the rights activists \"raises alarming questions over the fairness of the investigation.\" Anton Tsvetkov, the head of the Public Chamber's commission for public security, said Dadyev and two other suspects denied being involved in the shooting of the Russian opposition leader. He said a doctor found no signs of torture during an examination of the three men. Shagit Gubashev and Anzor Gubashev had no bruises or wounds despite the fact they allege they were beaten by police, Tsvetkov said. Dadayev did have a cracked tooth and handcuff marks on his wrists. Nemtsov, one of President Vladimir Putin's most outspoken critics, was shot in the back on a Moscow bridge as he walked with his girlfriend near the Kremlin in February 27. The three suspects visited by Tsvetkov deny they are guilty and have appealed their arrests, he said. Putin has condemned Nemtsov's killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate, the Kremlin has said. He also wrote to Nemtsov's mother, saying he shared her grief, and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice.

{"article":"Norman, Oklahoma (CNN)Trinidad James isn't mad at Beauton Gilbow. The rapper's hit song can be heard playing in the background as Gilbow, the house mother of the University of Oklahoma Sigma Alpha Epsilon house -- known as Mom B. -- repeats the n-word seven times on camera. It appears overboard considering that the hook of the song, \"All Gold Everything,\" uses the word only three times per succession. Gilbow has been bombarded with claims that she's just as racist as the fraternity members caught singing a racist song on a bus last weekend. It's an allegation she's firmly denied, and the Atlanta rapper who wrote \"All Gold Everything\" is willing to give her a pass, though he wouldn't condone her use of the word. He doesn't hate her, though. \"I'm not going to be that person,\" he told CNN. \"It's a rock and a hard place. I can't be as upset at that lady. I'm upset at the fraternity because what they're saying is a chant that's just completely disrespectful to the black race. As far as that lady goes -- man, that's an old lady, man. Let that lady be.\" The Trinidad-born rapper, whose real name is Nicholas Williams, said he doesn't like giving interviews about race and the n-word because his views are complex and hip-hop stars can be hypocrites when it comes to the topics. \"It's hard to ridicule somebody for something that you continue to use in your music,\" he said. \"Every (hip-hop) artist is using the n-word in their music -- hit records with the n-word in it. You can't be upset when somebody says it. You can't. It's hard to differentiate when you can use it. If we don't want the word used and the word holds such a negative connotation, then we shouldn't use it at all, period.\" He compared it to children hearing their parents curse, \"and they told you not to curse. You wanted to curse. You cursed.\" Context matters, he said. If you're using the word in a negative way, talking down to someone or being sarcastic, that's wrong. \"But if it's somebody that you've been rocking with or we're listening to music or whatever, I can't be upset,\" he said. \"It's humanly impossible for you to be upset at a different race saying it when you're saying it in your music. That's crazy to me.\" He has a different take on the fraternity members caught clapping, pumping their fists and chanting, \"There will never be a ni**** SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me.\" SAE no stranger to scandal . \"I don't respect that at all. What kind of world are we living in here?\" he asked. He took it personally, he said, because he and other hip-hop artists travel the country to perform for fraternities, and to know any fraternity member would harbor such vile feelings toward him \"burns my heart.\" As fellow Atlanta rapper Waka Flocka Flame noted when he canceled an upcoming show for the University of Oklahoma SAEs, Trinidad James said people of all races attend his concerts and have a great time together. \"These fraternities are places that us as hip-hop artists, we come and do amazing shows for these fraternities, like I just did Texas Tech, I just did Texas A&M, Delta Chi, Sigma Chi, and those guys were great. And I've done a show actually at Oklahoma last year,\" he said. \"So to see that that chapter feels that type of way toward the black race, it hurts, man. It sucks.\" He even takes a special pride in performing in front of these audiences, he said. \"We go really hard for these college kids. I didn't go to college, so for me, I feel really good when I can make kids who are doing the right thing and going to college ... have a good time because college is so strenuous on the mind and it's so hard when you've got to pay tuition and books, trying to survive as a young adult, so that's why we try to come and make sure the kids have a great time. If you go look at the shows, it's an amazing time.\" As far as the chances that he'd ever perform in front of Oklahoma's SAE chapter in the future, forget about it, he said. He doesn't care if they were resurrected as an all-black fraternity, he said. \"I don't want nothing to do with that because that's ridiculous. I feel like anything they do now is just to cover it up and make it look better,\" he said. And while it's disturbing to see young people voicing racist leanings, Trinidad James said he'd prefer to know where someone stands over being misled. Fraternities considering booking him in the future can keep that in mind, he said. \"I would rather you didn't even book me for the shows. I'm not no hired monkey,\" he said. \"Just don't be cool with me. Don't talk to me. If you feel that way about me that you would want to hang me from a tree then don't talk to me. I would stay away from you because obviously my skin color offends your life.\" CNN's Nick Valencia conducted the interview from Norman, Oklahoma, and Eliott C. McLaughlin wrote from Atlanta.","highlights":"Trinidad James says it would be hypocritical to condemn Beauton Gilbow .\nThe University of Oklahoma SAE house mom was caught on tape saying n-word .\nRapper: If \"you would want to hang me from a tree, then don't talk to me\""}
{"article":"(CNN)We have no problem taking Wall Street executives to task for decisions that leave American families financially devastated, yet we give Silicon Valley billionaires a pass when they do the same thing. America needs to realize that instead of creating jobs, Silicon Valley is erasing them, leaving millennials financially stranded before their careers can get off the ground. Silicon Valley is tossing millennials aside like yesterday's laptop. The commonly held belief is that with hard work and a good education, a young person in America can get a good job. But despite falling unemployment, college grads age 22 to 27 are stuck in low-paying jobs that don't even require a college degree. The percentage of young people languishing in low-skill, low-paying jobs is 44%, a 20-year high. Only 36% of college grads have jobs that pay at least $45,000, a sharp decline from the 1990s, after adjusting for inflation. Perhaps most depressingly, the percentage of young people making below $25,000 has topped 20%, worse than in 1990. In other words, those with a bachelor's diploma were better off before the digital revolution. If this comes as a surprise, that's because images from popular culture push the idea that young college graduates are shrugging off bad employment prospects with their do-it-yourself attitude. In our collective imagination, millennials are saying, \"No jobs? That's OK \u2014 I'll create my own!\" And then they solve their own problems by heading to Silicon Valley with little more than an iPhone and an idea to create the next hip app that supposedly will turn them into overnight millionaires. A fictional example of this new breed of young idealistic entrepreneur would be Mike Bean, founder of Internet behemoth Gryzzl on the show \"Parks and Recreation.\" Played by Blake Anderson, Bean might best be described as \"barefoot and pregnant with ideas.\" The bumbling entrepreneur conquers the world practically by accident, armed only with his digital savvy, a can-do spirit, and a penchant for invading users' privacy. You get the idea that his success came easily. Privacy concerns aside, the Mike Beans of America are just about as rare as the Mark Zuckerbergs. In fact, the percentage of people under 30 who own private businesses has reached a 24-year low. Garages across the country are not exactly humming with millennials launching tech startups. But wait \u2014 won't the digital economy eventually lead to better jobs? After a period of adjustment, won't things get better? Unfortunately that's not the path we're on. One of the biggest misconceptions about the digital economy is that for every middle-class job rendered obsolete by technology, there's a new, equally good (or better) job created by Silicon Valley. But exactly the opposite is happening. The digital economy is vaporizing the good jobs and replacing them with two kinds of jobs: minimum wage jobs (think Amazon warehouse employees) and so-called \"sharing-economy jobs\" (think Uber drivers). The sharing-economy jobs are even worse than minimum wage jobs because they offer no stability or protections for workers. Sharing economy jobs aren't really jobs at all; they're freelance gigs. Sure, Silicon Valley doesn't owe America jobs. But something is wrong with the picture of a handful of tech billionaires overseeing a kingdom of falling wages, decreased worker protection and zero job security. This \"winner-take-all\" digital economy is not sustainable. People on both sides of the political spectrum are worried. Liberal luminary Robert Reich, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley and former secretary of labor under Bill Clinton, calls the sharing economy the \"share-the-scraps\" economy. Speaking of tech companies that utilize on-demand labor, such as Uber, Instacart and Taskrabbit, he says, \"The big money goes to the corporations that own the software. The scraps go to the on-demand workers.\" Meanwhile, conservative columnist Ross Douthat fears a dystopian future in which \"a rich, technologically proficient society will no longer offer meaningful occupation to many people of ordinary talents.\" Put simply, Silicon Valley's utopia is the rest of America's dystopia. And those who are punished more than anyone else are recent college graduates, whose lifetime earning potential has already suffered an irreversible setback. And if you think your own job is safe, think again. New research predicts that nearly half of all jobs are susceptible to automation over the next two decades. This is a giant leap backward, but it's deceptively described as technological \"progress.\" As anyone who's talked to an automated system on the phone lately can attest, \"automated\" usually means \"worse.\" What can be done? How can we fight this slide back toward the Middle Ages? If we take no action, we're headed toward a kind of digital world feudalism where there are a handful of kings, a lot of peasants and no middle class. There's no easy fix, but we can do three things immediately. First, we can stop glorifying tech titans and start talking openly about Silicon Valley's questionable tactics and its real job creation record (i.e., just follow the numbers). Second, we can encourage more lawsuits against the abusive practices of \"sharing-economy\" powerhouses. Third, we can elect leaders who are vocal about holding Silicon Valley accountable for their power over the entire American workforce, including white-collar employees. The fictional Gryzzl's tagline borrows some millennial slang: \"Wouldn't it be tight if everyone was chill to each other?\" Indeed it would. And if we want a better future for millennials and the generations after them, we need to challenge the prevailing Silicon Valley ethos before it's too late.","highlights":"David Wheeler: Silicon Valley doesn't create jobs; it's wiping out middle-class jobs .\nYoung college graduates are struggling with lack of jobs, yet many still idolize Silicon Valley ."}
{"article":"(CNN)The American Civil Liberties Union is challenging an Alabama law that will force those under 18 seeking an abortion to go through an adversarial process that's akin to a trial. Generally, laws in the United States require parental consent for a minor to obtain an abortion. But for some children, parental consent is impossible or even dangerous. This class of minors must seek a judicial bypass. While the bypass is a common feature of abortion laws in other states, this Alabama law may have gone too far. Here are the suspect provisions of this \"bypass by trial\": . \u2022 Alabama has turned what is supposed to be an informal, child-centered hearing into more of a trial. \u2022 The court can appoint a Guardian ad Litem -- normally an appointed lawyer for a child in, say, a divorce proceeding or a hearing involving unfit parents -- for the fetus. \u2022 The minor may be cross-examined by the district attorney and possibly the minor's parents. \u2022 Information about the minor's pregnancy may be disclosed to her family, friends and employers, and they might even be brought to court to testify -- against the minor. When it comes to abortion, minors are supposed to enjoy the same constitutional right of privacy as adults, free from undue state interference. However, the Supreme Court has also specifically articulated reasons why the constitutional rights of children are not identical to the rights of adults. Children are vulnerable and unable to make critical decisions and, of course, parents have a right to participate in raising their child. States may pass laws that subject minors seeking an abortion to an additional requirement: parental involvement. However, if the state chooses to require parental consent for a pregnant minor to get an abortion, the state also must provide an alternative procedure for obtaining that authorization -- one that \"bypasses\" having to get Mom and Dad's permission. The Supreme Court has required that these hearings \"must assure that resolution ... be completed with anonymity and sufficient expedition to provide an effective opportunity for an abortion to be obtained.\" Plus, and perhaps most importantly, the procedure bypassing parental consent cannot be a thinly veiled mechanism for an \"absolute, and possibly arbitrary, veto.\" In plain language, hearings must be quick and quiet, and they cannot be held in kangaroo court. The problem is, this does not give a lot of detailed direction to courts about how exactly to conduct these hearings. It's not surprising that court procedures vary wildly, and that sooner or later, a state like Alabama would experiment with state abortion law. Our system was specifically designed to allow states to experiment with social and economic legislation. Of course, that state prerogative is also tempered by a federal court's power to strike these laws down if they are unconstitutional. In this case, the ACLU's position is that creating an adversarial hearing goes too far. A hearing is fine, it seems, but something approaching a trial rises to the level of an impermissible \"undue burden\" on the right to have an abortion. This has been defined by the courts as placing a substantial obstacle in the path of the adult, or minor child seeking the abortion. The federal court that reviews these state statutes will be charged with determining whether Alabama's law violates established Supreme Court bypass requirements. But what about the actual bypass requirements themselves? They are a creation of the Supreme Court. Striking down an act of a state legislature is one thing -- challenging settled Supreme Court precedent is entirely another. What if the constitutional standards for bypass procedures contain something of an intrinsic paradox? Consider how it applies in this case. In Alabama, a judge at one of these hearings is required to waive the parental consent requirement if the judge finds either: . (1) that the minor is mature and well-informed enough to make the abortion decision on her own; or . (2) that performance of the abortion would be in the best interest of the minor. Abstract concepts like \"mature\" and \"best interest\" are rather amorphous at best. (True story: A respected law professor advised many classes of students that when confronted on the bar exam with a question about a child, do the following: Write \"best interest of the child\" somewhere in the first sentence; then write \"whatever the heck you want\" for the rest of the answer.) So then, the court must determine whether the minor is mature -- mature enough that she may have the court's permission to have an abortion. This means the court can then arrive at this Kafkaesque, perplexing alternative: A particular minor is too immature to have an abortion -- with the result being that this immature minor ... should therefore be ... a parent of an infant?  It gets stranger: What about a finding that it is in the best interest of the young mother to have the baby, even though she is deemed too immature to have an abortion? How would it be in the best interest of the immature mother to have a child? State courts and legislatures are not completely to blame; after all, the law of minors and juveniles is always going to be about some difficult but arbitrary line-drawing.  Whether we're considering the drinking age, the driving age or the voting age, we've learned over the centuries that kids mature at different ages. Plus there is no easy legal formula to address the myriad situations of messed-up families. Unfortunately, legislatures must draw some lines -- lines that will not always be workable in every situation. And there are surely situations where the bypass might actually be effective: for example, a very young pregnant minor with completely absent parents, who needs court intervention. The problem is, if it creates an undue burden in one situation, then it's constitutionally suspect. But ultimately, building up the procedural hurdles for a pregnant minor almost by definition encroaches upon the limits set some time ago by the Supreme Court.  It's a procedure that needs to be defined; teen pregnancy certainly isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Neither are lousy families, unfortunately. Whether the boundary lines of judicial bypass ebb toward the autonomy of minors, or back toward the state interest in the fetus, the broader social \"findings\" of judicial bypass proceedings will always remain the same: It's all very sad.","highlights":"Cevallos: Alabama may go too far in the process used to decide if a teenager can have an abortion without parental consent .\nHe says a court hearing makes sense, but an adversarial process, like a trial, is questionable ."}

{"article":"An own goal and late strike from Dominic Solanke booked Chelsea a place in the semi-finals of the UEFA Youth League as Atletico Madrid were swept aside at the club\u2019s Cobham training base. John Terry stayed behind after training to watch on the sideline as the teenagers showed Chelsea\u2019s first team how to progress in Europe ahead of their Champions League last-16 second leg match at home to PSG on Wednesday.

Subs:\u00a0Perez, Rodriguez, Montoro,  Spoljaric, Prieto, Altamirano, Gama . Goals: Nil . After a tight opening half, the Blues finally broke the resistance of their Spanish opponents after 38 minutes when defender Fran Manzanara could only guide Izzy Brown\u2019s effort into the net. They then mounted a Jose Mourinho-esque rearguard action to keep their opponents at bay through the second period before Solanke struck on the counter-attack to settle it two minutes from time. Atletico had eliminated Arsenal in the previous round and arrived in sunny Surrey seeking to pile the misery on another English opponent. Viveash was taking no chances, fielding a full-strength team containing Brown and Solanke, both tipped by Mourinho for bright futures, the talented Frenchman Jeremie Boga and England under-19 star Charlie Colkett. Charlie Colkett (left) finds himself shielding the ball from\u00a0Saeid Ezatolahi Afagh . After a quiet start in which both teams tested one another out, Chelsea had the first chance on 25 minutes when Boga sent a free-kick spiralling over Carlos Marin\u2019s crossbar. Just when it appeared the opening 45 would end without score, Brown broke free down the left channel and outpaced the Atletico defence. Colkett found him with the ideal through ball and Brown directed it past the goalkeeper. With Andreas Christensen charging in to make sure, the under-pressure Manzanara got an unfortunate final touch to help it in. Brown will certainly want to claim the goal, his third goal of this season\u2019s European campaign. Atletico were much improved after the break, dictating the tempo and starting the create opening. Amath Diedhiou, who scored the last 16 winner against Arsenal, fired in a near post effort that Bradley Collins diverted around the post. Victor Mendiondo (left) wins a header for the Spanish side, while Dominic Solanke rose highest (right) Shortly afterwards, Matija Spoljaric sent a bouncing shot narrowly wide as Chelsea\u2019s goal came under threat. But their defence refused to be breached and, in classic Chelsea style, they grabbed a second on the break in the dying moments. Christensen, playing in midfield rather than his normal defensive position, showed his creative instincts with a fine pass to Solanke and the England under 18 international applied the finish. Remarkably, it is his ninth goal in the Youth League this season. Chelsea are the first to book their place in the semi-finals, which take place across the road from UEFA\u2019s headquarters in Nyon on April 10.

{"article":"(CNN)The misuse of outer protective garments may have led to the exposure of a potentially deadly strain of bacteria at the Tulane National Primate Research Center near New Orleans, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. An employee at the center has tested positive for the bacterium, which is kept at the facility. The employee is not sick, and Jason McDonald, a CDC spokesman, said the bacteria probably aren't a threat to the general population. Inspectors from the CDC and the U.S. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said the misuse of outer garments \"could have led to the bacteria clinging to inner garments and getting carried out of the select agent lab where research was being conducted with the bacteria on mice,\" a news release said. \"Additionally, CDC and APHIS inspectors determined that Tulane primate center staff frequently entered the select agent lab without appropriate protective clothing, which would increase the risk of bringing the bacteria out of the lab or becoming infected themselves.\" The bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, was being tested on mice in a biosafety level 3 lab at the Covington, Louisiana campus. It can cause can cause melioidosis, also known as Whitmore's disease. All research with the agent at the facility was suspended on February 11 and will remain suspended until it can be shown that there are no more risks and that proper procedures are being followed, the CDC said. The CDC says the primate facility can resume that research when Tulane officials show inspectors that: . \u2022 Entity-wide procedures exist to ensure animals accidentally exposed in the future are managed appropriately; . \u2022 All personal protective equipment procedures are thoroughly reviewed and revised appropriately to lessen the risk of future breaches; . \u2022 All Tulane primate center personnel are trained on any new or revised protective clothing procedures; and . \u2022 Improved entry and exit procedures to the outside enclosures housing non-human primates are in place to stop any further transmission among the animals.\" The CDC and U.S. Department of Agriculture say they have completed their investigation, which began in November when two monkeys were diagnosed with Whitmore's disease. Six others had antibodies indicating exposure to the bacterium. According to the CDC, \"the bacteria causing melioidosis are found in contaminated water and soil. It is spread to humans and animals through direct contact with the contaminated source.\" It is not transmitted between humans or animals, \"and the risk of acquiring melioidosis is low,\" the CDC said. Melioidosis \"is predominately a disease of tropical climates, especially in Southeast Asia and northern Australia where it is widespread,\" according to the CDC website.","highlights":"The error \"could have led to the bacteria clinging to inner garments and getting carried out\" of a lab, inspectors say .\nAlso, \"staff frequently entered the select agent lab without appropriate protective clothing\"\nThe CDC says the bacteria probably aren't a threat to the general population ."}

The free range squirrel is white in texture and is said to have a similar taste to rabbit while being low in fat.

The unusual delicacy became so popular with customers it sold out in three hours . James Holliday, forestry and conservation manager at the estate, said: 'Rabbits are no longer breeding 'like rabbits'. 'Nationally, numbers have been in decline over the past few years and have now reached such low numbers we are limiting the number killed in order to maintain a sustainable population. 'The population had been decreasing since the 1950s and it has become increasingly important for us to conserve as many rabbits as possible. 'We have been catching the squirrels for a while now but obviously the reduction of rabbits made us think we could use them as a substitute and it has done very well.' The meat is being used in a variety of recipes by the estates customers, including a squirrel pasty (pictured) Richard Howard, food shop manager at the estate, said squirrel meat could be a healthy addition to diets.

{"article":"Washington (CNN)The State Department is reviewing Hillary Clinton's emails to determine what can be released to the public, not whether she did anything wrong, according to a senior department official. Clinton aides and department officials stressed this week that the former secretary of state did not violate State policy when she exclusively used a private email account for government work. However, it is currently unclear whether Clinton broke a State guideline dating back to 2005 that suggested \"normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an (authorized information system), which has the proper level of security control.\" Those guidelines were filled with exemptions that could allow Clinton to use a private account. The department official was careful to say that the people reviewing the documents are \"not going to prejudge the outcome of the review of Secretary Clinton's 55,000 pages of emails.\" Clinton was not automatically in violation of State Department policy when she exclusively used a private email during her four years as America's top diplomat, the source added, contradicting other media on Thursday. \"Under federal regulations, there is no prohibition on using a personal email for official business as long as any records are preserved,\" the official said. \"Reports claiming that by using personal email she is automatically in violation of that FAM [Foreign Affairs manual] are inaccurate.\" Clinton's use of private email was never hidden from anyone, according to a former State Department official. The former secretary of state sent thousands of employees message from that account and in her four plus years at the State Department, nobody raised a red flag and say that she couldn't conduct her email communication in the manner she was conducting it, the former official adds. There were no big internal discussion among State Department lawyers, either, about Clinton's use of private email. The former official said it was simply accepted as her form of communication. Clinton's exclusive use of a private email system has quickly ballooned this week into a controversy for the presumed Democratic frontrunner for president in 2016. Experts have said it doesn't appear Clinton violated federal laws, but that hasn't stemmed the issue that has become more about bad optics and politics. Clinton tweeted on Wednesday night that she asked State to release her emails. \"I want the public to see my email,\" her tweet said. \"They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.\" The State Department acknowledged Clinton's request after the tweet, and a senior official said the review could \"take several months.\" And while State officials said their review will focus on what can be released, the inquiry will also have to determine what is not suitable for dissemination given its sensitivity. If the department has to withhold documents, questions are likely to be raised about whether Clinton broke State Department guidance for transmuting sensitive but unclassified materials. On Friday, Marie Harf, a state department spokeswoman, said she was \"not going to speculate\" about whether there is sensitive information in Clinton's emails. \"We just don't know what would happen in that situation, there are so many variables and factors, I just really don't want to speculate,\" Harf said. The New York Times reported on Thursday that Clinton's closest aides at State were well aware that Clinton communicated using a private email address. \"Neither career foreign service officers nor State Department lawyers suggested that Mrs. Clinton use a department email address,\" the Times reported, citing a person with direct knowledge of the inner workings of State Department under Mrs. Clinton. Clinton's spokesman failed to comment to CNN questions about those revelations by the Times. A senior State Department official did say on Friday that administration officials who engaged in email exchanges with her would been party to the fact she used a private account, although it is unclear how many administration officials she actually emailed. Several Clinton former senior staffers have said they used to get their instructions from her verbally. The questions around Clinton's email use have captivated political watchers over the last week and allowed Republicans to cast Clinton in a similar way they did her husband, former President Bill Clinton: As a secretive politician pushing the boundaries and rules and regulations. Charges of hypocrisy have also surfaced given that an inspector general's report from 2012 - while Clinton was secretary - repeatedly cited Ambassador to Kenya Scott Gration's use of \"commercial email for official government business\" saying it was against policy to do so \"except in emergencies,\" which created morale problems, \"confusion and discouragement within the embassy community.\" Gration, who resigned his post in 2012 before the IG report became public, was criticized for a number of other things in the document, but it was clear that his using commercial email instead of State Department email was a real concern. At the time, Clinton was using her own personal email account to conduct official business. Clinton set up a server at her home in New York to keep her emails, meaning she and her aides were in possession of the documents, not the State Department. When the representatives from State asked for all her records in 2014, Clinton sent them the 55,000 pages of emails. A Clinton aide said they provided \"anything that pertained to her work\" at State, but it is impossible to verify the former secretary of state did send everything. State Department guidelines require employees who use private email accounts to back up those documents on government computers so that the department can archive them and they can be available for Freedom of Information Act requests. Clinton aides argue that they complied with State rules when they sent the documents to the department, but that did not happen until 2014, over a year after Clinton left the department. In addition to directives from State, federal guidelines from Clinton's four years leading the department do not appear to outlaw the exclusive use of personal email devices. The National Archives and Records Administration, the government agency that regulates the Federal Records Act, issued guidance in 2009 -- the same year Clinton took over at State -- that allowed agency employees to use personal accounts as long as they ensured \"that federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system.\" Before that, the archives agency said they did not \"specifically address this issue.\" It wasn't until 2014 - when President Barack Obama signed an update to the Federal Records Law - that a timeline was set up to mandate how quickly emails had to be turned over by people who used personal devices. David Chalian, Jim Acosta, Brianna Keilar and Chris Frates contributed to this report.","highlights":"Clinton's use of private email was never hidden from anyone .\nExperts have said it doesn't appear Clinton violated federal laws ."}

{"article":"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)Rebels seized an international airport in Yemen Sunday as a U.N. envoy warned that the country was at \"the edge of civil war.\" Houthi militants took over the airport in Taiz as they swept through the city and surrounding province, two officials with the Taiz provincial government said. One civilian was killed and 82 others wounded when the rebels fired at local residents protesting their presence, the officials said. The rebels have also seized security and intelligence buildings in Taiz and set up checkpoints in the area, the officials said. Taiz, about 390 kilometers (240 miles) south of Sanaa, is Yemen's cultural capital. The rebels -- Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- surrounded the presidential palace in January. Yemen's President and his Cabinet resigned days later. Ousted President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi says his resignation wasn't valid and maintains that he remains the country's leader. In a statement Sunday, the United Nations Security Council backed Hadi, calling for all sides to end armed hostilities and work out differences at the negotiating table. \"Peaceful dialogue is the only way forward,\" said Jamal Benomar, the U.N.'s special adviser on Yemen. But he gave a dire assessment of the current situation, saying the country is in a \"rapid downward spiral\" and at \"the edge of civil war.\" This isn't the first time the U.N. Security Council has weighed in on the mounting tensions. Last month the council slammed the rebels for taking over democratic institutions and holding officials under house arrest. But so far, it seems calls for calm from around the world have done little to quell the violence. Last week, a Yemeni jet commanded by the Houthi fired missiles at a palace housing Hadi in the port city of Aden. No one was injured, but the direct strike marked an escalation in the deadly fighting between the two sides. That same day, Yemeni military forces -- some under the Houthis, others led by officers loyal to Hadi -- battled in Aden, leaving at least 13 people dead in the clashes, Aden Gov. AbdulAziz Hobtour said. There are growing concerns that terror groups such as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIS could take advantage of the chaos to mount attacks and spread their reach.

{"article":"(CNN)Australia lodged a formal complaint Friday over the treatment of two drug smugglers sentenced to death in Indonesia during their transfer to an island where they are expected to face execution. During the transfer, a senior Indonesian police officer was pictured in photos with the Australian pair on a flight. Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan were being taken from Kerobokan prison in Bali to Nusakambangan island in Central Java, where they will be held in a maximum security facility before facing a 12-man firing squad. The date of the execution is not yet known, although the convicted will be informed at least 72 hours before they are put to death. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs said it had lodged a formal complaint with the Indonesian embassy in Canberra over the treatment of the prisoners during the transfer, which took place before dawn on Wednesday. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told Australian media that an undue show of force, including armored vehicles and dozens of officers in helmets and balaclavas, was also used during the transfer. \"I just cannot comprehend it. They are two men who are described by their own prison governors as model citizens, two gentlemen who pose no risk to anyone,\" she told the ABC's AM program. \"I cannot comprehend the manner or the method of their transfer to the so-called execution island.\" A spokesman for Indonesia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the photos were taken without the consent of the officer involved,  Commissioner Djoko Hari Utomo. \"The officer was inquiring about the physical condition of Mr Chan,\" Arrmanatha Nasir told CNN in regard to one of the images. \"It is regretful that this photo is being used by the media to portray something more than what it really is.\" Australia's complaint comes after Indonesia dismissed a last-minute proposal to save the pair's lives through a prisoner swap. Nasir told CNN that there are no Indonesian laws that would allow or provide for an exchange. \"Indonesia does not have legislation or laws or any other legal instruments that will enable the issue of a prisoner exchange to be conducted,\" he said, adding that the Australian government had been informed of this stance. Sukumaran and Chan, members of the so-called \"Bali Nine\" smuggling ring, have been held by Indonesian authorities for nearly a decade. They are expected to be held in a maximum security facility on Nusakambangan where they will be isolated before being put to death. They are among a number of people from different countries who are also scheduled for execution. Australian government and opposition parliamentarians attended a candlelight vigil at dawn Thursday, as a spectacular sunrise lit politicians from across Australia's political spectrum, united in opposition to the impending executions. \"We appeal to the Indonesian president to grant a stay of clemency,\" Bishop told the gathering. She reminded the Indonesian government that legal avenues remained open, before appealing for mercy on behalf of the convicted men's families. \"I've spoken to the families. They are going through an unimaginably difficult time and I ask that you think of the families who are praying that their son, brother, grandson can have their life spared. We appeal again to President Widodo, the leader of a strong and proud country, to show mercy and forgiveness and spare the lives of these two young Australians.\" Australia has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair. They have been jailed since April 2005 for a failed bid to smuggle more than 8 kilograms of heroin from Bali to Australia. OPINION: Why executions won't win Indonesia's drug war . Prime Minister Tony Abbott said people should not let anger affect Australians' relationship with Indonesia. \"We abhor drug crime, but we abhor the death penalty. We think that these two Australians deserve to be punished, but they certainly don't deserve to be executed,\" he said. The Bali Nine were arrested after Indonesian police received a tip from Australian Federal Police. Chan, 31, was called the ringleader of the plot, and Sukumaran was described as Chan's collaborator in the scheme. Seven other people who participated in the plan are serving lengthy prison sentences. Police caught four people at the Denpasar airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies. Another four -- including Sukumaran -- were arrested at a hotel in the village of Kuta. Chan was detained after a boarding a plane to Sydney -- he wasn't carrying any drugs but was named by others as the mastermind of the plot. The Indonesian administrative court last week dismissed a case filed by lawyers of the two Australians against President Joko Widodo. The attorneys wanted a review of the president's decision to deny them clemency. Todung Mulya Lubis, who represents the pair, said a challenge had been submitted to the administrative court and lawyers were still waiting for a court summons. \"There should be no execution as long as there is a legal process going on,\" Lubis said. Sukumaran and Chan have become model prisoners during their time behind bars, according to fellow inmates and the jail's chief warden. Sukumaran is studying fine arts and has set up a class for fellow inmates. Chan has found spirituality, which he uses to counsel inmates with drug problems. Their rehabilitation is genuine, Bishop has previously said. \"Andrew and Myuran are the model of what penal systems the world over long to achieve,\" she told the Australian Parliament in February. Indonesia has long taken a tough line on drug smugglers, and Widodo has made it clear he doesn't intend to introduce a policy of leniency. In December, six prisoners were killed by firing squad, including five foreigners from Brazil, the Netherlands, Malawi, Nigeria and Vietnam. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff issued a statement saying the execution of one of her countrymen had \"severely affected\" relations with Indonesia. CNN's Steve Almasy, Camille Feanny and Jennifer Deaton contributed to this report.","highlights":"Australia's Foreign Ministry lodges a complaint over the treatment of the two convicted men during a prisoner transfer .\nA police commissioner appears in photos with the men, taken during a flight from Jakarta to Central Java .\nAustralia had offered to swap prisoners for Bali 9 death row duo, but Indonesia says there is no laws that allow for prisoner exchange .\nAustralia PM: We hate drug crime, but we hate capital punishment, too ."}

{"article":"(CNN)German investigators found antidepressants in the apartment of Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz this week, according to published reports. Die Welt, a German newspaper, cited an unidentified senior investigator who said Lubitz suffered from a severe \"psychosomatic illness\" and German police seized prescription drugs that treat the condition. Lubitz suffered from a \"severe subjective burnout syndrome\" and from severe depression, the source told Die Welt. The New York Times also reported that antidepressants were found during the search of his apartment. CNN has not been able to confirm the reports. Investigators continued to work Saturday to piece together the secret life of Lubitz, who officials say was hiding an illness from his employers. He had been declared \"unfit to work\" by a doctor. They were expected to question his relatives, friends and co-workers as they try to pin down what could have prompted the seemingly competent and stable co-pilot to steer a jetliner into a mountainside on Tuesday. As their efforts continued, dozens of people attended a remembrance ceremony for the victims of the crash at a church in a nearby town, Digne-les-Bains. There were 150 people on board Germanwings Flight 9525, including Lubitz. Relatives of the victims and local residents also gathered Saturday afternoon by a simple stone memorial set up near the crash site, in the village of Le Vernet. Flowers have been laid there, in the shadow of the snow-covered peaks of the French Alps. Much attention has focused on Lubitz's state of mind, with some media reports speculating that he may have had mental health issues. Investigators found a letter in the waste bin of his Dusseldorf, Germany, apartment saying that Lubitz, 27, wasn't fit to do his job, city prosecutor Christoph Kumpa said Friday. The note, Kumpa said, had been \"slashed.\" Just what was ailing Lubitz hasn't been revealed. The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported Friday that Lubitz suffered from mental illness and kept his diagnosis concealed from his employer. A subsequent New York Times report on Saturday, citing two officials with knowledge of the investigation, said Lubitz sought treatment before the crash for vision problems that might have put his career at risk. According to those unnamed officials, Lubitz also was being treated for psychological issues. Other media reports indicate he was treated for depression. Lubitz passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014, a German aviation source told CNN. An official with Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, said the exam only tests physical health, not psychological health, and that if Lubitz had vision problems that would have been discovered during the tests. \"We can't believe it. If anything was wrong with his eyes during the physical exam we would have known,\" the official says. The Lufthansa official also said the company was never given any indication Lubitz was depressed, and that if he went to a doctor on his own  he would have been required to self-report if he had been deemed unfit to fly. A Dusseldorf clinic said he'd gone there twice, most recently on March 10, \"concerning a diagnosis.\" But the University Clinic said it had not treated Lubitz for depression. German investigators said they still have interviews and other work to do before they can reveal what they gleaned from the records found in the apartment and at his parents' home in the town of Montabaur. But the fact that investigators found \"ripped, recent medical leave notes, including for the day of the offense, leads to the preliminary conclusion that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment,\" prosecutors said. Germanwings corroborated that assertion, saying it had never received a sick note from Lubitz. Authorities left Lubitz's apartment Friday night with boxes of papers and evidence folders after spending about 90 minutes inside. Dusseldorf police said Saturday that a small team of French investigators had arrived in the city and that they were sharing information. Jean Pierre Michel, lead investigator for the French inquiry, told French TV from Dusseldorf that the French team would work in \"full transparency\" with their German counterparts. \"We will interview people related to the investigation in the coming days. The hearings will be conducted in the coming days and weeks,\" he said, according to CNN's French affiliate BFMTV. Asked by a journalist about reports of Lubitz's possible mental illness, he replied: \"The elements of the investigation are strictly confidential and we cannot address these matters today.\" No scenario can yet be ruled out, including mechanical failure, \"as we do not have the necessary evidence,\" he said. The German tabloid newspaper Bild said Saturday it had interviewed an ex-girlfriend of Lubitz. The woman is not named in the story and CNN has not been able to verify the report independently. According to Bild, the ex-girlfriend said Lubitz was a very nice and sensitive man who needed a lot of care and attention, and he was very troubled. She said he would get into fights with her. The newspaper also cited the ex-girlfriend as saying that Lubitz had bad dreams that his plane was going down. Patrick Sondenheimer was the pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525, according to Reiner Sondenheimer of Dusseldorf, Germany, who says he is a relative of Patrick's. Patrick Sondenheimer is the pilot believed to have been locked out of the cockpit by his co-pilot, Lubitz. CNN spoke to Reiner Sondenheimer at his Dusseldorf apartment. Also at the apartment was a woman who did not provide her name but said she was Patrick Sodenheimer's relative. That woman also said that Patrick Sondenheimer was on the doomed flight. Reiner Sondenheimer declined to say anything else, other than the family wanted time to grieve. The pilot has not been named by German authorities. Another Germanwings pilot who once flew with Lubitz, Frank Woiton, told WDR, a local broadcaster belonging to CNN's German affiliate ARD, that his impression of Lubitz was that he was \"friendly\" and that there was \"nothing suspicious.\" Woiton also said Lubitz \"was a good pilot and had a good command of the plane.\" Woiton's first job after he found out about the crash was the route Dusseldorf-Barcelona-Dusseldorf -- the same route as had been taken by Germanwings Flight 9525 a day earlier. He was praised in German media for the emotional announcement he made to passengers before takeoff, in which he said the crew, like everyone else on the plane, wanted to get home safely to their families. At the scene of the crash, two helicopters were being deployed above the mountainside by recovery crews Saturday. The weather has improved after high winds Friday made their complex task even more treacherous. Lt. Col. Xavier Vialenc, a spokesman for the Gendarmerie, told CNN there were about 40 officers at the crash site Saturday. Once at the crash site, recovery workers spend all day working there, he said. Back in Seyne-les-Alpes at the end of the day, they can see a psychologist if they choose and have a debriefing session with all the workers. Vialenc said the operations were going well so far and that the progress made was meeting their expectations. Yves Naffrechoux, captain of rescue operations at Seyne-les-Alpes, told CNN on Friday that rescuers have found bodies at the rugged crash site, but few of them are intact. It could be weeks before all the bodies are recovered, identified and released to the families, authorities said. What could have prompted Lubitz to deliberately destroy the aircraft, killing everyone on board, remains the focus of investigators in Germany. He had passed medical and psychological testing when he was hired in 2013, said Carsten Spohr, CEO of Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings. Spohr also told reporters that Lubitz had \"interrupted\" his pilot training, which he began in 2008. That break lasted several months, he said, but added that such an interruption isn't uncommon. Spohr didn't give a reason for the break. While the ailment Lubitz had sought treatment for hasn't been revealed, that he was declared unfit for work is an important detail, aviation analysts say. Pilots are required to maintain their fitness to fly and must tell their airline if they're found unfit, CNN aviation analyst David Soucie said. Who was co-pilot Andreas Lubitz? Although authorities have recovered the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder remains missing. It could shed crucial details about what happened inside the cockpit, authorities say. Lubitz was the co-pilot on Tuesday's flight between Barcelona, Spain, and Dusseldorf when he apparently locked the captain out of the cockpit, then activated a control causing the plane to descend toward rugged terrain. Germanwings said the plane dropped for about eight minutes from its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet before crashing. The only sounds, authorities said, were those of pounding on the cockpit door, Lubitz's steady breathing and, eventually, screaming passengers. Lubitz and 149 other people on board the plane died in an instant, authorities say. Most were from Germany and Spain. Mother, daughter among 3 American victims .

{"article":"(CNN)Even with the national chapter shutting the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house at the University of Oklahoma, the school president said the university's affiliation with the fraternity is permanently done as a campus group called for the expulsion of fraternity members. The members have until midnight Tuesday to get their things out of the house, university President David Boren said in a Monday afternoon news conference. \"The house will be closed, and as far as I'm concerned, they won't be back,\" he said, adding that the university is exploring what actions it can take against individual fraternity members. A Saturday video showing party-bound fraternity members on a bus chanting a racial epithet found its way anonymously to the school newspaper and a campus organization, which both promptly publicized the nine-second clip. David Boren: Not just another college president . The students on the bus clap and pump their fists as they boisterously chant, \"There will never be a ni**** SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me.\" By Sunday night, SAE's national chapter had suspended the University of Oklahoma members and threatened lifelong suspensions for anyone responsible for the chant, but Boren took it a step further. He appeared at a campus rally and told students over a bullhorn, \"I have a message for those who have misused their freedom of speech in this way. My message to them is: You're disgraceful. You have violated every principle that this university stands for.\" He said that he was angered, outraged and saddened by what he saw in the video. Boren stressed that the fraternity members' behavior is not indicative of what University of Oklahoma students, nicknamed Sooners, represent. \"It was unbelievable that this could have possibly occurred with UO students,\" he said. \"Sooners are not racists. They're not bigots. They are people who respect each other and care about each other.\" He called for zero tolerance. \"The only way you put a stop to it is have zero tolerance when it is found out. Clearly, I think some of our students wanted this exposed. They wanted this video out there, and I've asked them to please let me know when they're other things like this that happen,\" Boren told CNN. The student newspaper, The Oklahoma Daily, received the video in a Sunday email, said print Editor Katelyn Griffith. The fraternity celebrated its Founder's Day on Saturday, and the video showed members traveling to a formal event that evening, she said. \"We decided that this was definitely a story they needed to cover without question,\" she told CNN. \"This was something that we knew wouldn't be tolerated by the students at OU and the university at large.\" Unheard, a campus organization launched in response to the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, received the video Sunday via anonymous text and immediately moved to \"let our community and our university know that this behavior is not tolerated, that's it's unacceptable and it's extremely, extremely offensive,\" said the group's co-director, Chelsea Davis. This mentality is not new to campus, and it's not confined to one fraternity, Davis told CNN, but it's the first time people have been caught on video. \"Unfortunately, it took them getting caught on video camera for this to happen, but this is definitely not something that is brand-new. It's not something that's only seen within this one organization,\" she said. Davis said the only acceptable response is to expel -- not suspend, as that would send the wrong message -- all the students involved. \"I was hurt that my fellow peers that I walk to class with every day, people that I see every day, could say such hateful things about me and my culture, about my friends, about my brothers and my sisters,\" she said. At a news conference, Boren said the school was looking into punishing the individuals involved, especially against those \"who have taken a lead\" in the chanting. While expulsion is an option, any punishment must be \"carefully directed\" if it's to pass constitutional muster. One key will be whether the offending students created a hostile environment on campus, he said. Boren emphasized that \"there is no room for racists and bigots\" at Oklahoma. \"I think some of the students themselves may take themselves off the campus, and I hope they do because this is not a place that wants racists,\" he told CNN later. That sentiment echoed throughout campus, as a large crowd of students attended a protest at the university's North Oval, some of them arriving with tape over their mouths with the word, \"Unheard,\" written across it. Other students took to social media to express their disappointment, with one person urging students to change their profile picture to an image that says in Sooner crimson, \"Not on our campus,\" the \"ou\" in \"our\" offset in gray. OU is shorthand for the University of Oklahoma. Unheard posted the video online Sunday with the comment, \"Racism is alive at The University of Oklahoma.\" It was addressed to @President_Boren, the university president's Twitter handle. Boren quickly threatened to throw the fraternity off-campus if the allegations were true. The SAE's national chapter also moved promptly, saying in a statement it had closed the chapter \"following the discovery of an inappropriate video.\" The group further apologized for the \"unacceptable and racist behavior of the individuals in the video.\" \"I was not only shocked and disappointed, but disgusted by the outright display of racism displayed in the video,\" SAE national President Bradley Cohen said in a statement. A group of students gathered to pray over the racist insults. One of them told CNN affiliate KFOR-TV he was \"nauseated, frustrated,\" but he was happy with the SAE headquarters' decision. \"We should be past this. This is disgusting,\" he said. Spray paint marked a wall of SAE's fraternity house at the university. \"Tear it down,\" the graffiti appeared to say. Police posted squad cars in front of the house. Members of the Oklahoma football team protested, marching in lieu of meeting and practice. Backlash extended beyond campus as well, with hip-hop star Waka Flocka Flame saying on Instagram that he was canceling an upcoming show for the SAEs. \"All races partying have a good time and enjoying themselves together peacefully. That's what Waka Flocka is all about. For that reason, I must say I'm disgusted and disappointed in the actions of the SAE fraternity at University of Oklahoma and I will be canceling my scheduled performance for them next month. Racism is something I will not tolerate,\" the Atlanta rapper wrote. CNN's Ben Brumfield, Chuck Johnston, Nick Valencia, Tristan Milder, Lindsey Knight, Justin Lear and Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this report.","highlights":"\"Sooners are not racists.

{"article":"Moscow (CNN)Ever since Vladimir Putin came to power, there have been killings of politicians, of human rights activists, of journalists. Boris Nemtsov, one of Russia's most prominent opposition figures, is only the latest victim. The key thing all these crimes have in common is that none of them get properly resolved. Of course, the Kremlin will issue condemnation and condolences, as it has done over the assassination of Nemtsov. But the killers and the people who ordered the killings don't usually end up facing justice -- and if you are an opposition politician in Russia, or a human rights activist, or a journalist, you will know this. If the dangers weren't clear enough, the circumstances of the most recent killing are a stark reminder. It was late Friday night. Boris Nemtsov and his girlfriend Anna Duritskaya, a Ukrainian model, had eaten dinner at plush restaurant on Red Square. Afterwards, despite the chilly weather, they decided to walk back to his apartment, perhaps to take in the stunning views. The Kremlin looks spectacular at night. It was on this short journey, in the heart of Moscow, that the gunman struck, leaving Nemtsov dead within sight of the red Kremlin walls -- walls which, by the way, bristle with security cameras. In the days since, thousands have made pilgrimage to the place where the outspoken Putin critic was shot to pay their respects, leaving a mountain of flowers and personal messages. An opposition rally on Sunday, which Nemtsov was meant to lead, was canceled and replaced with a mourning march past the crime scene. It was the biggest pro-opposition rally in the Russian capital for years. But few who took part could have missed the symbolism, the real message the killers -- whoever they are -- sent by gunning down such a prominent Kremlin critic in the shadow of its towering walls. It's this: if you oppose the Kremlin, if you criticize its power, if you stand for greater democracy and reform, as Boris Nemtsov did, this could happen to you too. It's hard to predict what impact this message will have. \"Yet another terrible page has been turned in the history we all share,\" wrote Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the once-jailed oligarch-turned Kremlin critic now in exile. \"What the next page holds is up to each and every one of us,\" he said, commenting on the death of Nemtsov. The statement was issued under the banner \"We Are Not Afraid\". But many Russians I've spoken to since the killing are, in fact, very afraid. And while the hope among opposition activists is that Nemtsov's killing may at least invigorate their ranks, one very real possibility is that it will do the exact opposite: further silence an already very quiet minority opposed to the rule of Vladimir Putin.","highlights":"A series of Kremlin critics have been murdered since Vladimir Putin came to power .\nThe killing of Boris Nemtsov has struck fear into the hearts of Putin's critics ."}
{"article":"(CNN)The president of Sierra Leone has an idea on how to curtail the spread of Ebola: Get everybody to stay inside. President Ernest Bai Koroma on Saturday launched a campaign called \"Zero Ebola,\" in which almost all Sierra Leoneans are supposed to stay indoors March 27-29 and from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on three consecutive Saturdays -- April 4, 11 and 18. \"The campaign will provide an opportunity for communities to be directly involved in the drive to zero cases, to reflect and to pray for the eradication of this disease from our country,\" he said in a statement. Sierra Leona tried a three-day lockdown last September in what was primarily an informational campaign, with volunteers going door-to-door to talk with residents about the virus. In August, the Liberian government locked down one of the poorest neighborhoods in the capital of Monrovia in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus. The move resulted in riots. No commercial activity is supposed to occur during the upcoming lockdown, Koroma said. Because March 29 is Palm Sunday, church services will be allowed from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Health workers, journalists and public safety officers are exempted. Koroma noted that his country has made \"tremendous progress\" in the fight against the deadly disease as the Ministry of Health reported zero new infections Friday. He warned that the rate of transmissions may increase during the upcoming rainy season. \"The economic development of our country and the lives of our people continue to be threatened by the ongoing presence of Ebola in Sierra Leone,\" he said. \"The future of our country and the aspirations of our children are at stake.\" During Sierra Leone's lockdown last year, Doctors Without Borders said such an effort is unlikely to stop the spread of the disease. \"Large-scale coercive measures like forced quarantines and lockdowns are driving people underground and jeopardizing the trust between people and health providers,\" the charity group said in a statement. \"This is leading to the concealment of cases and is pushing the sick away from health systems.\" Sierra Leone has the largest number of confirmed Ebola cases -- 11,751 so far, according to the World Health Organization. WHO says Liberia has the highest number of deaths -- 4,264. So far, 10,194 have died from Ebola and 24,701 have been infected, according to WHO. Ebola is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. The National Institutes for Health said Thursday it will admit an American health care worker with Ebola to its Maryland hospital. The person was volunteering at an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last Tuesday that 15  American aid workers who had high-risk exposure to Ebola in Sierra Leone have arrived back in the United States for monitoring. None is known to be infected with the disease.

{"article":"(CNN)Two former neighbors of Justin Bieber have filed a lawsuit against the pop star, claiming he and his bodyguards repeatedly harassed them and their family, vandalized their house with eggs and threatened them with anti-Semitic remarks. In the lawsuit Jeffrey and Suzanne Schwartz say Bieber hosted frequent loud parties and spat in Jeffrey Schwartz' face after he complained about the pop star driving his Ferrari at dangerous speeds down the street of their gated community in Calabasas, California. The suit, filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court, also alleges Bieber's bodyguards dismissed Jeffrey Schwartz's complaints by taunting him repeatedly with \"what are you going to do about it, Jew boy?\" The suit seeks unspecified damages and a jury trial. Representatives for Bieber did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday afternoon. The lawsuit comes after Bieber, 21, pleaded guilty last July to a misdemeanor vandalism charge stemming from a January 9, 2014 incident in which the Schwartzes' house was pelted with dozens of eggs. Bieber agreed to pay $80,900 in restitution for damages to the house and was placed on two years' probation. It's the latest chapter in a string of legal troubles for the polarizing former teen idol, who in recent years has been convicted of careless driving and resisting arrest and is facing dangerous driving and assault charges after his ATV collided with a minivan last August in Canada. Thursday's lawsuit alleges a nine-month pattern of \"offensive\" behavior by Bieber and members of his entourage from March 2013 to January 2014. The Schwartzes, who lived next door to Bieber, claim the harassment escalated after a March 27, 2013 episode in which Bieber spat in Jeffrey Schwartz' face and threatened to \"f---ing kill\" him. The following year, after the egging episode made headlines, the Schwartzes say they and their children were subject to \"constant harassment\" by Bieber's entourage, fans and the media. The couple are seeking damages on the grounds of assault and battery and infliction of emotional distress. Bieber sold the Calabasas house for $7. 2 million last year to Khloe Kardashian and has since been renting a $60,000-a-month home in Beverly Hills, according to Forbes.","highlights":"Two former neighbors of Justin Bieber file lawsuit against the pop star .\nSuit alleges he vandalized their house with eggs and threatened them .\nBieber, 21, pleaded guilty last year to a related vandalism charge ."}

Shark Hanlon\u2019s gelding was runner-up in the race last year when outstayed by Dynaste and I wonder, with hindsight, if jockey Andrew McNamara may have employed a more patient ride as he became a sitting target late on. A recent Punchestown romp should have put the selection spot-on and he could go one better this year and end the Irish hoodoo in this race. With the Willie Mullins stable carrying all before them, Vautour will be a popular order in the JLT Novices\u2019 Chase. However, he will be priced accordingly and VALSEUR LIDO (Cheltenham, 1.30) looks a sound alternative as he was reported to be a little ring-rusty when edged out by Apache Stronghold at Leopardstown last time. Hidden Cyclone, pictured during the Paddy Power Gold Cup in 2013, was rerouted for the Ryanair Chase . The selection had previously beaten that foe by an impressive eight lengths at Fairyhouse and appears to jump a shade more fluently than Noel Meade\u2019s charge, who remains one of the chief dangers. There will be plenty of tips doing the rounds for the Pertemps Network Final but TRUSTAN TIMES (Cheltenham, nap, 2.05) is a solid conveyance for a race of this nature and may run well at a big price. The nine-year-old lacks the profile of a number of his rivals, but was a creditable third in the race last year \u2014 beaten by just a nose and a neck \u2014 and looks to have been campaigned with just one race in mind all season.","highlights":"Saphir Du Rheu backed for the 3.20 at Cheltenham on Thursday .\nHidden Cyclone has been rerouted for Thursday\u2019s Ryanair Chase .\nTrustan Times may run well at a big price for the Pertemps Network Final .\nCheltenham racing tips: Not sure who to back?

{"article":"Many people turn to sport when times get tough and pretty Amy Brown is no exception. When the 21-year-old suffered cruel taunts at school for gaining good grades and wearing boy's clothes, she took her frustrations out on the rugby field. From the age of 12, Amy, who lives in the Forest of Dean, played at least twice a week for her local club. Scroll down for video . Scrummy: Rugby-loving Amy Brown, 21, from the Forest of Dean is a finalist in the Miss England competition . Beauty and brains: Amy turned to the rugby pitch after her schoolmates teased her for being clever...she says that 'she's now having the last laugh' Nearly ten years on, Amy has blossomed into a young beauty, so much so that her\u00a0friends suggested she enter a local beauty pageant. Last month she was crowned Miss Forest of Dean, just in time for the Six Nations. Amy, who stands 5ft 8ins tall, will swap her muddy boots for high heels when she competes in the semi-finals of Miss England in June. Amy, who is studying Criminology at the University of Gloucester, said: 'I never expected to come this far. I've never been into high heels and dresses. 'For me, it was always rugby and drinking with the lads in the bar afterwards. The closest I ever had to having a picture taken was doing a selfie. 'I never ever thought of myself as being particularly glam. Before I got into rugby I was bullied at school. Try! Amy turned out twice a week for her local side from the age of 12 . The 'boffin' has grown up: Amy now has a boyfriend, 22-year-old gym instructor Ben Jones . More comfortable in boots: Amy says that she had to practice 'loads' to walk properly wearing heels . 'I wasn't very popular and worked hard so the bullies called me 'boffin' and 'ugly'. Even in my teens I didn't wear makeup and played rugby to deal with the name calling. 'It was a way I could get my frustration out but I really enjoy it. I'm in the second row so I'm in the thick of the action. 'I always get stuck in and I've got knocked out twice. I haven't got any cauliflower ears thankfully.' Amy, who has a long term boyfriend, gym instructor Ben Jones, 22, has beaten thousands of hopefuls to reach the semi-finals of Miss England. She added: 'I never thought I'd make it to the semi-finals of Miss England. It's been an amazing journey. 'Before the competition I'd never been on a cat walk. The first time I put on high heels I tottered about and almost lost my balance so I've had to practice loads. 'It's a great feeling to get glammed up now, especially when I think back to the abuse I got from the bullies. I do feel like I've had the last laugh.'","highlights":"Amy Brown, 21, was teased at school for being a 'boffin'\nShe turned to rugby, playing twice a week from the age of 12 .\nNow she's reached the finals of Miss England .\n'Almost lost her balance' the first time she put on heels ."}
{"article":"Washington (CNN)The U.S. ambassador who resigned his post in 2012 amidst official criticism that he used a private email account for official business told CNN Friday that he was \"very surprised\" to learn that his boss at the time, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, had been doing essentially the same thing at the same time. \"I was very surprised to learn of the double standard,\" former Ambassador to Kenya and Air Force General Scott Gration told CNN. Gration noted that Cheryl Mills, the then-State Department Chief of Staff \"obviously knew Secretary Clinton was using commercial email, yet she stated my use of Gmail was one of the reasons I had to move on.\" The retired Air Force Major General, who flew 274 combat missions over Iraq as a fighter pilot and served as President Obama's Special Envoy to Sudan, recalled he had been \"prohibited from sending a Gmail message to a State Department computer except in an emergency.\" Considering that \"Department of Defense dot mil accounts, USAID accounts, and every Kenyan account used the same routers and security firewalls as a Gmail account,\" he took issue with State Department protocols. \"It didn't make sense to me that the State Department would ban my 'Gmail.com' while letting all other commercial and foreign accounts through its computer firewall,\" he told CNN. A spokesman for Hillary Clinton declined comment. Spokespeople at the State Department repeatedly declined to address whether any sort of double standard had been applied and instead continually noted that in the State Department Inspector General report  about the U.S. embassy being run by Gration there were \"several concerns with management and leadership\" discussed, not just about his use of private email. The Inspector General report charged that Gration \"lost the respect and confidence of the staff to lead the mission\" and \"damaged the cohesion of Embassy Nairobi's country team.\" Gration said he makes \"no apology for 'rocking the boat' in the State Department to improve physical security, to enhance cyber policy, and to conduct several other initiatives that the State Department Inspector General misrepresented to build the case that Secretary Clinton's Chief of Staff used to terminate my tenure as the U.S. ambassador in 2012.\" The State Department's continued referencing of the other allegations against Gration came amidst fruitless attempts by CNN to ask the department spokespeople to explain why it was acceptable for Secretary Clinton to use private email to conduct official business given that the 2012 Inspector General's report against Gration repeatedly hammered him for the use of \"commercial email for official government business\" which was considered to be \"flouting of direct instructions to adhere to Department policy.\" As CNN reported Thursday, the report stated clearly that It \"is the Department's general policy that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized information system, which has the proper level of security controls,\" the report stated. \"The use of unauthorized information systems increases the risk for data loss, phishing, and spoofing of email accounts, as well as inadequate protections for personally identifiable information. The use of unauthorized information systems can also result in the loss of official public records as these systems do not have approved record preservation or backup functions. Conducting official business on non- Department automated information systems must be limited to only maintaining communications during emergencies.\" Asked if he was subsequently surprised to see this controversy erupt about his then-boss doing essentially the same thing, Gration told CNN \"I'm not surprised when any political issue becomes a controversy.  I learned long ago to do your best, do what was right, and to have a thick skin.  I still wake up each day without regrets because I still have my integrity.  That said, illegal, immoral, or unethical activities should be investigated properly, not just for political gain, but because we demand this of our public leaders. That's the only way we can preserve trust in our system of governance.  Punish crimes and forgive mistakes.\" Gration said that his \"experience was somewhat different than Secretary Clinton's use of her commercial account, yet I was 'fired' for the use of Gmail in the U.S. Embassy, my insistence on improving our physical security posture, and other twisted and false allegations.  I've chosen to move on and to be better, not bitter.\" He said that \"the State Department Inspector General investigators and Diplomatic Security cyber investigators conducted a full and formal investigation into my use of Gmail and the State Department computers\" and \"they dismissed the allegations against me.\" The former ambassador and his wife currently live in Kenya, where he is executive chairman of a company that works to bring international investment and innovation to Kenya and East Africa. He is no longer involved in US politics and diplomacy.","highlights":"Fmr. ambassador forced to resign in 2012 amidst criticism over personal email use at the State Department.\nClaims accusations against him unwarranted.

{"article":"(CNN)President Barack Obama shared jokes about pot and Hillary Clinton's email controversy at the annual Gridiron Club dinner in Washington on Saturday. The club's dinner brings together Washington's media elite, with noteworthy politicians typically attending, as well. Despite being held by a media organization that raises scholarship funds for journalism students, the dinners are generally closed to cameras. Organizers only allowed a select few pool reporters to enter while the President spoke. The lack of media glare allows guests to let some of their guard down, perhaps unleashing a few more jokes than they might if the cameras were rolling. At one point Obama, clad in a white tie, predicted he would get more laughs this year than in the past. \"I'm not saying I'm any funnier. I'm saying weed is now legal in D.C.,\" he said. Voters in the District of Columbia legalized small amounts of marijuana last year, much to the chagrin of some in Congress. The President also touched on the controversy over the archiving of Clinton's emails while she was secretary of state. Obama lamented that while he was once a tech-savvy candidate, Clinton now seemed more up to speed. \"Now I'm yesterday's news, and Hillary has got a server in her house. I didn't even know you could have one of those in your house. I am so far behind. Did you know that? I would have gotten one,\" he joked. The domain name for Clinton's private email address was @clintonemail.com. Obama wasn't the only politician attending this year's dinner. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker also dropped in. He's of course rumored to be in contention to run for president in 2016. Walker, a Republican, acknowledged some headlines of his own, like when Rudy Giuliani said at a Walker event last month that he doesn't think Obama loves America. To date, Walker hadn't said whether he agreed with Giuliani or not. \"I want to get this out of the way once and for all. I believe President Obama loves America and every single American in it.  Except for Rudy Giuliani,\" Walker said, according to a transcript provided by his staff. \"If I did not love America, I wouldn't have moved here from Kenya,\" Obama later countered in a joking reference to unsubstantiated theories that he wasn't born in the United States. Every president since 1885 except for Grover Cleveland has attended the 130-year-old organization's dinner. Obama has attended three times as president and last attended back in 2013.","highlights":"\"If I did not love America, I wouldn't have moved here from Kenya,\" Obama quips .\nHe was attending the annual Gridiron Club dinner where politicians crack jokes ."}
{"article":"New Delhi (CNN)A gang of robbers struck a Christian school in eastern India on Saturday, and one of them raped a 71-year-old nun, a senior official said. The man apparently did so, because she resisted the robbers, said P.B. Salim, chief administrator of the West Bengal state's Nadia district. Previously, a church official had told CNN sister broadcaster CNN-IBN that three or four of the men had raped the woman. A group of seven to eight men allegedly barged into the school and its attached staff residence during pre-dawn hours, and the elderly Sister Superior raised an alarm and resisted, Salim said. The rape was apparently punishment for it. Later, the men tied her up along with two other nuns and the building guard. The robbers then made off with cash worth a few hundred thousand rupees (thousands of dollars), laptops and other articles, Salim said. The attacked nun is under medical care. \"Physically, she is better. But the mental trauma will take its own time to heal,\" Salim said. \"It is a very, very shameful act, first of all, to rape any woman, any female,\" Father Dominic Emmanuel of the Delhi Catholic Archdiocese said in televised comments. \"But this one becomes even worse because, first of all, she is an old lady and then on top of it, she is a nun. She is a religious (and) has consecrated her life to God and all her life she has remained a virgin.\" The investigation into the burglary and rape is ongoing, and no arrests have yet been made, Salim told CNN. A series of rape cases involving girls, foreign tourists and a physiology student who died following a brutal gang rape in 2012 has hurt India's international reputation. Crowds have taken to Indian streets to protest against rape. The nation's lawmakers introduced tougher laws and punishments for sexual crimes and harassment. Despite such action, India continues to see episodes of sexual violence. For instance, five men were arrested in Kolkata in January and charged with raping a Japanese tourist. Police said the men operated as a gang and targeted single, Japanese tourists. In December, an Uber driver was charged with sexually assaulting a passenger. The incident that grabbed the world's attention was the rape of a woman by five men  on a bus in 2012. She later died of her injuries. Anti-rape activists complained when the Indian government restricted the showing of a BBC documentary about rape that included comments from one of those men. He provoked outrage around the world by blaming the victim and saying the woman \"should just be silent and allow the rape.\" Official data in India show that rape cases have jumped almost 875% over the past 40 years -- from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011. But campaigners say sexual assaults are underreported because of stigma and cultural factors. Experts say the causes of the high number of rapes include the nation's patriarchy, widespread poverty and lack of law enforcement in rural areas.","highlights":"Official says men broke into a convent school and one sexually assaulted a septuagenarian nun .\nA series of publicized rapes have occurred in India in recent years ."}
{"article":"There was a time in 2012 when just about every selfie going was doctored by a grinning picture of John Terry, super-imposed in his full Chelsea kit and lifting the European Cup. Their captain popped up all over the internet, a subject of ridicule after missing the Champions League final against Bayern Munich in the Allianz Arena through suspension. This time he wore the Chelsea strip for real, lifting the Capital One Cup high up in the Wembley stands and dancing like a dad in front of their celebrating fans behind the goal in the West Stand. John Terry lifts the Capital One Cup after captaining Chelsea to victory over Tottenahm Hotspur . Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris watches as Terry's shot finds the back of the net during the first half . Diego Costa, Terry and Gary Cahill celebrate the opening goal of the game in London . Terry was man of the match here by a distance, driving this team towards their first trophy since Jose Mourinho returned with a performance that sent shivers down the spine. He scored Chelsea\u2019s opener on the stroke of half-time, a finish that settled any anxiety and pretty much any doubt about the destination of this year\u2019s Capital One Cup. After that, he was peerless. The Capital One Cup is a level or two down from the European Cup, or the three Barclays Premier League titles he has won at Chelsea during a 17-year career at Stamford Bridge \u2014 but one look at the Chelsea captain told you it really mattered. This was further confirmation, as if it were needed, of his class. His last-ditch tackle on Tottenham\u2019s talisman Harry Kane, sprinting across to cover for his team-mate Gary Cahill in the final minutes here, evoked memories of the days when he was rated best in the world in his position. Former Atletico Madrid forward Costa had a hand in the second goal of the game on Sunday afternoon . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho and Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino watch on from the sidelines . Goalscorer Terry celebrates with Costa during their Capital One Cup final win in London . It hurt like hell for Terry to miss out on the Champions League final, that one night in Munich when Chelsea finally realised their ambition to win the biggest club cup in European football. At the age of 34 he plays one season at a time now, waiting for the call from Chelsea technical director Michael Emenalo or director Marina Granovskaia to tell him that he will be staying on for another campaign. That conversation is coming, \u2018a formality\u2019 according to Mourinho recently as Terry matured into a new role at the heart of the Chelsea defence. Incredible as it sounds, opposition managers and their players have yet to suss out that Terry has passed on the main responsibility of marking to his usual central defensive partner Cahill. That savvy move added another five years to Alessandro Costacurta\u2019s career with AC Milan when it was put to him by Carlo Ancelotti at the turn of the millennium. Here, after lifting the first trophy since Mourinho returned to Stamford Bridge, Terry played like he could go on for another thousand years. Terry slides in to block a shot from Tottenham's top scorer Harry Kane during the second half . Mourinho has been instrumental in Terry's return to form, inspiring new motivation in his captain . Fellow defender Cahill has taken over many of the marking duties that Terry used to perform himself . Kane went cold here, frozen out by the discipline of Cahill \u2014 comfortably his best performance of the season \u2014 and the organisational ability of Chelsea\u2019s captain alongside him. Cahill was terrorised by Kane in the 5-3 defeat at White Hart Lane on January 1, roughed up by the Tottenham striker and losing his guaranteed place in Chelsea\u2019s team as a result. Terry is talking this team through games, just as Marcel Desailly did when he returned to Stamford Bridge after winning the World Cup with France in 1998. Terry has matured these past couple of years and it is at times like this when you begin to wonder what else he could have achieved if he had kept his nose clean. The rehabilitation will never quite be complete, never quite final because he has never spoken about the day in 2011 when he racially insulted Anton Ferdinand. He really ought to speak about it because even if the words he used at Loftus Road that day are unacceptable, society will accept an apology, or a least an explanation. Football can be a forgiving place. The Chelsea squad celebrate their cup success following the final whistle in the capital . Didier Drogba, Terry and full back Branislav Ivanovic celebrate their first trophy since Mourinho's return . Chelsea's captain and manager embrace after the Portuguese coach's first trophy since 2012 . Chelsea supporters see him differently, in awe as he added to his collection of trophies by hauling his team towards their first major honour of the new Mourinho era. This was a reminder of days gone by, taking those familiar with his career back to his goal for England in this stadium when he rose into the night sky to head home a David Beckham cross against Brazil in 2007. Those days are a distant memory and even England manager Roy Hodgson, admiring this performance from the stands, accepts that Terry will never play for the national side again. Everybody has moved on, and rightly so. He has played at the highest level and yet he reached new heights here, leading his team up the Wembley staircase and leading the celebrations when he collected the trophy. Dressed head to toe in Chelsea\u2019s blue strip, Terry wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.","highlights":"Chelsea beat Tottenham 2-0 in the Capital One Cup final .\nJohn Terry scored the opening goal, Diego Costa had a hand in the second .\nTerry has seen a return to form since Jose Mourinho rejoined the club .\nThe Blues' captain has redefined his game to involve more delegation ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Europe is in the midst of a political and economic crisis that threatens to unravel decades of European integration and derail the world's recovery from the great recession. To understand this crisis, let's compare two countries. Country A is a small nation with a long history of tax evasion, government debt defaults and a dysfunctional business and regulatory climate. It allows workers to retire in their 50s, and pays double pensions when they do. It lied about its budget to get into the eurozone. Country B is a large, historically powerful nation with a record of low government debt. Country B even ran budget surpluses, including a 2% surplus just before the financial crisis hit in 2008.  It entered the eurozone with an honest accounting of its finances. If you guessed that country A is Greece, you are correct.  If you believe Greece has caused the crisis in Europe because of its fiscal irresponsibility, then you are safely in the mainstream opinion about the matter. But what do we make of fiscally responsible country B?  Its virtuousness must mean it is weathering the crisis. And it must be Germany, right? Wrong. Country B is not Germany. Country B is Spain. Far from prospering, Spain is doing terribly. Spain's unemployment rate is 23.7%, down from a high of almost 27% in 2013.  More than a fifth of its workers have been jobless for the last four years. More than half of its young people are out of work and have been for years. There is regularly talk of a lost generation in Spain and Greece. Like Greece, Spain's investment bubble burst when the financial crisis hit and it had to seek a bailout (although a much smaller one) to prevent its domestic banks from collapsing. Spain's economy also shrank during the crisis and its debt to GDP ratio has shot up dramatically. If Greece and Spain have such wildly different approaches to fiscal prudence, what can explain the crisis they both find themselves in? The answer is not fiscal virtue. Something else is going on. That something else, in large part, is the euro. Joining the eurozone meant Spain and Greece gave up the power to create money, the power to devalue their currency to restore competitiveness, and the power to set interest rates. These are not trivial concessions, especially in a currency union like the euro where transfers between rich and poor sectors of the economy are limited, strict budget rules deny individual countries the flexibility to react to a crisis, and trade between euro-area nations is severely imbalanced. The inability to set interest rates in line with the economic conditions meant that in the early 2000s, Spain and Greece couldn't raise interest rates to cool their over-heating economies. The over-heating was largely caused, by the way, by the frenzied (and ultimately reckless) lending in both countries by German and other core European banks. The European Central Bank set interest rates in line with economic conditions in Germany and France that proved too low for Spain and Greece (and Ireland). Read: 25 People to Blame for the Financial Crisis . The over-heating of the Greek and Spanish economies led to inflation and investment bubbles. As those bubbles burst, the banks neared collapse, and their rescue led ultimately to a sovereign debt crisis. The inability of Spain and Greece to print money meant they had to borrow from their partners in Europe or default and be ignominiously tossed out of the EU. Strict budget rules of Eurozone membership also required Spain and Greece to impose austerity measures in the middle of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. They were required to raise taxes and cut spending even as unemployment reached astronomical levels. Austerity helped create a depression of historic magnitude in Greece and a severe recession in Spain. The policies also created runaway public debt. Greece's debt is now 175% of GDP. Spain's debt to GDP ratio is 100% -- a level not seen in Spain in more than 100 years. Because Spain and Greece cannot devalue the euro, the only way they can become competitive is through internal devaluation. This means Greece and Spain are in for years of high unemployment, reduced living standards, falling wages and deflation. In other words, massive impoverization. Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, famously said: \"The euro is forever.\" That may or may not be so, but it doesn't mean that countries like Greece and Spain should stay in the euro forever. Contrary to popular opinion, this crisis cannot be explained away with a moral tale of Greek fiscal irresponsibility. The facts suggest otherwise.","highlights":"If Greece and Spain have such different approaches to fiscal prudence, Lisa Tripp asks why both are in crisis?\nSomething else is going on, she says: That something else, in large part, is the euro ."}
{"article":"Washington (CNN)A 17-year-old Virginia student has been charged with helping recruit for ISIS, federal law enforcement officials said Wednesday. The teen, whose name was not disclosed, was taken into custody last week, the officials said. Prosecutors are seeking to charge him as an adult but currently have charged him as a juvenile, one of the law enforcement officials said. The case remains under seal.  It was first reported by The Washington Post on Wednesday. The Post, citing officials and neighbors, reported that investigators spent more than a month watching the teen and his home before he was arrested. The teen, who lives in a Virginia suburb of Washington, is accused of helping a slightly older adult travel to Syria. The adult is believed to have joined ISIS there, a separate law enforcement official said. The teen is also accused of distributing ISIS messages to a network of contacts, one of the officials said. The teen is an \"intelligent kid,\" a man who hired him to write for a digital currency news website said Wednesday evening. Dustin O'Bryant, the editor of the website Coin Brief from Alabama, said: \"He did not come across as radical in any way.\" The teen wrote freelance articles for the website for seven months last year. He was told not to bring religion into his writing, O'Bryant said, adding he had noticed the young man had written online posts about his faith. The teen complied, he said. The website editor said he was \"extremely, extremely surprised\" to learn of the arrest from reporters calling him. He hadn't spoken to the teen since February, when the young man said he was dealing with personal matters but wanted to start writing for the website again at some point this year. Give me two weeks to three months, the boy told him. O'Bryant said he is shocked by the charge. \"I hope there's some sort of misunderstanding here, and that he didn't know what he was doing,\" he said. He added that he didn't realize the teen was in high school because he had college courses on his resume. More than 20,000 foreigners have gone to fight for ISIS, the radical Islamist group that controls portions of Iraq and Syria, experts have told Congress. National Intelligence Director James Clapper said 180 Americans have tried to go to fight in Syria. It's unclear how many of those were attempting to join ISIS. It was also unknown if the man the teen allegedly helped is a U.S. citizen. The names: Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West . Others have been prevented from going there or providing support. Also Wednesday, a 21-year-old California man arrested last summer was indicted, changed with attempting to support terror and other counts. Adam Dandach, of Orange, California, was accused by the FBI in the indictment of attempting to provide himself and material support to work under the direction and control of ISIS. He will be arraigned March 16. California man accused of trying to join ISIS . In February, three men from New York -- Abdurasul Juraboev, 24; Akhror Saidakhmetov, 19; and Abror Habibov, 30 -- were arrested and charged with conspiring to provide material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization. An unsealed criminal complaint accused one of the men of discussing a potential attempt to assassinate President Barack Obama. One had discussed hijacking a flight and handing it over to ISIS, the complaint said. Four women from Colorado have been accused of attempting to join ISIS. Three Denver teenagers, who investigators say were recruited via social media, were stopped in Germany in October and sent back to the United States. After being arrested in spring 2014, Shannon Maureen Conley was one of the first Americans sentenced for conspiracy to support ISIS. Two men who have appeared in horrific ISIS propaganda videos could be from the United States or Canada, according to analysts. The individuals, both of whom are shown wearing masks covering everything but their eyes, spoke in what sounded like North American accents. One was in a video entitled \"Flames of War,\" which shows the execution of a handful of men. The other militant is the speaker in ISIS' first propaganda video out of Libya, which ends with the graphic beheading of more than a dozen Egyptian Christians. CNN's Brian Todd and Pamela Brown reported from Washington. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz reported from New York.","highlights":"Website boss tells CNN that teen didn't seem radical to him .\nThe teen, who lives in a Virginia suburb of Washington, is accused of helping a slightly older adult travel to Syria .\nTeen, whose name was not disclosed, was taken into custody last week, officials say ."}
{"article":"Beijing (CNN)Five years ago, Beijinger Robert Zhao went on a trip to Tibet. What he encountered left him confused but intrigued. A science graduate from China's elite Tsinghua University, he had been taught to mistrust superstition and religion, but in the culture and devotion of the Buddhists he met he found something worth knowing. Now 25, he is considering giving up his job and becoming a monk. \"It means I will have to give up everything of the ordinary world,\" he told CNN. While Buddhism has a long history in China, entering via missionaries from India during the Han dynasty, it was repressed during the Maoist era -- many monasteries and temples were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution and monks actively punished for believing in \"superstition.\" But now, a growing number of Chinese are rediscovering the country's dormant Buddhist traditions. Some, like Zhao, are looking for a spiritual anchor in a competitive,  fast-changing society. Others take comfort in meditation and enjoy volunteering. However, it's not always easy to combine Buddhist beliefs with the demands of modern life. Zhao works as an assistant to the boss of an environmental company. His religion means it's difficult to entertain clients and partners -- a key part of the role. \"Not drinking, smoking or eating meat affects my socializing. So the company has to send someone else to go with me, which creates extra expenses,\" he says. Zhao has not told his family about his desire to become a monk yet, fearing that they might oppose it. Fenggang Yang, the director of the Center on Religion and Chinese Society at Purdue University, Indiana, says it's difficult to explain exactly why so many young people are turning to Buddhism. Some discover it at university, where Buddhist groups are active and famous monks and lamas give lectures.  Others have devout parents and grandparents. He also says that the Chinese Communist Party policy has \"moved toward treating Buddhism more favorably than other religions.\" Christianity has also been growing in popularity in recent decades but church leaders say there has been a crackdown on Christians,  with authorities demolishing churches and removing crosses from skylines. In particular, it's the Tibetan strain of Buddhism, rather than the Chan (also called Zen) tradition once popular in China, that is attracting new converts, particularly students, young professionals and businesspeople, he says. \"It appears that both the chanting and the physical, spiritual practices of Tibetan Buddhism are appealing to some people,\" Yang added. To what extent these new converts are committed to Buddhism as a religion, with its strictures and rituals, is an open question. A former leader of a university Buddhism group, who didn't want to give his name, told CNN he thought its members were more interested in the religion as a lifestyle choice. Activities that his group organized focusing on relaxation and stress relief were always more popular than reading groups and lectures that examined Buddhist scriptures, he added. Yang at Purdue University says that for most people in China, Buddhism is treated more as culture than a religion. They may visit temples or read Buddhist books, but  few people treat it as a religion that requires serious commitment. \"Indeed, people who identify as Buddhists do a lot of non-Buddhist spiritual things, such as believing in feng shui, consulting fortune-tellers, practicing qi gong and sampling books and practices of other religions,\" he says. On a recent weekend, more than four hundred people attended the annual gathering of Beijing Ren Ai Foundation, a Buddhist charitable organization, at Longquan Monastery on the mountainous outskirts of the capital. Zhong Ying, the group's 32-year-old deputy secretary general, said the group's most active volunteers were between 20 and 35 years old. In the past five years their numbers had doubled to 200. For attendee Geng Hui'er, a 26-year-old who works and lives in Beijing, Buddhism was something she rediscovered after returning from studying abroad in England. Growing up, her family had raised her Buddhist although she says she never really \"felt it.\" She now regularly attends meditation activities in monasteries or study groups organized by volunteers. Geng says Buddhism has given her a fresh outlook on life and past difficulties.

{"article":"(CNN)Cody Simpson just wants to make the world happy. That's why the Australian-born pop star is in Austin, Texas, this week, where he will be performing at a United Nations\/MixRadio brunch at the SXSW festival. Simpson, 18, is the spokesman for the #HappySoundsLike playlist, promoting the U.N.'s International Day of Happiness on Friday, March 20. The singer and other celebs selected tracks for the playlist. \"There is honestly nothing I can think of that I like to do more than make other people happy through live music,\" said Simpson, who will perform a few acoustic tracks at the SXSW brunch. The International Day of Happiness is a global celebration that came about after the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution in 2011 recognizing happiness as a \"fundamental human goal.\" The observation was decreed in 2012 after the first  U.N. conference on happiness, and the first Day of Happiness was held on March 20, 2013. Simpson said it makes sense to have music as such an important part of the day. \"I want to be able to share a message of happiness,\" the singer said. \"I think music is such an escape for people.\" He selected Bob Marley's \"Three Little Birds\" for the playlist. Britney Spears selected Prince's \"Kiss,\" and Pharrell picked Talking Heads' \"This Must Be the Place.\" Ed Sheeran, David Guetta, Charlize Theron, John Legend and James Blunt are also among those taking part. Simpson recently released a cover of Marley's \"No Woman No Cry\" and said the legendary reggae artist is a personal inspiration. \"The majority of music today has no substance,\" said Simpson, who is an independent artist. \"You want to be able to feel something true.\" As for what makes Simpson the happiest (other than music, of course), he said it's the simple things like relaxing with his family and just slowing down. \"Happiness is kind of taken from you if your mind is too busy,\" he said. \"Be present in that moment.\" Fans are being encouraged to post the song that makes them the happiest using the social media hashtag #HappySoundsLike.","highlights":"Simpson helped curate the playlist to celebrate the UN's International Day of Happiness .\nHe will mark the day by performing at the SXSW festival .\nFans are encouraged to share the songs that make them happy ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Here's a pair of twins no one will have trouble telling apart: One is white, and one is black. Thanks to a rare quirk of nature, Lucy is the alabaster-skinned redhead, and Maria has their part-Jamaican mother's dark skin and hair. Images of the Aylmer sisters of Gloucester, United Kingdom, rocketed around the Internet this week when a British newspaper carried their story. \"I can't stop crying! This is all so amazing,\" Lucy Aylmer posted on Facebook. The girls were born to a white father and a biracial mom in 1997, according to the Daily Mail story that started all the fuss. 'No one ever believes we are twins,\" the newspaper quoted Lucy Aylmer as saying. \"Even when we dress alike, we still don't look like sisters, let alone twins.\" Appearing Tuesday on \"Good Morning Britain,\" the sisters said they're always facing doubters who can't believe they are related, much less twin sisters. Some even asked whether Lucy was adopted, she told the show. \"It was pretty hard,\" she said. \"It went on in secondary school as well, and it wasn't very nice.\" Maria said they've been told the chances of such an occurrence are \"one in a million.\" The BBC, reporting on a similar case in 2011, said it was more like 1 in 500. No matter the odds, the sisters say they're happy with how they look. \"Maria loves telling people at college that she has a white twin -- and I'm very proud of having a black twin,\" Lucy told the Daily Mail. \"My family is beautiful,\" she posted on Facebook.","highlights":"UK twins, one white and one black, have had to fight to prove they're sisters .\n\"My family is beautiful,\" one sister posts on Facebook ."}
{"article":"(CNN)A Chilean girl's plea via social media for an assisted suicide caught the attention of the person the teen thinks could make it happen: President Michelle Bachelet. Bachelet visited 14-year-old Valentina Maureira on Saturday after the girl's video went viral and spurred debate in Chile about euthanasia. Valentina was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when she was 6. Her older brother died from the same disease. Cystic fibrosis is a life-threatening disease that damages the lungs and digestive system. Valentina's family has already witnessed how the disease can be terminal. Valentina's suffering includes vomiting and headaches that are constant, according to her father, Freddy Maureira. The teen recently posted a video on her Facebook page, asking Bachelet to allow her to end her life. \"I am tired of living with this sickness,\" Valentina says in the video. \"Please authorize an injection so I can sleep forever.\" Bachelet visited Valentina on Saturday for more than an hour at the hospital. The country's minister of health also attended. During the visit, the President learned details about Valentina's health, whose condition has reportedly slightly improved, CNN Chile reported. The teen thanked Bachelet for the visit, and her father said he is holding on to hope for a lung transplant for his daughter, according to CNN Chile. Before the visit, the President had already stated her position on the impossibility of an assisted suicide for the girl. Not even the President can agree to Valentina's request because Chilean law does not allow euthanasia, Presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizaldo said. \"But what are we doing?\" Elizaldo said last week. \"The health ministry is in constant contact with Valentina's family, and we will provide all the emotional and psychological support and medical treatment to improve her living conditions.\" Valentina's case has caused an overwhelming response on social media. People took to Facebook and Twitter to discuss the debate on assisted suicide. One Twitter user posed the question in a tweet: \"After the case of Valentina Maureira, should euthanasia be legal?\" Doctor Andres Castillo, chief of pediatrics at Catholic University's Clinic Hospital, said that at the moment, Valentina's condition is stable.\" After her diagnosis, doctors expected her to live to about 17, which would give her three and a half more years to live.","highlights":"14-year-old Valentina Maureira suffers from cystic fibrosis .\nIn a video, she asks the President to allow her to have an assisted suicide ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Nigeria's military says its forces have retaken the northeastern town of Gwoza, which Boko Haram militants last year declared the headquarters of their \"caliphate.\" The announcement comes on the eve of the West African country's general elections. \"Just this morning, the gallant troops of the Nigerian military in a concerted and well-coordinated land and air operations have liberated Gwoza, the headquarters of their so-called caliphate,\" Major General Chris Olukolade said in a Defense Ministry statement Friday. Olukolade said the troops had routed Boko Haram fighters in towns and villages leading to Gwoza. \"Several of the terrorists have died and many of them captured in the process. A lot of arms and ammunition have been recovered and the administrative headquarters completely destroyed.  A massive cordon and search has commenced to locate any of the fleeing terrorists or hostages in their custody,\" Olukolade said. Boko Haram declared its own \"caliphate\" after seizing the area around Gwoza, in Borno state, in August 2014, according to the Chatham House think tank. The militant group has purportedly pledged allegiance to ISIS and says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between the majority Muslim north and the mostly Christian south. Nigeria's general elections take place Saturday . The polls had been scheduled for February 14, but on February 7, Nigeria's election commission announced they would be postponed for six weeks due to security concerns, with the military needing more time to secure areas controlled by Boko Haram. The controversial decision was unpopular among many Nigerians and led to widespread protests. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, who is running for reelection, has been criticized for not doing enough to combat Boko Haram. On Friday, Jonathan referenced the Gwoza victory in a broadcast to the nation, praising Nigeria's armed forces for their \"immense sacrifices\" in defending the nation. \"We are also glad that our gallant armed forces have successfully stemmed the seizure of Nigerian territories in the northeast by the terrorist group, Boko Haram,\" Jonathan said. \"They have recaptured most of the communities and territories formerly occupied by the insurgents, making it possible for thousands of internally displaced Nigerians to begin returning to their homes and communities.\" Jonathan said security agencies were fully prepared to deal decisively with \"any group or persons who attempt to disrupt the peaceful conduct of the elections.\" \"Those who may harbor any intentions of testing our will by unleashing violence during the elections in order to advance their political ambitions should think again as all necessary measures have been put in place to ensure that any persons who breach the peace or cause public disorder during or after the elections are speedily apprehended and summarily dealt with according to our laws,\" the President said. On Thursday, Jonathan and Maj. Gen. Muhammad Buhari, the other leading presidential candidate, issued a pledge reaffirming their commitment to \"free, fair and credible elections\" following their signing of a nonviolence pledge -- the Abuja Accord -- in January. The International Criminal Court also issued a warning that anyone inciting or engaging in electoral violence \"at a time when abhorrent levels of violence already plague parts of the country\" is subject to prosecution, \"either by Nigerian Courts or by the ICC.\" \"No one should doubt my Office's resolve to prosecute individuals responsible for the commission of ICC crimes, whenever necessary,\" ICC Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said in the statement. Boko Haram attacks have killed at least 1,000 civilians so far this year, according to a Human Rights Watch (HRW) statement released Thursday. Citing interviews with witnesses, it said the militants rounded up 300 Gwoza residents when it overran the town, then took them to a camp in the Sambisa Forest. \"After five months during which other residents remained trapped on the hills, hiding in caves and weakened by hunger, Boko Haram attacked the civilians there, killing many and forcing others to escape over the border into Cameroon,\" the rights group said. \"Each week that passes we learn of more brutal Boko Haram abuses against civilians,\" said HRW researcher Mausi Segun, adding that Nigeria \"needs to make protecting civilians a priority in military operations against Boko Haram.\" The rights group said Nigerian security forces had \"failed to take all feasible precautions to protect the civilian population\" when fighting Boko Haram but noted that, according to the government, military police were investigating those claims. Amnesty International said in September that reports of alleged abuses by Nigerian security forces had increased since the government stepped up its fight against Boko Haram. The rights group alleged systemic use of torture by the police, based on hundreds of witness testimonies and other evidence gathered over a 10-year span. A spokesman for the Nigeria Police Force disputed the claims, saying torture and abuse were not \"repeat, not an official policy of the Nigeria Police\" and that the Amnesty report contained \"some blatant falsehoods.\" Earlier this month, ISIS purportedly said it welcomed Boko Haram after the latter pledged allegiance to it. In an audio message purportedly from an ISIS spokesman, the group announced that it had accepted a pledge of allegiance from Boko Haram. ISIS supporters posted the audio online. CNN cannot independently authenticate the 28-minute message. The message said that ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, had expanded to West Africa and congratulated \"our jihadi brothers\" there. It followed the posting online of an unauthenticated audio message purportedly from Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau, on March 9 in which the speaker announced that the terror group wanted to join ISIS. Since 2009, Boko Haram, whose name translates as \"Western education is sin,\" has waged a campaign of terror aimed at instituting a stricter version of Sharia law in Nigeria. Boko Haram's tactics have intensified in recent years, from battling Nigerian government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages, mass kidnappings, assassinations, market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques. Much of this violence has taken place in Nigeria. But neighboring countries, such as Cameroon and Chad, have also been hit increasingly hard and have committed troops to fight the militants. An African Union-mandated Multinational Joint Task Force has also been formed, involving troops from Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Benin as well as Nigeria. On Friday, the UK Foreign Office announced Britain would provide 5 million pounds ($7.4 million) to help the task force tackle Boko Haram. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond expressed hope that the United Nations Security Council would adopt a resolution, currently being negotiated, to endorse the task force.

{"article":"(CNN)There have been a few times in my career when I've been thoroughly disappointed -- even disgusted -- with my fellow women in the workplace. No, I certainly don't expect all my female colleagues to go out of their way for me and sing \"Kumbaya\" together in the office, but I'm always stunned when a woman who could have been helpful to me wasn't, when a woman who could have been a mentor chose not to be, when a woman tried to hurt me because of her own fear, anxiety or what have you. I'd love to say more about each of the women I've met along the way who fit those descriptions, but my point is not to single anyone out. My goal is to ask the question, \"Why?\" Obviously, not all women are like this and there are plenty of men guilty of the same behavior, but why do so many women try to tear each other down instead of lift each other up? I figured this would be a perfect question for Sophia Nelson, author of a new self-help book for women called \"The Woman Code,\" and she didn't disappoint. Unlocking 'The Woman Code': 4 tips to know your value . \"From the time we're little girls, we're taught to compete,\" said Nelson during a recent conversation at CNN. \"I need to be prettier, taller, smarter, my hair needs to be straighter, curlier, whatever it is. I need to get the better looking guy. I need to always be better than because we're taught to come from a place of lack as women.\" The way Nelson, an award-winning author and journalist, radio and television personality and motivational speaker, sees it, we women need to start operating like the boys. Men \"operate from a sense of, there's this whole pie, and I want my piece, and I don't care if he gets his piece, and maybe we even have to work together to start that business, start that company,\" said Nelson. Of course, it's easier for a man not to worry \"if he gets his piece\" since there are plenty of pieces of pie available for men in terms of management positions in corporate America, but that isn't the case for women. Today, just 5% of S&P 500 chief executives are women and only 14% of the top five senior leadership positions at those companies are held by women, according to a CNN Money analysis. Sheryl Sandberg teams up with NBA to get men to #LeanIn . Decades ago, the situation was even worse. When I was just starting my television news career in 1990, women who were in their 40s and were in high-level positions were the only women in a position of influence. Naturally, many of them often viewed other women as threats who could take their job. \"Because they didn't think there could be ten of them, they only thought there could be one of them,\" said Nelson. \"Fast forward 20 years later. Now there ... are a number of women partners at big firms, a number of women in Congress. I could keep going on and on so ... there is a place for more of us.\" Which means we can lift as we climb, we can help our younger sisters and even our cohorts while still moving up and on in our careers, says Nelson. \"How exactly do we do that?\" I had to ask. Nelson came armed with five tips on how women can work with as opposed to against each other. First, Nelson says be mindful of the people you surround yourself with and careful about \"who's in your row.\" \"If you hear another woman say, and I've heard this, 'I don't do women friends, I don't have women friends,' believe her and leave her alone. I mean that, listen to me now,\" said Nelson. There are too many women who believe in the sisterhood of women, so don't invest any time, if possible, with people who don't, she says. If you are in a meeting and you have a great idea, don't feel like you have to hoard it to yourself, said Nelson. \"Collaborate, share, collaborate. ... So you lift other women as you climb by collaborating versus competing.\" Competition is healthy and we can compete, but we ought to take a page from our male colleagues' playbook, she said. \"The guys collaborate better than we do because they operate from a place of 'I want the dollars. I want to win the contract. I want to get the business.' We have to get in that same mindset.\" We're all busy but we've got to slow down and mentor, said Nelson. \"We have to build a bench,\" she said. \"Men do this well again. You've seen it in corporate, I've seen it. The guys go out and golf. They do things together and they're building up the next young man leader. Whatever field we're in ... we're less likely to do it because we're busy. We've got to mentor.\" When you lift other women as you climb, said Nelson, you realize it's reciprocal. \"It's not all about you.\" We women win when more women are in executive roles in organizations, I added. \"The right women,\" said Nelson. \"I want to caveat that. And again, I don't mean to be mean or catty but ... I know a lot of women in power positions that don't help other women but there are a lot of women in power positions that do.\" This is a tough one for us, says Nelson. We need to be willing to say to another woman that we didn't like something she did or said and do it in a respectful and private way where we are still building her up, not pulling her down. \"Don't go tell 10 of your friends not to like her. You'd be amazed at how silly we can be. We're still in kindergarten some of us,\" said Nelson. \"Gossip is still one of the most rampant, nasty things we do as women to each other. And it hurts. It really damages women.\" Why do you think women too often tear each other down instead of help each other in the workplace? Share your thoughts with Kelly Wallace on Twitter @kellywallacetv or CNN Living on Facebook.","highlights":"CNN's Kelly Wallace wonders why women too often don't lift each up in the workplace .\nAuthor of \"The Woman Code\" says women need to start operating like the boys .\nWomen need to realize they win when they help other women get ahead, says author ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Britain's Prince Harry is preparing for a new chapter in his life. After nearly a decade with the British military, he has announced in a statement that he is leaving the armed forces. \"Moving on from the Army has been a really tough decision,\" he said in a statement released Tuesday. \"I consider myself incredibly lucky to have had the chance to do some very challenging jobs and have met many fantastic people in the process. ...[T]he experiences I have had over the last 10 years will stay with me for the rest of my life.\" \"Captain Harry Wales,\" as he is known, from his official title and name of His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales, began his formal military duties in 2005 at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.  The younger son of Prince Charles and Princess Diana seemed to thrive in a military setting.  He managed to curb his wild ways (for the most part), served two tours in Afghanistan and achieved the rank of captain in 2011.  He has also qualified as an Apache Aircraft commander. Prince Harry does have a few more responsibilities before he returns to civilian life. He'll spend the last two months of his operational service attached to Australian Defence Force units in Darwin, Perth and Sydney. \"We have prepared a challenging program that will see Captain Wales deploy on urban and field training exercises, domestic deployments, as well as participate in Indigenous engagement activities,\" said Air Chief Marshal Mark Binski of the Australian Defence Force. \"While all our units are highly capable, we have selected those units that best utilise Captain Wales' skill sets and give him some experience of the diverse range of capability we have within the ADF.\" Work with wounded soldiers will prepare the prince for the position he will take up in August. He will work in a volunteer capacity with the Ministry of Defence's Recovery Capability Programme and the London District Personnel Recovery Unit.  Both groups assist wounded or sick soldiers either return to duty or transition to civilian life. \"Wounded warriors\" are a special interest for Prince Harry.  He helped spearhead and continues to champion the Invictus Games, a competition for former military personnel who have been wounded in the line of duty. Prince Harry will still have royal duties to attend to while he is finishing his military service.  He will accompany Prince Charles on a trip to Turkey at the end of April, for commemorations marking the battle of Gallipoli. And he will undertake an official Royal tour of New Zealand in May, after his service with the Australian Defence Force is complete. \"This is a big, bold step for Prince Harry,\" said CNN Royal Correspondent Max Foster.  \"The military provided him with an escape from public life. He thrived being 'just one of the guys.'  But, as I understand it, he feels he's reached a natural crossroads in his career. The next steps would be staff college and desk jobs and that's not for him. He's passionate about the military, though, and I don't think will ever lose that connection.\"","highlights":"Statement: Prince Harry to leave military service in June .\nThe prince is set to continue work with wounded veterans ."}
{"article":"London (CNN)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his supporters are trying to create \"an atmosphere of hysteria\" and \"fear-mongering,\" the Iranian foreign minister said Thursday. \"The only explanation that you can have here is that some people consider peace and stability as an existential threat,\" Javad Zarif told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. \"Because a deal cannot be threatening to anybody unless you want conflict and tension and mistrust and crises.\" In a highly controversial speech to the U.S. Congress on Tuesday, Netanyahu said that far from stopping Iran, the deal currently being negotiated in Switzerland would pave Iran's way to nuclear weapons. Zarif told Amanpour that Netanyahu's speech had \"no effect on the negotiating table.\" He spoke from Montreux, Switzerland, where Iran, the U.S. and five other countries are trying to hammer out an agreement that would trade sanctions relief for guarantees on Iran's nuclear program. Zarif told Amanpour that he believed negotiators were \"very close\" to such a deal, but only if everybody avoided \"the path of confrontation.\" \"Everybody has to make tough choices. We have made the choice to engage in negotiations, although we believe that this entire exercise was unnecessary -- this was a manufactured crisis.\" \"People have been predicting for the past 20 years that Iran was a year away from making a bomb, and that prediction has been proven wrong time and again,\" Zarif said. \"But unfortunately that is a reality, that this hysteria that has been fanned continues to be fanned. And we try to resolve that problem.\" While the details of a definitive deal are still decidedly out of reach -- \"I'm not prepared to negotiate on the air\" -- Zarif told Amanpour that he had hope for a \"win-win situation for all.\" \"The object of this exercise is to ensure that Iran's nuclear program will always remain peaceful, and to remove all the restrictions that have been imposed on Iran, in our view unjustifiably,\" he said. \"You can either have sanctions and continue to seek that path of confrontation, or try to resolve this issue through negotiations and through an agreement.\" As Iran negotiates its nuclear future, a war against ISIS is being waged in neighboring Iraq. Tehran has supplied the Baghdad government with advisers, weapons, and ammunition, and one of its top generals, Qassim Sulaimani, has been sent to the country, according to the semiofficial Iranian FARS news agency. The Pentagon has suggested that Iranians could themselves be participating in the fight, which Zarif denied. \"We do not have forces on the ground in Iraq. We have always had advisers helping the Iraqi government and the Iraqi army,\" he said. \"We were the first to come to the assistance of the Iraqis, both in Baghdad as well as in Irbil, when the ISIS started moving in in massive numbers last summer.\" \"Everybody knows that without our assistance, things would have been different in Iraq,\" he added. \"We hope that this could unite Iraqis.\" The United States, which also has military advisers in Iraq and has launched an air campaign against ISIS, adamantly denies that it coordinates with Iran in the fight against their common enemy. \"This is a global threat,\" Zarif said. \"You see the implications in Europe, you see the fact that they are recruiting from Europe. So this is a global problem, it requires global cooperation and global work.\" Full transcript of Amanpour's interview with Foreign Minister Zarif.","highlights":"Netanyahu says a deal would open the way for Iran's nuclear weapons .\nIranian foreign minister says speech had \"no effect on the negotiating table\""}
{"article":"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN)At least six people have died and more than 60 were injured after the roof of a partially built cement factory collapsed Thursday in southwestern Bangladesh, police and fire officials told CNN. Many of those injured were in critical condition, said Mohammed Bakir Hossain, the top government physician of Bagerhat district. Mohammad Niazmur Rahman, the fire and civil defense official coordinating the search and rescue effort, said early Thursday evening that two people had been pulled alive from the rubble and as many as 30 others are believed to be still trapped. Deputy inspector general of police of Khulna range SM Monir Uz Zaman said the number of those still trapped was unclear \"as we're not sure how many people were working inside.\" The collapse took place around 1 p.m. (3 a.m. ET) in Mongla, a port city in the Asian nation's Bagerhat District. The factory is owned by Sena Kalyan Sangstha, a welfare organization for former Bangladeshi troops and their beneficiaries, according to Rahman and other local officials. Video from Boishakhi TV showed medical workers tending to the injured as they were wheeled into a local medical facility caked in dust. Deadly incidents at factories and other buildings, sadly, are nothing new in Bangladesh. The worst happened on April 24, 2013, when a nine-story building that housed five garment factories collapsed. Rescuers managed to save the lives of more than 2,400 people, but more than 1,100 died in the horrific accident. And a November 2012 apparel factory fire on Dhaka's outskirts killed at least 117 people, some of whom jumped from the building to escape the flames. Most of the dead were women, almost half of them burned so badly that DNA tests were needed to identify them. That blaze led to the convictions of 13 people for gross negligence of safety measures and spurred widespread criticism about the state of workers' rights in Bangladesh. The government responded by revamping laws so that workers no longer need approval from employers to form trade unions, and every factory that sells within the country also has to pledge 5% of their profits toward a workers' welfare fund. The government also boosted minimum wages from $38 to around $68 per month. Yet this hasn't stopped more deadly incidents, including the January deaths of at least 13 people when a fire broke out inside a Dhaka factory. Farid Ahmed reported from Dhaka and Harmeet Shah Singh from New Delhi. Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.

Carlo Ancelotti's side have hit a disappointing run of form after surrendering top spot in La Liga to rivals Barcelona following Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Athletic Bilbao having dropped two points six days earlier against Villarreal at the Bernabeu. Real still qualified for the Champions League quarter-finals despite Tuesday's defeat and Casillas is keen to look forward and stop the rot.

Speaking to Spanish sports paper\u00a0AS, Casillas said: 'We have hit rock bottom in a resounding way but the positive is that next week we play again and we can forget the last ten days. Because they have been ten dramatic days. The Spaniard, who suggested Madrid have a chance of turning things around when they face Barcelona a week on Friday, admits Real must improve if the club are to progress any further in the Champions League. 'We are not up to the standards we should be as Madrid and the quarter-finals of the Champions League,' said the 33-year-old.

The Florida couple and their two dogs were still there Thursday morning,  more than 14 hours later, unable to get back to the Sunshine State. \"We're just sitting here praying, hoping to get out,\" Patrick Kilgallon told CNN on Thursday. They were among hundreds of motorists who had been stranded on I-65 near Elizabethtown, Kentucky, and on Interstate 24 near Paducah after a storm so intense that road crews just couldn't keep up. Gov. Steve Beshear said Thursday afternoon that some traffic had begun to inch along. \"We have finally cleared some emergency lanes on the sides of the roads, and the traffic now northbound on I-65 is beginning to move slowly and to clear out,\" he told CNN. \"It will take several hours to clear it out, because it's backed up so much. But it is moving again, thank goodness.\" Video shot from news helicopters above the interstate showed that by 4 p.m., cars and many tractor-trailers were rolling along, once they cleared a hill near Elizabethtown. But in some places, the vehicles that still had gas had to maneuver around those that didn't. And Thursday evening, traffic was still at a standstill in Hart County between mile markers 71 and 74, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet said. The Kentucky National Guard was helping motorists, taking some to nearby warming centers and returning others to their cars where the highways were passable, Lt. Col. Kirk Hilbrecht told CNN. 94 million Americans say: 'Enough with winter, already' Beshear told CNN that officials had been prepared. \"We did everything we could in advance,\" he said. There were no reports of any deaths or major injuries, the governor said. \"I-65 was literally a parking lot for 15 hours,\" said Rev. Janette Wilson, who was stuck on the highway while headed from Chicago to Selma, Alabama. \"The thing that troubles me the most was the lack of preparedness for the storm and the inability of the Kentucky emergency response team to investigate ... the impact on people on the road.\" No one checked whether people had run out of food or gas, or gave those stranded an update, she told CNN's Anderson Cooper. Wilson said they were stuck on the road and not moving between 2:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. A morning weather report indicated that over a 15-hour span, 21 inches of snow had fallen on Elizabethtown, about 50 miles south of Louisville. Other parts of Kentucky, along with parts of Ohio to the north and Tennessee to the south, had more than a foot of snow. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet published a hotline number for motorists stranded on the highway. The Kilgallons gassed up Wednesday night and tried to beat the storm as they traveled south for Florida. But 25 miles from Louisville, they hit \"nothing but dead stop\" on I-65. Kilgallon has a scanner in the car and said she has heard that a tractor-trailer collided with several cars, and while the truck was moved, there were not enough tow trucks to move the other vehicles involved in the accident. The Kilgallons had a few snacks left and are rationing the water they have left, Patrick Kilgallon said Thursday afternoon. They ran the engine on their new Jeep all night to keep warm and prevent the ice from encrusting the car too deeply, he said. Asked whether she was upset with Kentucky officials, Sue Ellen Kilgallon said no. \"I think they're doing the best they can,\" she said. \"I'd cry if it weren't so amusing.\" CNN's Steve Almasy, Chuck Johnston, Brandon Miller and Carol Costello contributed to this report.","highlights":"Some motorists still stuck on interstate .\nKentucky governor says state officials did everything they could in advance .\nMotorists also had been stranded on Interstate 24 near Paducah, Kentucky ."}

{"article":"Andy Cole has revealed how he was made to feel 'small' by a perceived snub from Teddy Sheringham that led to the England pair not talking. The former Manchester United striker played alongside Sheringham at Old Trafford for four years but did not enjoy a relationship with his compatriot following an incident on international duty. Cole made his England debut from the bench in a 0-0 friendly draw with Uruguay in 1995 and, in replacing then-Tottenham forward Sheringham, felt the lack of acknowledgement from his future United team-mate was disrespectful. Andy Cole (right) played alongside Teddy Sheringham at Manchester United for four years - but the pair never got on following a perceived snub from Sheringham during an England international in 1995 . Sheringham - and David Beckham - congratulate Cole after scoring in a 6-0 win over Bradford City in 2000 . 'From my England debut against Uruguay, he was going to be substituted for me to come on to replace him, and he snubbed me on the line,' Cole said. 'I just thought to myself, 'I'm making my debut here and Wembley is a packed house'. And I felt so small. 'I don't think his apology would come, because I honestly do believe that he believes he was not in the wrong.' Despite a fantastic goalscoring record at club level, Cole only made 15 international appearances and scored just once - famously calling former England boss Glenn Hoddle a 'coward' for announcing he was dropping Cole through the press. 'I don't think it was damaging to my career,' Cole said of his remarks. 'I just think a lot of the media and a lot of Joe Public picked up on that and ran with it and ran with it, and exhausted it. And I remember when it came out, I mean of course it was going to be massive news. He was the England manager.' Cole and Sheringham celebrate on the pitch in 2000 but the didn't speak off it . The pair come face-to-face when Cole played for Manchester City and Sheringham at West Ham in 2005 . Despite a prolific goalscoring record at club level, Cole won just 15 caps for England . Kevin Keegan and Cole, pictured here on international duty, fell out briefly in October 1993 . Cole also had a high-profile falling out with Kevin Keegan in 1993 while at Newcastle, something the striker said was a consequence of tiredness more than anything else. 'I felt so tired, and I couldn't get myself going,' Cole told ITV, 'He [Keegan] said, 'Don't you fancy it today?' So I said to him, 'No I don't fancy it today.' So he said, 'Well if you don't fancy it you can do one.' So I said, 'Okay, not a problem to me,' and I just walked off. 'I got in a taxi and my girlfriend then, she was at home so I just ended up going to hers. And I remember I rang the doorbell and she said to me, 'What are you doing here, you've got a game tonight haven't you?' 'I said I just walked out of there, I couldn't be bothered.' Keegan added: 'We went to play the game, no Andy Cole and we lost, and we go in Friday for training, we've got a game on Saturday. Andy poked his head round [the door] and he just said, \"Gaffer, what do I do now?\" I said, \"I'll tell you what to do, you go out, you train properly and if I think you are fit enough I will put you in the team tomorrow.\"' Andy Cole: Sports Life Stories - ITV4 10pm on\u00a0Tuesday March 10)","highlights":"Cole says Sheringham made him feel 'small' after snub on England debut .\nIncident happened when Cole made debut for country at Wembley in 1995 .\nPair played together for Man United but didn't speak off the field .\nCole made just 15 appearances for England despite prolific club form ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Prince William arrived in Beijing on Sunday -- the first visit to China by a senior member of the British Royal Family in  three decades -- and he might have been expecting a dose of culture shock. But chances are he'll feel right at home. From television shows and etiquette lessons to private schools and mock Tudor housing developments, China has been embracing British culture with a passion. Chinese viewers are captivated in their millions by shows like \"Sherlock Holmes\" and \"Downton Abbey,\" with the former's star, Benedict Cumberbatch, so popular he has his own Chinese nickname -- Curly Blessing. The fascination with Edwardian England depicted in Downton has created a growing demand for butlers, and the country's elite are donning tweeds and taking up deer stalking. \"Downton Abbey depicts traditional British, high-class lives. It something that I and many other Chinese are curious about,\" said student Cherrie Zhang. It's not just television shows. Affluent Chinese parents are sending their children to British schools after some of the most notable names in British education have established campuses in China. Harrow, Wellington College and Dulwich College have all opened sister schools in the country. And the obsession with British culture has taken a bizarre turn in Thames Town, a housing development on the outskirts of Shanghai that resembles a quaint English town, complete with replica red telephone booths. It's crucial that Prince William capitalizes on these cultural ties during his high-profile visit, which is being viewed as the first real test of his diplomatic skills. \"It will tell us something about how he will handle one of the most important diplomatic relationships when he comes to throne,\" said Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Sydney and a former British diplomat. \"And I think China will put some capital in his visit because this guy is not a politician, who come and go, but (someone who) will be around for quite a while.\" Cultural exports are viewed as a growth area that the prince can promote. China spent 17 million pounds on UK TV programs and formats in 2013, a 40% increase on the year before, but they form a small part of the overall trade balance. And while London has been successful in attracting Chinese investment, UK companies have not thrived in China the same way as some of their U.S. and German counterparts. Previous trips by Royals have been gaffe ridden. When the Queen and Prince Philip spent time in China in 1986, the Queen's husband caused offense when he told a group of British students: \"If you stay here much longer, you'll all be slitty-eyed.\" Prince Charles, William's father, has never visited China but described the country's leaders as \"appalling old waxworks\" during his visit to Hong Kong in 1997. His close ties with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, have also angered China's leaders. Prince William will visit Beijing's Forbidden City, attend the Chinese premiere of the British-produced children's animated movie \"Paddington\" in Shanghai and launch a campaign to celebrate British innovation during the three-day trip. Before China, he is spending three days in Japan. The prince will also get a chance to champion one of his favorite causes -- combating the illegal trade in wildlife --  when he visits an elephant sanctuary in southwestern China . \"If he can make some kind of link in China, if he can instinctively show he gets it, that could be an important thing,\" Brown said. But the relationship between the UK and China comes laden with \"stacks of historic baggage,\" Brown adds, and the prince will have to tread carefully, particularly over the former colony of Hong Kong, where the push for a free vote has strained ties between Britain and China, the current landlords. British lawmakers were denied permission to visit the city on a \"fact-finding\" mission last year amid heated pro-democracy protests. What's more, it's not clear how much \"star power\" Prince William has in China, especially without his glamorous wife Kate, who at eight months pregnant won't make the trip, and his young son George. An informal survey conducted by the UK's Telegraph newspaper in Beijing showed that many struggled to recognize the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge -- one thought the couple were in the movie \"Titanic\" -- and there are fears his visit will struggle to attract interest among ordinary Chinese. \"The Royal Family are not really a big deal to me,\" said Zhang, the Downton Abbey fan. Serena Dong in Beijing contributed to this report .","highlights":"Prince William arrives in China on Sunday after visiting Japan .\nChina has embraced British culture, especially TV shows like \"Downton Abbey\"\nTrip presents diplomatic test for Prince William ."}
{"article":"Manor  had no intention of competing at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix and will pay a price for their failure to race, Formula One's ringmaster Bernie Ecclestone indicated on Monday. The struggling British-based team, who emerged from the remains of the failed Marussia outfit after going into administration and missing the last three races of 2014, failed to turn a wheel on the track in Melbourne. They missed all three practice sessions and Saturday qualifying, blaming software problems, which ruled them out of the race. Manor mechanics work on their car in Melbourne, but they failed to take part at any point over the weekend . British driver Will Stevens has been named one of Manor's drivers this term, and Graeme Lowdon (right) However, they escaped punishment with stewards deciding to take no action after an enquiry decided the team had made 'all reasonable endeavours' to get their cars ready. 'We should have never ever, ever allowed Manor to do what they've done. It's our fault. I predicted this would happen,' Ecclestone said. 'They had no intention of racing in Australia. Zero. They couldn't have raced if someone had gone there with a machine gun and put it to their head. 'It was impossible. So they had no intention. We'll have to see now. And they will have to pay their way to get there and get out of there,' he added. Bernie Ecclestone has indicated that Manor will pay the price for their no-show at the season opener . Marussia, who were ninth overall last season thanks to a ninth-place finish by Frenchman Jules Bianchi in Monaco, won a race against time to get their cars through crash tests and onto the air charter for Australia. Ecclestone said there had been no charge for the freight because they were entitled to that providing they were competing. 'They are not competing so they have to pay for that,' he added. The team are in line for some \u00a328million of revenues from last season but would have forfeited the right to that if they had not turned up to compete in Australia with cars that satisfied the regulations. 'We knew we had the possibility of unknown problems and we haven't had the benefit of sorting some of those problems out in pre-season testing,' sporting director Graeme Lowdon said. 'But equally we had to come here on the basis that we're racing so we brought all of our normal equipment. There's 28 tonnes of equipment to support these cars and all of the staff.

{"article":"Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara pointed the finger of blame at ref Craig Thomson after Paul Paton was sent off in an apparent case of mistaken identity during a stormy 1-1 draw with Celtic in the Scottish Cup. Paton was astonished to be shown a red card along with Virgil van Dijk after the Dutchman and Calum Butcher clashed on the ground following a poor tackle by Celtic captain Scott Brown on Nadir Ciftci \u2013 who appeared to kick Brown\u2019s head in retaliation. McNamara vowed to appeal in a bid to clear Paton for next Sunday\u2019s League Cup final against Ronny Deila\u2019s men at Hampden, and it remains to be seen whether SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan will take retrospective action against Butcher, Ciftci or Brown, with TV pictures indicating they could all have seen red. Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara wasn't impressed with referee Craig Thomson's performance . Paul Paton was sent off in an apparent case of mistaken identity during a stormy 1-1 draw with Celtic . But the United boss claimed that, had the match official sent off Brown for the initial challenge, the ensuing melee and embarrassing card blunder would have been avoided. \u2018I think we will be appealing,\u2019 said McNamara, whose team were reduced to nine men in the second half when Paul Dixon was sent off for handling the ball in the box. \u2018Paul Paton feels a bit hard done to for being sent off for nothing. He wasn\u2019t even involved in the incident. But I think the ref should have dealt with the original bad challenge (from Brown) that sparked the whole thing off. But that went unnoticed. It was a two-footed challenge off the deck. It was a bad onebut it didn\u2019t get dealt with properly. \u2018We should be talking about the football rather than the ugly scenes. But, for me, the officials should have dealt with it first and we would not have had the problems we had today.\u2019 Asked if he expects Brown to be hit with disciplinary action from the SFA, McNamara replied: \u2018No comment.\u2019 Ciftci scored United\u2019s opener on the stroke of half time after Aiden Connolly appeared to go down easily in the box, with Celtic boss Deila later insisting the player should be punished for diving. Three minutes after the break, United\u2019s Dixon was dismissed for blocking a goal-bound drive by Leigh Griffiths but the striker\u2019s penalty was saved by keeper Radoslaw Cierzniak. Thomson ended up sending three players off, and United will appeal the red card of Paton . Griffiths had the last laugh, however, with a headed equaliser in the 71st minute to take the match to a replay at Parkhead on March 18. Ciftci was lucky to still be on the park after kicking out at Brown but McNamara claimed not to have seen the incident. \u2018I need to see it. I haven\u2019t looked back at the TV footage. And when Nadir gets tackled by Brown, the ball breaks and Butcher wins the challenge to put us through and I was looking at that next bit of play. I did not see what happened with van Dijk, Butcher or anyone else. I actually didn\u2019t know the ref had got the wrong man until Paton came over and told me. It was a melee but the ref did not deal with the original bad challenge which sparked it all off.\u2019 McNamara, whose side will now face Celtic four times in March, also defended young striker Connolly. \u2018I don\u2019t think he dived,\u2019 he said. \u2018I think he (Anthony Stokes) has caught him although he hasn\u2019t caught him on the leg. It might have been soft but it was a penalty.\u2019 McNamara had no complaints about the spot-kick award and red card when Dixon handled a shot by Griffiths. \u2018Rules are rules but Rado made a great save. He didn\u2019t deserve to lose a goal today. But we switched off for one moment and Griffiths peels off and scores a header. \u2018We can take certain things from today\u2019s game but Celtic will be saying the same. Cool heads will be needed for the final next week. The disciplinary side needs to be better. \u2018It\u2019s a chance for silverware and for the lads to create a bit of history. Will I be sick of the sight of Celtic by the end of our four games this month? Not if we beat them.\u2019","highlights":"Paul Paton was sent off in a case of mistaken identity .\nDundee United's Calum Butcher had tangled with Celtic's Virgil van Dijk .\nJackie McNamara vowed to appeal the sending off to clear Paton's name ."}

{"article":"Former England spinner Graeme Swann has called on the England and Wales Cricket Board to realise their approach is 'out of date', saying that there is a 'stubbornness' about their selection policy and that they are 'living in the past'. Swann watched on as England slumped to another heavy World Cup loss, with Sri Lanka chasing down their 309 for six with ease, winning with nine wickets and 16 balls to spare. The defeat goes alongside reverses against Australia and New Zealand, with Scotland the only team England have beaten so far. VIDEO Scroll down to watch\u00a0Cricket World Cup Highlights: England vs Sri Lanka . Former England spinner Graeme Swann (pictured in 2013) has hit out at the England and Wales Cricket Board . Wins over Afghanistan and Bangladesh would take them to the quarter-finals, but Swann thinks the problems are evident. Writing on Twitter, he said: 'A positive thing that can come of this world cup is that maybe the top brass will realise just how out of date our approach is.' Swann also aired his views on BBC Radio 5 Live, adding that England had been overly pleased to get what he considered to be an average score. 'I think the problem lies not just with the bowling but the whole approach. It was a very self-congratulatory 310, everyone was saying 'brilliant'. These days that's about average and not a great score,' he said. 'We should be looking for 340, 350; The difference between the top teams and everyone else is immense. They're saying the is the limit when you bat, we're still looking at par scores.' Swann feels the answer could lie with former Nottinghamshire team-mate Alex Hales. 'There's a bit of stubbornness about the selection policy,' he added. 'I like Gary Ballance, he's a great lad, but I think even he'd admit that he shouldn't be in the team at the minute, he's in horrible form. 'We have a lad in Alex Hales, one of these new generation players who does go out and knock it about, he tries to smash everything for four and six. 'We need to get these young lads playing. We have too many people running it, too many people involved, too many plans and I think we're just living in the past.'

Another ex-England player, Geoffrey Boycott, said the England team were not being realistic. Boycott has long spoken his mind about the national team's woes, and though he conceded to some positives, he sees plenty of work to be done. He told BBC 5 Live: 'I do think we could have got another 20-odd runs, there was a period where we were just cantering around. We are not a force to be reckoned with at all. 'The batting was quite good, but the bowling? No, no, sorry. It wasn't very challenging. 'They're not bad players, we don't have a bad side at all. But we're not firing on all cylinders in any department whatsoever. 'The sad thing for me, even Joe Root, (he gave) a nice interview, lovely lad, but there's no realism.

{"article":"(CNN)December 16, 2014 was a dark day, not just in our nation's history, but the world's. Young innocent children were brutally massacred in a school in Peshawar along with their teachers. It shook a nation that had already seen more than 55,000 of its innocent civilians die in the hands of terrorism in the last 10 years, to a whole new level. Naturally, I was in no less despair. Hailing from a humble background, where both my parents have served in the field of education their entire lives, the strong emphasis on education in our house was probably another reason why this incident had affected me so deeply. READ MORE: Bloodstains, bullet holes mark Peshawar classrooms . I canceled my tours and concerts and couldn't gather myself to do much in coming weeks. However, being an artist, I had to express myself; even more so because I have always believed that an artist should be more than a tool for his art to resonate through. He must also resonate the voice of his surroundings by being socially aware and strive to contribute to his environment for the better in whatever little or large manner that he decides for himself. I thought that each one of us needed to wake up to this call and help and inspire the other to do more for our future. So I picked up the phone and started calling all my colleagues from film, fashion, TV and music. I was pleasantly surprised that all of them agreed with my initiative and came on board without a second thought on such a short notice. We all got together because we all want a progressive, peaceful, tolerant and positive Pakistan. And the response to the song and video further solidified my belief that every Pakistani wants the same. They just need someone to show them the way. And to me, education is the way forward. It's the the key to progress and peace. I also feel that there is a lot more to Pakistan than what the world gets to see. Pakistan is a beautiful land with beautiful people who -- like those in any other nation -- want to live in harmony with themselves and the world. A place where people sing, dance and play. Unfortunately because of an extremist minority, it is sometimes seen as an extremist country. But no society is void of extremism in one way or the other. This is something that we all need to work towards -- the international community and us. Pakistan needs your help. It has been fighting this battle for years and lost countless lives in the process. Its economy has also suffered. The world needs to see Pakistan in a whole different light to help us out of this darkness. They need to partner with us towards progress. They need to understand the complexities of this society and the fact that it's not easy to survive through all that this country has been through. Today the entire nation stands as one for this cause. And that is what I have tried to show the world in this video. A Pakistan that stands united to make sure that the lives of those innocent children did not go to waste. I also didn't want this to be just a song. I wanted to practically help towards a cause dear to me -- education. So, I collaborated with a leading Pakistani educational non-profit organization, The Citizens Foundation (TCF) and 141schools.org (141 SCHOOLS), a new citizen web movement. Together, they are building 141 schools across Pakistan. Each school will be dedicated to the children and teachers who lost their lives in attack on December 16, 2014. All proceeds from the downloads of the song will go towards building schools for the children of Pakistan and ensuring a bright future. I aspire to build at least one school which would cost around 20.7 million pkr ($202,900).

{"article":"(CNN)A  Palestinian man rammed into a cyclist and four Israeli border police while he was driving in Jerusalem on Friday, authorities and first responders said. Witnesses said the man drove off the side of the road to hit his victims. They were taken to the hospital with light to moderate injuries. Authorities are treating the incident as a terror attack, according to police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld. The suspect tried to escape, but was shot by a security guard and severely wounded before being taken into custody, police said.

{"article":"(CNN)The next time the people of Capracotta, Italy, hear the folks in Boston complain about a snow season of more than 100 inches, they'll be like: \"That's nice. We've been known to get that much in one day.\" In 18 hours, actually. It's not an official record yet, but it looks like the Italian village got 100.8 inches (256 centimeters) on Thursday, setting the all-time mark for most snow in 24 hours. Pescocostanzo, about 21 miles (34.6 kilometers) away, only got 94.5 inches (240 cm). That's more than Boston got in January and February combined, but just short of the 105.7 inches the city totaled so far for the whole season. One of the photos posted on MeteoWeb, the Italian weather website that reported the immense snowfall, showed a resident standing on top of the accumulation shaking hands with a neighbor. She is in a second-story window. The town, which has about 1,000 residents and sits at an altitude of 4,662 feet (1,421 meters), is prone to heavy one-day snowfalls, MeteoWeb reported. You might conclude it's in the Italian Alps given all that snow, but that's not the case. It's about a three-hour drive east of Rome, roughly halfway down the Italian Peninsula, not far from the Adriatic Sea. But it is in the mountains and is vulnerable to weather coming from the northeast. The World Meteorological Organization will confirm whether the snowfall actually surpassed the 24-hour snowfall record -- 75.8 inches -- from Silver Lake, Colorado, set in 1921. MeteoWeb reported that the snow fell in 18 hours and that in unpopulated areas at higher altitudes, it is likely accumulations were much more significant.

{"article":"(CNN)A chiseled boxer's Instagram feed shows him making constant references to the Bible and enjoying gospel singing with his wife. Another features his formidable opponent counting stacks of money, hanging out in strip clubs, and flashing diamond watches and Ferraris. Welcome to the world of boxing promotion, circa 2015. American Floyd Mayweather and Filipino Manny Pacquiao are set to officially announce their heavily anticipated boxing match at a press conference in Los Angeles Wednesday. With the combined purse for the May 2 bout in Las Vegas reported to touch $300 million pending viewership numbers, the incentives to self-promote could not be higher. \"Nowadays you have to be on social media to launch the fight and to build hype,\" says boxing promoter Nisse Sauerland, CEO of Team Sauerland. \"It couldn't be done without it.\" Thirty-eight year old Mayweather (47-0, 26 knockouts), who favors the moniker \"The Money Man\" or \"TBE\" (The Best Ever), boasts nearly five million Instagram followers, 5.65 million followers on Twitter and 9.2 million Facebook likes. He famously confirmed the fight via Shots, a photo sharing social media application that he's invested in, and displays links to his clothing brand, The Money Team, on all his accounts. Along with professing to the be the best fighter of all time, he could also stake a claim to be one of the greatest social media users in sports. \"I think they're both playing their roles,\" says Sauerland, who promotes over 45 boxers. \"You've got the bad guy and the good guy, really. You've got the guy who throws the money around (Mayweather), that's his image, and Pacquiao, he's the hope of a nation.\" Although Pacquiao (57-5-2, 38 knockouts) also sports millions of followers, his social media numbers lag behind that of his opponent. The 36-year-old Filipino counts 1.7 million followers on Twitter and just 647,000 on Instagram, although his popularity on Facebook is much closer, with 6.3 million page likes. Has this disparity had an impact on Pacquiao's share of the fight's heady purse, which is reported to be split 60\/40 in favor of Mayweather? \"If you have five million Twitter followers it does give you power in negotiation, because it reflects popularity, \" says Sauerland. \"But Mayweather needs Pacquiao too; you need  a storyline to make a good fight ... (Pacquiao) is the route to make it the biggest purse in history.\" The disparity is probably due to Pacquiao's less flashy posts. Without exception, they show him in training, in church, or with family -- always with a nod to Jesus in the text -- as well as his nationality, says sports media consultant Daniel McLaren and Cast Digital chief executive officer. \"Manny is a little bit more of a private person; he's not going to be as outspoken and give away as much, so he's always going to have a smaller following,\" he says, while noting that Instagram is less popular outside of North America and Europe. Pacquiao's followers in his home country are more likely to track his moves on Facebook and Twitter, adds McLaren. Either way, both fighters are likely to experience a surge in followers. \"If the only place you can find out what's happening behind the scenes in the lead-up to the fight is via their social media feeds, you're going to follow them,\" McLaren says. \"So I think they will see quite a big increase in followers and the amount of mentions they're getting as the fight gets closer.\" Athletes who participate in individual sports are more inclined to be active on social media, says McLaren, because they don't receive regular salaries, and product endorsements can be a much larger portion of their income. \"A boxer or a golfer or a tennis player has to use it as a commercial platform or a brand building platform,\" he says. \"If you have the choice between a different number of athletes to sponsor, and one has a million Instagram followers while the other doesn't go on social media, then it's a no-brainer.\" Sauerland agrees. \"Every fighter nowadays should be on social media, and if they're not, then they're not doing a good enough job at promoting themselves,\" he says. \"It doesn't matter who you are, whether you're a club fighter or a superstar.\" \"It'll be an interesting fight,\" adds McLaren, \"just because they are so different.\"","highlights":"Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao bout set to be the largest purse in boxing history .\nFighters take to social media to boost  viewership .\nInstagram accounts highlight personality clash ."}
{"article":"Daniel Vettori became the 12th player to take 300 one-day international wickets as New Zealand eased to a six-wicket victory against Afghanistan. The 36-year-old, who took an impressive 4-18, is the first New Zealander to pass the landmark and now sits in the esteemed company of greats such as Muttiah Muralitharan, Wasim Akram and Glenn McGrath. Afghanistan required a seventh-wicket partnership of 86 between Najibullah Zadran and Samiullah Shenwari to post a respectable 186 all out, having chosen to bat, but a 19-ball 42 from Brendon McCullum ensured there would be no shock in Napier. Daniel Vettori became the 12th player to take 300 one-day international wickets . Vettori of New Zealand celebrates taking the wicket of Afsar Zazai of  Afghanistan at the Cricket World Cup . Vettori  celebrates with Brendon McCullum after taking the wicket of Zazai  during the Cricket World Cup match . Perhaps a mark of the man and an added insight into the where the focus of the team remains, Vettori said the landmark was something he would think about after the World Cup. 'Right now we are caught up in the middle of a World Cup,' he said. 'We have an important game on Friday (group game against Bangladesh), and then probably the most important of our careers the following Saturday (quarter-final). 'Maybe in a month, it will be the time to look back on it. I didn't go into the World Cup thinking about that milestone, I didn't believe I would take this many wickets in this few games.' Understandably stung from being smashed for a record-breaking 417 runs by Australia in Perth days earlier, Mohammad Nabi chose to bat after calling correctly at the toss. Afghanistan were made to pay for a choice that signaled a slight naivety within the camp, with their own coaching staff having previously admitted that bowling was the side's strong suit. The newcomers to the World Cup stage collapsed to 34-3 and then 59-6, as Vettori caused most of the damage after Trent Boult had Javed Ahmadi trapped lbw for just one. McCullum has developed into an imposing captain, known for his ingenuity and outrageously attacking fields \u2013 so his decision to bowl his spinner in just the third over was met with mild surprise. The decision was less genius and more to allow New Zealand's opening bowlers, Tim Southee and Boult, to switch ends. The 36-year-old is the first New Zealander to pass the landmark of 300 ODI wickets . New Zealand eased to a six-wicket win over Afghanistan at the Cricket World Cup on Sunday . He now sits in the company of greats such as Muttiah Muralitharan, Wasim Akram and Glenn McGrath . Vettori of New Zealand speaks at a post-match press conference following their Cricket World Cup win . Still, Vettori showed that he's as accurate in the third over as in the 15th as he struck with his first ball. Usman Ghani lost sight of the ball and saw his off stump disturbed. With his opening strike bowlers having switched ends, McCullum resumed the pace attack, and Asghar Stanikzai could only send a short ball from Boult into the geelful clutches of Martin Guptil. Southee, struggling with his line and length, was replaced by Vettori, who took No.300 by bowling Nawroz Mangal for 27 with the first ball of his third over. The Auckland-born spinner was on a roll and had Nabi (6) and Afsar Zazai dismissed off consecutive balls. Nabi was caught at slip, while Zazai was trapped leg before. That brought Najibullah to the crease for the hat-trick ball, and the batsman was welcomed by the sight of nine men around his bat, with no fielder outside the circle. However, he survived and showed maturity beyond his years in his partnership with Shenwari before departing after a run-a-ball 56 that ended when he top-edged a short and wide bouncer from Adam Milne to Vettori at third man. New Zealand's Ross Taylor gets a handshake from Afghanistan's Hamid Hassan (left) after the match . New Zealand are very much on course to end their World Cup victory drought . Shenwari, undoubtedly Afghanistan's best batsman in this tournament, was the anchor of his side's innings, and he made 54 off 110 balls before falling to Corey Anderson. An entertaining cameo from Hamid Hassan (16 off 21) took Afghanistan to 186, but for the fifth consecutive World Cup match New Zealand bowled out their opposition. The number of orange target T-shirts seemed to double after the resumption of play with the crowd undoubtedly expecting McCullum to send a few balls into the stand and help them earn a share of the pot of money for the 'one-handed crowd catch' promotion. But McCullum cleared the rope just once in his innings before being bowled by Nabi with one that kept a touch low. His departure unsurprisingly slowed the run chase, and when Kane Williamson picked out midwicket off Shapoor Zardan for 33, the Afghans believed they had a chance. Two comical run-outs saw Martin Guptill (57) and Grant Elliott (19) further add to the nerves of the McLean Park crowd, but Ross Taylor, the birthday boy, held his nerve to steer New Zealand home. The same side, the same outcome, the same feeling after the match \u2013 New Zealand are very much on course to end their World Cup victory drought.","highlights":"Daniel Vettori became just the 12th player to take 300 ODI wickets .\nThe 36-year-old is the first New Zealander to pass the landmark .\nHe took 4-18 to earn his place among greats such as Muttiah Muralitharan .\nNew Zealand eased to a six-wicket victory over Afghanistan in Napier ."}
{"article":"Thomas Aiken may not be defending his title, but South African players will look to maintain their stranglehold on the Africa Open in East London this week. England's Andy Sullivan is favourite to spoil their plans after winning the Joburg Open last Sunday, the 27-year-old claiming his second European Tour title in South Africa in the space of eight weeks. But home players have won the event every year since it began in 2010, with former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel winning the inaugural event and being followed into the winners' circle by fellow major winner Louis Oosthuizen (twice), Darren Fichardt and Aiken. Andy Sullivan  in action during the pro-am ahead of the Africa Open at East London Golf Club . European Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke hits an approach shot in practice ahead of the tournament . Aiken's win 12 months ago helped him top the Sunshine Tour Order of Merit and secure a place in the field for the WGC-Cadillac Championship, which is also being staged this week at Doral. That leaves the likes of Fichardt and George Coetzee to lead the home challenge, with Coetzee keen to keep the trophy in South African hands. 'It was my first time playing (in 2010) and it was a big deal to see all the foreign players pull into East London,' said Coetzee, who finished 24th in the defence of his Joburg Open last week. 'Since then the Africa Open always attracts a strong contingent of local and international players. The crowds are always fantastic, because they are lively but very neutral. They just want to watch some great golf and they cheer for everyone. It's fun to play in front of galleries like that. 'Personally, I would very much like to put my name below Thomas' on the trophy before the international players have their day.' Matthew Baldwin of England tees off on the fifth hole  during practice at the stunning East London Golf Club . European Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke is a notable name in the field but it is Sullivan, however, who looks most likely to gatecrash the home party. 'I think if I did I'd become one of the most hated people down here, so I'm not sure if I want to win this week,' Sullivan joked. 'But obviously it would be great to get a victory down here as well. 'It's quite hard because we go from week to week so it still has not sunk in yet. I am on the crest of a wave and just want to keep riding it and hopefully keep going this week. I'm looking forward to the task at hand, I think the wind is going to keep the scoring pretty fair and it should be fun. A buck crosses the fairway as home player Trevor Fisher jnr plays a shot . Thankfully for Graeme Storm the bucks stop with him able to hit his drive during the pro-am . 'It's a hell of a lot different to last week where we were just hitting the ball straight up in the air, it could be a massive change to what we are used to but I've had a couple of days in the wind now to get used to it and a feel for the course. We are professional golfers for a reason, we should be able to adapt.' Four of the players who finished runner-up to Sullivan last week - David Howell, Jaco van Zyl, Wallie Coetsee and Kevin Phelan - are in the field at East London, along with Oliver Fisher, who lost out in a play-off to Aiken 12 months ago. 'I have fond memories of the place, it was a good week last year and hopefully I can have a good week again,' Fisher said. 'Last year I started well here to set the season off on a good tone and it's always nice to get off to a good start.'","highlights":"Andy Sullivan is favourite to win Africa Open this week .\nEnglishman has won twice on the European Tour in eight weeks .\nBut South Africans have claimed top prize every year since event began ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Vladimir Putin is not a self-effacing man. That's why when the Russian president suddenly disappeared from view people took notice. When Russian officials tried to trick the public by passing off old photos as new appearances, speculation about Putin's whereabouts went viral. Hashtags such as #Whereisputin and #\u041f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0423\u043c\u0435\u0440 -- Russian for #PutinIsDead -- became the tip of a giant social media iceberg, much of it streaked with dark humor. In Ukraine, the neighboring state besieged by Putin's forces, someone reportedly left a large funeral wreath at the gate of the Russian embassy.  A handwritten message addressed Putin with an expletive, telling him, \"Thank you for croaking.\" The fast-moving iceberg of speculation may melt as fast as it emerged. The Kremlin has now started pushing harder against the rumors, trying to prove that Russia's foremost -- nay, only -- major political leader, is alive and well. Early on Friday, officials released what they said was a picture of Putin taken the day of. But on social media, onlookers accused officials of dusting off old images. Those keeping track insist Putin has not been seen since March 5. Regardless of how or when this speculation ends, it tells us much about the political realities of Russia. This whole thing started after Putin's trip to Kazakhstan was canceled on Wednesday and a Kazakh official told a reporter that the Russian President had fallen ill. Then the Kremlin released a picture of Putin speaking with the leader of the Republic of Karelia. But it turns out that happened on March 4. On Thursday, Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the President would miss his regular meeting with the Federal Security Service (FSB). When asked about his boss's health, Peskov said he is \"absolutely healthy,\" his handshake so strong he could \"break your hand.\" To illustrate the point, the Kremlin's Russia Today posted a picture of the mighty President slamming a judo opponent hard against the ground. Peskov says Russia is in the grips of a \"spring fever\" that is causing people to dream up harebrained scenarios. Amateur sleuths and creative minds have speculated wildly about Putin's health problems. The Swiss magazine Blick said Putin is in Lugano, where his girlfriend just gave birth to their baby. Some have said he has cancer; others report a heart attack or a stroke. There are even suggestions that he went off to join ISIS, or is playing hide-and-seek a la Where's Waldo. Does Putin ever catch a cold? Does he ever get sick? The Kremlin doesn't want to allow Putin's image of virility and strength to become tarnished by the weaknesses of mere humans. That's hardly surprising. Putin is not your average president. On paper, Russia is a democracy. But no objective observer believes that. Putin is the state. Every important decision is made by him. Putin rules in the old-fashioned style of a personality cult. His approval ratings are stratospheric, even if his brazen policies would warrant more significant levels of disagreement. Approval ratings nearing 90% are the product of suppression of dissent and media maneuvers demonizing, ridiculing, and ultimately silencing critics. The system requires propaganda and image control. It needs Putin to be larger than life. The recent murder of Boris Nemtsov, Putin's foremost critic, has spawned fears that there is a hit list, a roster of Putin critics whose days are numbered. There are rampant rumors of intrigue inside the Kremlin. The level of fear is said to be higher than it has been in years. The term \"Kremlinology\" became the study of intrigue and power machinations in inscrutably dark systems. Russia has a long history of concealing the illnesses of its leaders. In the Soviet era, some mysterious disappearances were followed by funerals. In those days, there was usually a succession plan. And in the post-Stalin days, the passing of one leader meant that the party chose the next strongman. In 1991, the last USSR leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, went to his summer home in Crimea. He was visited by a group of high-ranking Soviet officials. The next day, the Russian people were told that Gorbachev was ill, and could not perform his duties. Gorbachev was held against his will. There was a coup in progress. Putin's mentor, President Boris Yeltsin, also had a history of \"disappearing\" from view. He was really ill and\/or drunk. Even if Putin is in perfect health and the social media whirlwind turns out to have just been an outlet for creativity, talk of Putin's disappearance raises important questions. What would Russia become if he suddenly left power? Is there a successor in place? Is there anyone who would continue Putin's policies? If there is a power vacuum, a conceivable scenario given just how thoroughly Putin dominates, what would the consequences be? Whatever Putin is doing at this exact moment -- whether he is hunting tigers, visiting with friends, or convalescing from an illness -- and no matter what he does in the days ahead, the Internet tempest of the past few days is a reminder that the man who embodies today's Russian state, who dismantled the country's once-fledgling democracy, won't be around forever. Which raises the question, what then?","highlights":"Frida Ghitis: It's unclear where President Vladimir Putin is at the moment .\nGhitis: Speculation about his whereabouts went viral as Russian officials posted old photos ."}

{"article":"The England and Wales Cricket Board are set to conduct a 'major review' into the reasons behind the national team's early World Cup exit, although managing director Paul Downton does not expect any changes in the short term. Coach Peter Moores' position has most significantly come under fire after a campaign in which England were rarely competitive, losing four of their five games, to crash out of the tournament with Friday's final group game against Afghanistan still to play. Downton has the power in his hands to end Moores' second spell in charge but in the wake of Monday's 15-run defeat to Bangladesh he has so far sought to back the man he described as 'the outstanding coach of his generation' when he appointed him last April. Peter Moores' place as England coach is safe in the short-term, says ECB managing director Paul Downton . Eoin Morgan's position as captain is in question after England's early exit from the World Cup . It is high praise that Downton still believes Moores is worthy despite an unconvincing record, albeit with a remodelled team, soured further by events over the past month. 'As far as his ability is concerned I still feel he is a very high-quality coach, so, no nothing has changed since we appointed him 11 months ago,' Downton said. Downton says no decisions on the future of players or staff, including Moores, would be made immediately but a review will take place . 'You don't become a bad coach overnight but the scale of the issues we have got to deal with are significant as everybody has seen.' England fly out to the Caribbean for a Test series early next month and while it appears any fall-out from the ECB review is unlikely to strike before then, Downton did baulk at the opportunity to guarantee that Moores would remain in charge. 'All I have said is that we're still within the first year of his appointment,' he said. 'We clearly will have a major review of what's happened in the last six months but particularly during the World Cup. 'Everybody is extremely raw from yesterday's experience but we still have a game left in the World Cup, so no decisions are going to be made in the short term. 'In less than a month we will be in the West Indies playing Test cricket so I don't envisage any short-term changes.' The upcoming review could also leave Downton to feel at some unease. The 57-year-old was not employed by incoming chairman Colin Graves or Tom Harrison, who was appointed as the ECB's chief executive officer last October. Downton will be answerable to both although he has not felt the need to ask for any assurances after revealing they had met for discussions as recently as Monday while England's tournament-ending defeat was ongoing in Adelaide. 'I've worked with Colin Graves on the board for the last year. He's been extremely supportive of everything we've done,' he said. Bangladesh players celebrates after their victory over England that eliminated Morgan's side from the Cup . Downton says incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves, who did not appoint him, has been supportive . 'Tom has been with us for two months and we've spent a lot of time together. Both have been extremely supportive in what we're doing.' England fans had been warned to expect tough times ahead after last winter's Ashes whitewash and Moores was tasked with an unenviable task of rebuilding a side that had lost the considerable experience of Jonathan Trott, Graeme Swann and Kevin Pietersen following his well-publicised falling out with the ECB. The former Lancashire coach has attempted to bring young players through and England's performances immediately suffered as they succumbed to a first-ever home Test series defeat to Sri Lanka. They bounced back strongly to beat India after falling behind in that series, but since then England have struggled in the one-day arena, losing 18 of 27 games under Moores, and the gulf in class between them and the best nations was powerfully illustrated during the World Cup. 'We're in the middle of a very significant rebuilding phase,' Downton said. 'We offered six new central contracts during the summer. My first job when I came in here was to try to re-establish a Test side which we made progress with in the summer. 'The next job was to get to the World Cup with as competitive a side as we could. We always knew we coming from behind. England vice-captain looks dejected after top-scoring with 65 in their loss to Bangladesh on Monday . Moores endures the post-match press conference after his side fell 15 runs short of their target . 'All I will tell you is that there are no quick fixes in this situation. Look through history, look at any very successful side which has broken up, how long it takes sometimes to rebuild again. 'I am very confident that in a year's time, in two years' time this group of players will be battle-hardened and will be more competitive.' While one-day cricket will take a back seat over the next 12 months, when England will embark on a gruelling schedule of 17 Tests, the ECB will use the review to look into ways to ensure the national team can be competitive when the World Cup comes to these shores in 2019. England's senior players are set to be consulted and Downton suggested the possibility of a specific selector for ODIs would be discussed. Meanwhile, all-rounders Chris Woakes and Moeen Ali are fitness doubts for the match against Afghanistan after they both suffered injuries in the defeat to Bangladesh. Woakes left the Adelaide Oval with his left foot in a protective boot after feeling pain during his late bid to save England's World Cup while Moeen suffered side injury while bowling. Both players are set to have scans in Sydney on Wednesday.","highlights":"ECB managing director Paul Downton doesn't expect immediate change .\nEngland crashed out of the World Cup after defeat by Bangladesh .\nThe latest international tournament shame to be subject of a review .\nDownton said Peter Moores remains the high-quality coach they hired .\nHe did not guarantee Moores would not be sacked after the tournament ."}
{"article":"Five bunker shots, four dropped shots, three missed putts from short range, two poor chips and one blow into the water. And that was just the front nine. It's fair to say Rory McIlroy's curious Florida funk continued in the opening round of the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral on Thursday. At least on the back nine there were enough good blows on show to hint it will not be too long before we can enjoy a more customary service. The world number one had an eagle and three birdies in a blistering five hole spell to come home in 33 blows and salvage a 73. While that might have been barely ok in the context of the field as a whole it was a radical improvement on what appeared a likely score at halfway. McIlroy placed the blame on his outward half on being too tentative. 'After nine holes I thought there was really not much more to lose, so go ahead and be more aggressive,' he said. 'It paid off a little and the eagle was really important. Hopefully I can get off to a better start in the second round and get back into it.' Rory McIlroy hits a shot from the fairway during the first round of the Cadillac Championship in Florida . McIlroy lines up a putt on the 16th green during a difficult opening round for the world No 1 . McIlroy tries to play his way out a trouble after landing his shot in the bunker on the 17th hole . He's certainly got some work to do. McIlroy will start out no fewer than 11 shots off the pace set by former American Ryder Cup player JB Holmes. Given there was a decent breeze blowing for most of the day, his 62 was a remarkable effort. Fellow American Ryan Moore shot 66. World number three Henrik Stenson carded a 69 while Welshman Jamie Donaldson, runner-up here last year, composed a 70 comprising 16 pars and two birdies. As for McIlroy, a desperately mediocre outward half of 40 strokes meant he had played his first 45 holes in the Sunshine State this year, taking in last week's two rounds at the Honda Classic, in a startling 11 over par. The world number one thought he had ironed out some difficulties he experienced in the wind last week but there was precious sign of it at this stage. World No 2 Bubba Watson plays his second shot on the 10th hole ad the American finished one under par . Henrik Stenson kept the heat on the leaders as the Swede finished the day's play three under par . Opening up from the tenth offered the chance of a flying start, since there are two par fives in the first three holes. But McIlroy drove into fairway bunkers on both to squander the chance for early gains. Just to compound the frustration, his approach to the par four 11th was a metre short of being perfect, and plugged in a greenside bunker to bring about an unlucky bogey. So it continued. Every good iron shot he played he couldn't take advantage, while every bad shot invariably led to more damage to his scorecard. Two over par coming to the 18th, McIlroy became another victim of this punishing hole as he found the water from the middle of the fairway with his approach, and failed to get up and down for a bogey from the side of the green. Welshman Jamie Donaldson composed a 70 comprising 16 pars and two birdies . It wasn't until his 13th hole that we got the first glimpse of the real Rory. A sumptuous long iron to the difficult par three fourth set up his first birdie of the day and lit the spark on a run that saw him birdie two of the next three holes before registering an eagle three at the 8th. Even during this spell, however, there were sloppy bogeys at the 5th and the 9th. No wonder he headed straight to the range afterwards. Two players who will not be remembering their rounds with any affection were Phil Mickelson and Stephen Gallacher. Mickelson's 74 was notable only for the fact it was the first time in 190 consecutive rounds on the PGA Tour that he had failed to register a single birdie. Poor Gallacher's nightmare was even more complete. The Scot put two balls into the water at the 18th to complete an awful 84. It was his worst competitive score in 455 events as a pro. Lee Westwood, who became the first man to play in 50 WGC events, was one over par after nine .","highlights":"Rory McIlroy played a disastrous front nine\u00a0in the opening round of the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral .\nEven at this early stage, McIlroy had fallen a distance behind his playing partners, world No 2 Bubba Watson and No 3 Henrik Stenson .\nWelshman Jamie Donaldson, runner-up at the tournament last year, composed a 70 comprising 16 pars and two birdies.\nLee Westwood, playing in his 50th WGC event was one over par after nine ."}
{"article":"Bafetimbi Gomis' collapse had those inside White Hart Lane fearing the worst, but thankfully the Swansea striker is fine - in fact, manager Garry Monk revealed he wanted to carry on playing against Tottenham. Hush fell on the ground where Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba suffered a cardiac arrest three years ago after the 29-year-old went down as play was about to restart following Nacer Chadli's wonderful, early opener. Paramedics and medical staff raced to tend to Gomis, who left the field on a stretcher and an oxygen mask after several minutes of treatment. Bafetimbi Gomis lies face down on the pitch after collapsing during  Swansea's game with Tottenham . Medical staff attended to the France international for four minutes before he regained consciousness . The French striker later tweeted in French and then English, saying: 'I wanted to reassure you concerning my health , it actually looks much more scary than physically dangerous and I am feeling well now . 'I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father health that requires me to go back and forth to France . 'I was disappointed that I couldn't help my team tonight but now everything is back In order . 'I also want to thank everyone for their support and get well messages .' Earlier in the evening, news emanated from the Swansea dressing room that it was nothing serious, with the 3-2 loss at Spurs one of several times he has fainted over his career. 'He is fine,' Swans boss Monk said. 'Coming off the pitch he was fine, talking and he actually wanted to stay on the pitch. 'It's something that we're well aware of and it's part of his history, but obviously he's had all the checks. 'We knew about this when he came to the club. He's had all the medical checks that you can possibly do and it's just part of his life. It's to do with low blood pressure. 'I didn't actually see the situation. Our physios went onto the pitch and they relayed the message but he was fine. 'Coming off the pitch, he was talking. He actually wanted to stay on the pitch but obviously precautionary wise, we have to make sure that we double check everything but we're well aware of the history.' Gomis, who has a history of blacking out, is taken off the field on a stretcher at White Hart Lane . Tottenham midfielder Nabil Bentalib (right) holds his head in his hands as Gomis is taken off on a stretcher . Garry Monk revealed that Gomis wanted to carry on playing after collapsing . Monk is not sure whether Gomis, a summer acquisition from Lyon, lost consciousness or not in the incident which stems from a long-standing vasovagal condition. 'We're all well aware of it,' he said. 'He's had every single medical check that you can possibly have, and he's fine. It's just part of his life.' Despite that knowledge, the overriding feeling was still one of relief after the incident proved far less serious than first feared. Gomis has now gone to hospital as a precautionary measure, but Monk foresees 'no problem whatsoever' with him playing their next match against Liverpool on March 16. 'We'll clarify now with the club doctor and see what we do from here, see whether we pick him up or he gets his own car back,' the Swans boss added. Monk does not think the Gomis incident affected his players in the defeat at White Hart Lane - something backed-up by the fact Ki Sung-Yueng drew parity shortly afterwards. Tottenham winger Andros Townsend celebrates after firing home the third goal against Swansea City . Tottenham midfielder Ryan Mason lashed in a right-footed shot for the second against Swansea City . Nacer Chadli (left) beats Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski to score the opening goal . Spurs went back ahead through second-half strikes from Ryan Mason and Andros Townsend, before Gylfi Sigurdsson's late effort led to a nervy ending in what Mauricio Pochettino thinks was a deserved win. 'I'm happy for the players because they deserve this victory,' the Tottenham head coach said, 'It was a very important three points for us, I'm happy for the performance, it was fantastic. 'It was 3-2 but we shoot many times and had more than 60 per cent possession - only in the last minute did we put risk in the game. 'We were lucky to have a big save from Hugo (Lloris in stoppage-time) - one of the best 'keepers in world.' Pochettino also took time in the post-match press conference to wish Gomis a 'speedy recovery'. 'A lot of years ago I had the same problem with team mate Oscar Garcia, who was manager of Watford and Brighton,' he said. 'It's a difficult moment because it's your life. Football is not important when something happens like that. 'I was a player on the pitch and it was Oscar Garcia was my team-mate - he fell and then it was the same situation, but he was okay.'

{"article":"(CNN)Roberto Mancini says he carries Manchester City's supporters in his heart -- but there's not much love being shown towards the man who replaced him as manager of the Premier League champions. Manuel Pellegrini is a man feeling the heat -- and the current City manager has come under fire from his predecessor just 24 hours after insisting he is not under pressure to win a trophy every season. Mancini, the man who led Manchester City to its first Premier League title in 44 years back in 2012 says Pellegrini is \"lucky\" to have inherited the side he left behind after being sacked exactly a year to the day since winning England's top division. Pellegrini, who led City to the domestic title last season, is under fire with City trailing Chelsea by six points in the league and facing elimination in the European Champions League. \"I think Pellegrini was really lucky because he got this team that is a strong team and he has a chance to put in more good players,\" Inter Milan coach Mancini told CNN's Don Riddell on the eve of City's crucial game with Barcelona in the Champions League. \"I think City can win a title every year and have a chance -- it should and must try to win a title every year.\" Nicknamed \"the Engineer,\" Pellegrini has seen the wheels come off his side's title charge in recent weeks. The Chilean is reportedly on the brink with his team having apparently surrendered its Premier League title with another meek showing in the 1-0 defeat by minnow Burnley last weekend. His team have managed just three victories in their past 11 games -- its season could be more or less over by tomorrow night. City faces a daunting task to reach the last eight of the European Champions League -- a competition it has struggled in despite spending $482 million on players since the start of the 2011-12 season. It must overturn a 2-1 deficit against Barcelona at Camp Nou on Wednesday after being outplayed for the majority of the home fixture. Only once in nine attempts has Barcelona won the first leg of a two-legged Champions League knockout tie and not progressed. Pellegrini has spent heavily since arriving at City but a number of those purchases have failed to impress. Eliaquim Mangala, who arrived from Porto for $47million has endured a dismal first season in English football, while $32million man Stevan Jovetic has also struggled to make an impression since arriving from Fiorentina. \"It's my opinion that City is the best team in the Premier League,\" said Mancini. \"It's in second and six points behind Chelsea but I think it's the best team. \"In the Premier League anything can happen right up to the last game, in the last minute,\" perhaps a nod to City's last gasp English Premier League title win in 2012, thanks to Sergio Aguero's stoppage time winner against Queens Park Rangers. \"I think they should think that they have a chance to win the title.\" Mancini, who replaced Mark Hughes in December 2009, enjoyed great success during his three-and-half-year tenure. He led the club to the FA Cup in 2011 before winning the league title the following season. Under Mancini, the club attracted star players such as Yaya Toure, Mario Balotelli, David Silva and Aguero. He signed a new five-year deal with the club in July 2012 but results dipped with rival Manchester United regaining the league title and City suffering a shock FA Cup final defeat by Wigan. Mancini was criticised for his side's lack of success in the Champions League, where the failure to negotiate the group stage playing a key role in the decision to relieve him of his duties. The Italian, 50, was also involved in a series of high-profile disagreements with Carlos Tevez, the Argentina striker, which cast doubts over his ability to handle the big names in the City squad. In the 12 Champions League ties under his stewardship, City managed just three victories -- a damning indictment on the team's failure on the European stage. At the time of his sacking, the club said that Mancini failed to hit \"stated targets\" and that it wanted to \"develop a holistic approach to all aspects of football\". \"I had a fantastic time in England,\" he added. \"We won the Premier League after many years. I have all City's supporters in my heart and all those moments in my head because it is impossible to forget this. \"Maybe I miss the Premier League because I worked there for three-and-a-half years. I built the team that is now in second position. \"I think they play with the same players and I am very proud of this.\" Mancini faces a struggle of his own at Inter with the club unlikely to qualify for European competition next season. Inter is eighth in Serie A and is eight points off the qualifying places for the Europa League. It faces German side Wolfsburg in the last 16 of the Europa League on Thursday having lost the first leg 3-1.","highlights":"Roberto Mancini says Manchester City still the best team in the Premier League .\nItalian says City should win a title every year .\nManuel Pellegrini under growing pressure at club .\nCity faces Barcelona in Champions League on Wednesday ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Food & Wine magazine has released its annual list of the best new chefs across America. Making the cut in 2015 are a chef with a doctorate in neuroscience, a one-time \"Top Chef\" contestant and a culinary artist who plays blues guitar in his free time. The 11 chefs and their restaurants, which will be profiled in the July issue of Food & Wine, span the country as well as the culinary spectrum, specializing in Spanish tapas, rustic Italian, modern American, farm-to-table and even the breakfast and lunch rush. What they all have in common is a willingness to take risks while satisfying the palates of many, says Food & Wine Editor in Chief Dana Cowin. \"I was surprised, and delighted, by how personal these restaurants are,\" said Cowin. \"The chefs seem to be cooking to please themselves, and in the process have dazzled diners.\" Cowin noted a trend: The chefs are nodding toward the past while innovating. \"Chefs are also looking to their families as touchstones,\" she said. \"We've seen a lot of paeans to grandmothers. In fact, Olamaie is named for one of the two chefs' grandmothers. Tim Maslow of Ribelle took over his father's restaurant, Strip T's, and reinvented the food, while leaving the d\u00e9cor the same. Carlos Salgado of Taco Maria was born into a family that had a Mexican-American restaurant and now he's elevated that traditional cooking.\" Though many of the chefs are looking to a simpler time in their lives for inspiration, picking the top cooks in the country is no simple task. First, Food & Wine editors reach out to a \"trusted group of nominators\" around the country, which includes writers for the magazine, past honorees and industry insiders, for their picks. They're looking for chefs who have been creating dishes and running a professional kitchen for five years or less. Editors also comb local magazines and newspapers to find out who is generating buzz regionally. Once the group of candidates is whittled down, Food & Wine visits the restaurants to taste the local fare anonymously. This year's selections include a former scientist, chef Katie Button of Curate in Asheville, North Carolina; \"Top Chef\" season 4 contestant Zoi Antonitsas of Westward in Seattle; and blues-lover Bryce Shuman of Betony in New York City. \"Top Chef\" host Tom Colicchio, famed restaurateur Thomas Keller and international megachefs Daniel Boulud and Nobu Matsuhisa are past honorees. The July issue of Food & Wine hits newsstands in mid-June, and the honored chefs will be in attendance at the annual Food & Wine Classic in Aspen, Colorado, that month.

{"article":"(CNN)When Oakland Raiders NFL running back Maurice Jones-Drew retired recently at just 29 years old, he said his life had been focused on football for 24 years and he needed a change. It's no wonder he wanted out. He has been playing football since he was 5 years old. Sound too young to strap on a helmet? Not really. Jones-Drew is no different from thousands of other boys whose parents introduce them to the gridiron just a few years out of diapers. Football is America's favorite sport. We pride ourselves on our toughness, on our ability to get back up when we're knocked down. What better sport is there to teach those lessons? But today, youth football is not looking like the best option. In 2012, an estimated 225,287 children -- down 9.5% since 2010 -- between the ages of 5 and 14 played Pop Warner football, in which the weight class for the 5-year-olds ranges from 35 to 79 pounds. With such lightweight boys competing with children more than twice their size, it's no wonder parents feel less inclined to put their kids in this sport. But not too long ago, parents thought nothing of sending their children out on the football field to run around and burn up a little energy. Many parents still insist youth football is safe. What could be healthier for a boy? Certainly, it beats sitting in front of a computer all day. That's exactly what Debra Pyka thought when she signed up her son, Joseph Chernach, for Pop Warner football in Wisconsin, then later in Michigan, when he was 11 years old, in 1997. If only she knew then that her son would be dead at 25. Joseph hung himself in his mother's shed on June 7, 2012. His brain was later found to have severe CTE, a degenerative brain disease that has been linked to concussions in football. Joseph Chernach had played sports, including wrestling, pole vaulting and football most of his young life. But he spent almost four years playing Pop Warner football from ages 11 to 14. \"My son was the class comedian, loved school, always fun to be around,\" Pyka told me. \"But we noticed after high school Joseph changed. He got depressed, angry, paranoid and withdrew from sports and his friends. We just didn't know why. After learning about CTE, I knew he had it even before we got the results. The symptoms were all there.\" Pyka is convinced those early days playing Pop Warner football triggered her son's CTE. Last month, Pyka and her son's estate filed a lawsuit against Pop Warner football for $5 million, claiming the nonprofit failed to protect its youngest players and warn them and their parents about the permanent dangers of head trauma. The lawsuit further alleges that Pyka's son and other children were intentionally put in danger because Pop Warner used amateur coaches with short tenures, who were never properly trained in the game of football, injury prevention, concussion or head injury identification. So now, this mother is on a mission. She wants to stop children younger than 14 from playing tackle football in youth leagues. \"I don't want any kids to suffer the way my son suffered, the way my family suffered. It's devastating. Young children should not be allowed to play tackle football until they reach high school,\" said Pyka. Since filing her suit, Pyka, a registered nurse, said she's found some solace by connecting with other parents who want to make football safer for children, but she also has received plenty of hateful emails criticizing her for allowing her son to play in the first place. Critics say that she knew what she was doing when she signed her son up to play football and some even suggest that Pyka should be charged with murder for allowing Joseph to sign up for football, Pyka told me, clearly upset. \"I didn't sign my son up to get a brain disease,\" she said. \"We wanted him to play sports, to be active. We knew nothing about concussions then. It wasn't discussed much. It's still not talked about enough today. Should we all be arrested for letting our kids play football?\" Clearly, the lawsuit faces obstacles, especially since Chernach did play other sports and it may be hard to prove the CTE was triggered by injuries suffered while playing for Pop Warner. But Pyka and her attorney, Gordon Johnson, at the Brain Injury Law Group, which is representing Chernach's estate, insist this case is not just about winning. They are going after the economics of youth football leagues. And if they win the lawsuit it may be less possible for those leagues to buy the insurance policies that allow very young children to play tackle football. \"We have to prove that Pop Warner was a substantial factor in him getting it [CTE], and we knew from research that playing under 12 is when you're most vulnerable,\" Johnson told media when he filed the suit. \"The airing of these issues will benefit everybody,\" he added. Jon Butler, executive director of Pop Warner Little Scholars Inc., told me on Thursday via email:  \"Pop Warner has been, and will continue to be, at the forefront of addressing player safety. ... While there is incredible sadness in this story, we question the merits of singling out four years of youth football amid a career of sports that lasted through high school.\" Still, when the lawyer talk is done, Debra Pyka won't get her son back. And amazingly, she did not sound bitter. And she's not out to end football. But \"a 5-year-old playing football, it's ridiculous to have them out there banging their brains around.\" Some good has come out of all this, said Pkya. More people are talking about CTE. She said it's important that parents listen closely to NFLers like 24-year-old Chris Borland, the San Francisco 49ers linebacker who retired this week after just one season. Borland said he quit because he was afraid of brain injuries. He understands how his decision may affect parents and he has a message: . \" Parents ... if you weigh the risk and decide this is something you want to partake in. ... It's a free country. ... But If I could relay a message to kids and their parents it would be twofold: Number one: make an informed decision. And number two: Don't play through concussions. Who knows how many hits is too many?\" Considering the consequences, it just may be one of the toughest decisions a parent has to make.","highlights":"Roxanne Jones: There's a reason why young NFL players are retiring from the sport .\nShe says youth football is not looking like the best option for kids; parents should know the risks ."}
{"article":"(CNN)In the final days of the Israeli election campaign, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu disavowed the two-state solution and said there would be no Palestinian state on his watch. He also earned universal condemnation for his panicked warning to his followers on election day that Arabs were \"voting in droves\" -- a comment that will resound to his shame and can neither be forgiven nor forgotten unless he apologizes clearly, sincerely and without reservation. And now, facing international uproar and a stern U.S. response, Israeli officials have started backing away from these statements. The Israeli ambassador to Canada, Rafael Barak, said Wednesday on CBC TV, \"This is an election campaign and you have to take with a grain of salt what was said at the last minute when the polls say you are going to lose.\" Netanyahu himself, in an interview on NBC, tried to qualify his words about a two-state solution, saying what he meant to say was that a Palestinian state was not viable under present conditions. He knows that stance is totally unacceptable to Israel's chief ally, the United States, and to the rest of the international community. And he should not be allowed to slip off the hook so easily. Indeed, far from taking this statement with a grain of salt, the world is likely to look back at his previously stated support for a two-state solution and take that with more than a grain of salt. The fact is, rhetorical if not actual support for a two-state solution has served Netanyahu well for the past several years, and has provided him with a convenient shield against international pressure to end the almost 48-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. Also helping Netanyahu was the presence in his Cabinet of Israeli politicians who actually do believe in a two-state solution and worked hard to make it happen -- notably former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, who headed up the failed 2014 negotiations with the Palestinians. Livni wanted to move forward in the talks, but found herself hemmed in and frustrated by Netanyahu's aides -- and apparently by the prime minister himself -- at every turn. Now, as he constructs a coalition of ultranationalists and ultra-Orthodox, those shields have been stripped away. Netanyahu must now face the world having bared his true face and exposed his true beliefs -- and the international community, led by the United States, must respond accordingly. What should this involve? To begin with, Washington should not wait for others to draft a U.N. resolution condemning the settlements. It should take the initiative, in consultation with its international partners, in drafting a resolution that lays out the detailed parameters for an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The resolution should of course state unequivocally that the solution rests in an Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 lines, with equivalent land swaps to incorporate some of the major settlement blocs within Israel. It should also reiterate Israel's right to security. And it should state clearly and unambiguously that the settlements are illegal under international law and must stop. Words are important -- but more important are deeds. Whatever he says about the two-state solution, the next Netanyahu government is virtually certain to blast ahead with settlement-building. It is on that basis that he and his administration should be diplomatically isolated and condemned. In his campaign statement, Netanyahu took pride in approving the construction of a huge suburb on the southern fringes of Jerusalem in order to block Palestinian construction from neighboring Bethlehem. He boasted that the building was not simply to provide housing for Jews rather than Palestinians, but that it was to make it harder for the Palestinians to establish a coherent, territorially contiguous state. Netanyahu's statement was a moment of truth for him, for Israel and for the world. He was admirably blunt and concise. He left no doubt what he intended. Now, the world must hold him to account.","highlights":"Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed idea of Palestinian state during campaign .\nAlan Elsner: Israeli officials have started backing away from his statements ."}
{"article":"(CNN)How can I describe life in Crimea after a year under Russia's control? You start saying things like \"Let's not talk about this on the phone\" and become careful about the Facebook pages you \"like.\" Because total surveillance and control has become routine -- like it was in the Soviet Union. In just one year so much has been lost and many Crimeans seem to have forgotten rights that were part of everyone's life. There is a growing level of censorship, inequality and political repression of those who don't agree with the government. In everyday communication, Crimeans, including those who support Putin and Russia, have to think about what they do and say. Thanks to the activities of the FSB (Russia's secret police) denunciation -- where a citizen tells the authorities about the wrongdoing of another -- is popular again. In the Soviet Union, especially in the late 1930s, denunciations written by Soviet citizens about their neighbors, friends and even relatives resulted in millions of victims in prisons and Gulag camps. Now in Crimea, no one feels safe. Anyone who doesn't like you can write a denunciation and the next day you will take part in a \"joyful\" conversation with the security services. Significant changes have also taking place in the most basic of rights, like freedom of movement. Now, there are two borders manned by armed -- and sometimes angry -- men who always have questions about where you are going and why you want to pass. For ethnic Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars, things have been very difficult and thousands fled to mainland Ukraine in the first months after annexation. Their fears were confirmed when Ukrainian activists and young Tatars began to disappear. Some were later found dead, others are still missing. Ukrainian patriots also left in the first month or two after occupation -- it would have been dangerous and uncomfortable to continue living on the peninsula. The next wave of migrants were those who hoped to adjust to the new rules, but could not. They started leaving when it became clear that things would get worse economically and politically. They have been replaced by a new set of arrivals from Russia: Officials, police, FSB and other authorities. After annexation, many who had worked for the Ukrainian government in the police, army and security services swapped allegiances to the Russian side. The Kremlin was happy to have them but has put special stamps the new recruit's personal files, which say they are \"inclined to betrayal.\" One of the main arguments of pro-Russian locals is that the average salary in Russia is much higher. Indeed, since annexation, salaries have increased, especially in the public institutions like hospitals and schools. The salary increases caused a kind of post-referendum euphoria, which quickly fizzled in late 2014 when a strong dollar meant higher prices for everything from food to gadgets. Then wages were cut again, by anywhere from 30% to 70% depending on the industry. Many doctors and teachers were greatly dissatisfied with wage cuts, but no one protested because in Russia, you must obtain permission for a public assembly. Of course, permission is mostly given to people or organizations loyal to the Kremlin. Tourism, a formerly dependable income source for many Crimeans, has been hit very hard. More than half of all tourists who used to visit Crimea in the summer were Ukrainian and last year tourism was down by 50%. Last summer, the peninsula was empty and many hotel owners had almost no customers. Despite of the deteriorating economic and human rights situation, many of those who were for the annexation of Crimea continue to support Russia. As strange as it may sound, the harder life becomes here in Crimea, the more people support Putin and hate Ukraine. In a little over a year, the Russian propaganda machine has turned Ukraine from \"brother state\" to Russia's main enemy. For some Crimeans 2014 was a year of tragedy and farewell to their homeland. Others saw a dream realized. What things will look like in another year is unclear, but what is clear is that nothing will be the same again.","highlights":"Life under total surveillance and control now the norm in Crimea, says writer .\nOld Soviet practice of denunciation has become commonplace, he says .\nHe writes: The harder life gets in Crimea, the more people support Putin ."}
{"article":"(CNN)In the two years since \"Lean In\" became a best-seller and sparked countless conversations about gender equality, author Sheryl Sandberg says she has gotten one question over and over from men: What can they do? Now the Facebook chief operating officer is giving them some specific answers by aligning with one of the most popular athletes on the planet. If LeBron James is encouraging men to lean in for women, don't you think some of his 19 million Twitter followers will get the message too? That's certainly what Sandberg and her LeanIn.org colleagues are hoping, following their brand new partnership with the National Basketball Association and the Women's National Basketball Association and the creation of a public service campaign called #LeanInTogether. In a 30-second video of NBA and WNBA all-stars, we see James of the Cleveland Cavaliers holding up a poster, which says \"All-Star Dad.\" Dwayne Wade of the Miami Heat says, \"When men lean in, everyone wins,\" and then touts how he leans in for his wife, mother and grandmother. \"Help women aim high,\" says Al Horford of the Atlanta Hawks. The significance of the message and the men who are relaying it is twofold, says Sandberg. To truly bring about equality at home and at work, men need to be part of the discussion, and we need to bring the discussion to where men are, she says. Sheryl Sandberg at BlogHer: Not every woman has to be a CEO . \"The conversation about equality has long existed by women, for women, in women's forums where women are, and that will continue, and that's important. But bringing it to the center of the court, bringing men to the center of that conversation -- people like LeBron James and Steph Curry (of the Golden State Warriors) and Dwayne Wade, saying 'I'm in for equality and here's why' -- I think that could be transformative,\" said Sandberg in a phone interview. What Sandberg and LeanIn.org are also hoping to do is show men specifically what they can do, providing a series of tips about things they could start doing at home and at work, and as managers, as soon as they finish reading this story. Many of the suggestions might seem like common sense to many women -- such as male managers giving women credit in meetings and men sharing 50-50 in household and child care duties at home. But Sandberg says with the list of \"simple, clear, everyday things, practical things\" men can do that are based on real data, men will see not only how they can help but how they individually will benefit. For instance, research shows that boys and girls with a more involved father are healthier, mentally and physically, happier, have stronger emotional attachments and relationships, are at lower risk for substance abuse and are more successful at work and at home, Sandberg said. For girls, there's an extra benefit, she said. By age 14, if a girl sees her father doing child care and housework, her concept of the array of things she can do professionally is much broader than that of girls who don't see their fathers doing household chores, she said, pointing to a study by the University of British Columbia and published in a journal of the Association for Psychological Science. \"The way men react when you tell them children of more active fathers of any income level, no matter how active a mother is, do better -- a lot of men, particularly those with wives who are home (and who say) 'I'm covered. My kids are in good hands' ... they are motivated,\" said Sandberg. Despite 'Lean In,' workplace equality remains abysmal . Dads might think they are doing all they can by telling their daughters they can be anything they want, but if Mom is still doing all the cooking and cleaning, their girls aren't getting the full message. \"What really matters is seeing what you do. You have to walk the walk. She needs to see equality to believe it.\" Another huge goal, Sandberg says, is showing men they won't lose out in the workplace when there is more equality in the executive suites and in boardrooms. \"If you've long been in the majority and long held power, and you see change, you could naturally be nervous that this wasn't going to help you,\" said Sandberg. Men need to realize it's not a zero sum game, she said. \"When companies do better, there are more jobs, more promotions, more salaries for everyone. When companies do worse, there's less for everyone,\" she said. She mentioned a recent study by the International Monetary Fund, which found that if women were in the workforce at the same percentage as men in the U.S., our country's gross domestic product would grow by 5%. \"We haven't seen 5% GDP growth in a long time. ... That's a lot of jobs for a lot of people, so understanding that this is beneficial for everyone, I think, is huge.\" Work-life balance not just a women's issue . Sandberg's #LeanInTogether comes as emphasis seems to be growing on getting boys and men to think about gender equality. Sandberg will be one of the opening night speakers at a four-day conference on engaging men and boys that begins Thursday in New York. The conference is sponsored by The Center for the Study of Men and Masculinities at Stony Brook University. In January, a U.N. conference sponsored by Iceland and Suriname, which I was honored to attend as a panel participant, brought together ambassadors, other policymakers, and athletes and artists, with the goal of changing the discourse among men on gender equality. An overriding message repeated at the conference was that we can't keep telling men what to do. We need to show them what many men are already doing every day at home and at work. \"Dad' gets a makeover in Super Bowl ads . That is why the recent focus on caring dads in ads during this year's Super Bowl was so applauded by men like sociologist Michael Kimmel, who is spearheading this week's New York conference on men and masculinities. \"This provides a counternarrative to all the action hero, buffoon images that we see,\" Kimmel told me when I talked to him days before the Super Bowl. Kimmel said very few men, fewer than 10%, can relate to the way the media depict masculinity, according to a study conducted by Dove Men+Care. Kimmel was hired by the brand as an adviser to help analyze its research. Men today are spending far more time doing housework and helping with child care and are enjoying more egalitarian relationships than any generation in American history, and their ideas about what it means to be a man have begun to shift as well, said Kimmel, who is the author of more than 20 books including \"Manhood in America: A Cultural History.\" Sandberg says we need to recognize and support the new definitions of masculinity and hopes the message from stars like James and Wade goes a long way toward doing that. \"I am increasingly convinced that unless we fully accept men as caregivers, we can't fully accept women as leaders,\" she said. \"We've got to stop calling it 'Mommy and me.' As long as we are calling it 'Mommy and me,' we are communicating to women that this is their job ... and we have to do both sides of this.\" Admittedly impatient about gender equality (I'm impatient too!), Sandberg concedes we have a long way to go until the gender equality problem is solved and LeanIn.org can close its doors. \"We have been fighting for equality for too long,\" she said, noting that women starting earning about 50% of college degrees back in 1981. \"Thirty-four years is plenty of time to get 50% of the top jobs, and we're not close. We're at 5(%) in the Fortune 500. And so we have to change, we have to change more. We have to get more people involved.\" Enter King James.

{"article":"(The Hollywood Reporter)Sam Simon, the nine-time Emmy Award-winning comedy writer and producer who helped develop \"The Simpsons,\" made millions after leaving the show in 1993 and then donated his riches to charity, has died, his foundation announced on Facebook. He was 59. Simon was diagnosed in February 2013 with terminal colon cancer. Yet through it all, he tried to remain upbeat and keep his sense of humor. \"The Museum of Broadcasting called and said, 'We were thinking about doing an archive interview with you. Do you mind if we did it now?' \" Simon said with a laugh on Marc Maron's WTF podcast that first ran in May 2013. During his brief career, the influential Simon also served as the showrunner on the sitcom \"Taxi\" at the age of 23; wrote for and produced the comedies \"Cheers\" and \"The Drew Carey Show\"; and created a Fox series for the legendary stand-up comic George Carlin in the mid-1990s. Simon also wrote the 1991 film \"The Super,\" a 20th Century Fox comedy starring Joe Pesci as a New York slumlord. Most recently, Simon was a consultant on the Charlie Sheen series \"Anger Management\" and hosted a show on Radioio.com. He showed up frequently on Howard Stern's SiriusXM show and in March 2013 thanked the acerbic host for being \"the perfect friend.\" Story: Terminally Ill 'Simpsons' Co-Creator Vows to Give Away Fortune . A cartoonist and Stanford graduate, Simon developed \"The Simpsons\" with Matt Groening (who came up with the characters based on his family) and producer James L. Brooks. All three had worked on \"The Tracey Ullman Show,\" where Bart Simpson and his family got their start as animated sketches shown before and after commercials. \"The Simpsons,\" centering on TV's \"first fully self-aware dysfunctional family,\" as Simon put it, debuted on Fox on December 17, 1989, and is now the longest-running primetime series in American history. Ken Levine, an Emmy winner who has written for \"The Simpsons\" and other sitcoms, described Simon's contribution to the show during a 2009 interview published in Stanford Magazine. \"Sam brought a level of honesty to the characters,\" Levine said. \"Is it too bizarre to say he made cartoon characters three-dimensional? His comedy is all about character, not just a string of gags. In 'The Simpsons,' the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles. 'What are they thinking?' -- that is Sam's contribution. The stories come from the characters.\" Simon also is credited with assembling the show's elite writing team that included Al Jean, George Meyer, John Swartzwelder, Mike Reiss, Jon Vitti and Conan O'Brien. Story: James L. Brooks on 'Simpsons' journey . \"I remember Sam coming into the room, and me pitching to him and initially being really intimidated,\" O'Brien told Vanity Fair in 2007. \"He's hilarious. It was fun to try and make him laugh. I remember that about Sam. If I could make Sam laugh, I was excited.\" Tired of the grind, Simon exited the show in 1993 after four seasons but worked out a deal tied to home video sales that he said paid him \"tens of millions\" every year. The agreement also guaranteed him executive producer credit long after he departed, and his name appears in the credits of every episode. A couple of years after he left, Simon knew he would have enough money to retire from show business. He was in his mid-30s. As detailed in The Hollywood Reporter's 2013 Philantrophy Issue, Simon's charitable contributions include founding the Malibu-based Sam Simon Foundation (worth nearly $23 million as of 2011) that rescues the hungry and feeds stray dogs. His other pet charities include PETA, which in February thanked him for his support by naming its Norfolk, Virginia, headquarters The Sam Simon Center; international nonprofit Save the Children; and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a global marine conservation organization. His generosity led the latter in 2012 to name one of the four ships in its fleet of vessels -- used to hinder whaling and illegal fishing -- the M\/Y Simon. Simon also turned a Malibu spread into a canine haven that rescues dogs from kill shelters and trains them as companions for the deaf. \"The sort of lifetime achievement stuff that I'm getting now is kind of like Tom Sawyer's funeral because they all know I'm sick,\" Simon told THR's Gary Baum. \"I am getting buildings named after me and awards and stuff. The truth is, I have more money than I'm interested in spending. Everyone in my family is taken care of. And I enjoy this.\" In May 2014, it was revealed that Simon spent $60,000 to rescue an abused thoroughbred. Simon, who won eight of his Emmys for writing\/producing \"The Simpsons\" (many after he left) and one for producing \"The Tracey Ullman Show,\" was married to and divorced from actress Jennifer Tilly (1984 to 1991) and Playboy Playmate Jami Ferrell (for mere weeks in 2000). Neither marriage produced any children. Born June 6, 1955, Simon grew up in Beverly Hills in an era when the neighborhood was \"quaint,\" as he put it. Groucho Marx lived across the street, and he recalled walking into his parents' room as a youngster and finding the legendary comic and his mom sitting on the bed. (He stressed they weren't about to have sex.) Another time, Elvis Presley returned the dog that Simon had lost. While at Stanford, Simon drew cartoons for the local newspapers in San Francisco and the school paper and landed a job at Filmation Studios doing storyboards for \"The New Adventures of Mickey Mouse\" and \"Heckle & Jeckle.\" Simon scored his first TV writing gig on the animated \"Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids\" in 1979. He mailed in a script to \"Taxi\" (co-created by Brooks) that was accepted, and that led to a staff writing position and then the job as showrunner. Simon also went on to direct episodes of the Carlin show, \"The Drew Carey Show,\" \"Friends,\" \"Norm\" and \"Anger Management.\" An avid poker player, Simon re-created his home game in a penthouse at the Palms Hotel in Las Vegas for a Playboy TV show in 2009. The show also featured Tilly -- a very good player -- as well as comedians Dave Attell, Norm Macdonald, Jeffrey Ross and Artie Lange. Another one of Simon's more eclectic pursuits was working the corner at amateur fights and serving as president of Sweet Science Inc., which managed boxer Lamon Brewster. His fighter stunningly knocked out Wladimir Klitschko to win a share of the heavyweight championship in 2004. During his chat with Maron, Simon noted that the way to know when to put down your ailing dog is to \"list the three things he loves to do. When he can't do those any longer, it's time. \"One of my three things is laying in bed and watching TV. So by that criteria, I will never be euthanized.\" Later, talking about all the millions he's given to charity, he added: \"I kinda like it when people talk about me as a special person. But I know I would be a nut if I didn't have a lot of money.\" People we've lost in 2015 . \u00a92015 The Hollywood Reporter.

'If I had to replace those who were not playing at their best, I would have to change the whole squad,' the Italian told the Spanish media on Monday. 'The whole team needs to improve. I'm sure Bale is not happy with what he is doing and he understands that and wants to do better.'

{"article":"(CNN)The sun cuts across Lake Nicaragua, casting shadows across lush flora and brightly colored boats. Rowing in unison, two girls paddle a canoe to school. Life on Lake Nicaragua is peaceful, rustic and isolated, but this could change with the pending completion of a canal that builders are likening to Panama's famed waterway. Headed by Hong Kong-based consortium HK Nicaragua Canal Development Investment Company (HKND), the $50 billion Nicaragua Canal (also called the Nicaragua Grand Canal and Interoceanic Canal) would create a gargantuan new shipping route through Nicaragua by connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. HKND was granted a 50-year concession by the Nicaraguan government in 2013 to build and operate the 278-kilometer (172 miles) canal, reportedly with the option for an extension. Construction will run from the Rio Punta Gorda on the Caribbean Coast to Brito on the Pacific. At up to 1,700 feet wide and 90 feet deep, the canal, if completed, will be deeper and wider than the Panama Canal. HKND announced the start of construction of the canal with a ceremony on December 22, 2014. The canal will run through Lake Nicaragua (among other areas), Central America's largest lake and freshwater reservoir, which not only preserves an integral part of Nicaragua's ecosystem, but directly supports numerous communities. By some estimates, 30,000 people will have to be relocated to carve a path for the canal. The prospect is nothing short of alarming for those living in the area, and those who cherish its untouched splendor. With the pending completion of the canal in 2019, Lake Nicaragua may be impacted in ways only time will reveal. Environmental experts worry that the shallow waters of the lake won't be able to withstand the dredging that will come with construction. Additionally, communities will likely be displaced and wetlands may become more vulnerable to destruction. \"In terms of the canal impact on Lake Nicaragua, one big concern is the damage to the quality of the water; the ship traffic will pollute the water with toxic sediments and industrial chemicals and introduce destructive invasive species, plants and animals,\" Dr. Jorge A. Huete-Perez, vice president of the Nicaraguan Academy of Sciences and director of the Molecular Biology Center at the University of Central America told CNN. \"Dredging of the lake for the construction of the canal will render the lake a 'dead zone' because of hypoxia, eutrophication and turbidity.\" In January, London-based scidev.net reported that an independent commission of experts -- including scientists from the InterAmerican Network of Academies of Science, Nicaraguan Academy of Sciences and International Council for Science -- had reached similar conclusions, warning of \"unintended adverse consequences that could do economic, environmental and social harm.\" Like other critics of the canal construction, Huete-Perez wants greater transparency from HKND and the Nicaraguan government. \"This whole thing has been fast-tracked without public consultations or the opportunity for an informed, documented debate,\" said Huete-Perez. On January 9, 2015, HKND responded to concerns about the lake's impact on communities in a statement on its website. \"From July 21 to July 30, 2014, we and our environmental and social impact advisor, Environmental Resources Management (ERM), held scoping meetings across Nicaragua.  Approximately 5,000 people participated in the scoping meetings, including housewives, students, professionals, agricultural producers, fishermen, artisans, businessmen and scholars,\" reads the company's statement, in part. The company says it held a press conference broadcast in real time to the public to announce the route of the canal and comment on the technical, geological, cultural and environmental impact of the project. Some skeptics doubt the hyper-ambitious canal is realistic. Pedro Alvarez, chairman of civil engineering at Rice University, has expressed doubts that it will ever be completed. He worries that it will be abandoned. His greatest concern is severe damage to Lake Nicaragua. Despite the concerns of environmental experts, the project is underway, making a visit to this beautiful area more compelling than ever. Largely unmarred by development, Lake Nicaragua is a sight to behold. During my recent guided visit with Nicaragua Vacations, I took a boat tour through the Islets of Granada, home to 365 scattered islands with majestic views of Mombacho volcano. At times, there was no other boat in sight -- only the rustle of a hidden howler monkey in the bushes and the volcano, ensconced in clouds and morning fog. The feeling of being everywhere and nowhere at once is part of Lake Nicaragua's charm. Another part of its charm is the people who live on it. At Padre Nello School on Lake Nicaragua, about 90 children canoe to school each day. Jicaro Island EcoLodge works with Padre Nello to bring clean water to the children and educational projects that encourage sustainability on the lake. Guests of the lodge can arrange visits. The islets are just southeast of the city of Granada (population approximately 120,000), where colonial buildings defy time, narrow alleyways lead to garden courtyards, charming boutiques are full of local art and street carts overflow with everything from iguanas to cashews. While Granada pulses with Old World charm, Lake Nicaragua stands still with nature as its compass, mostly untouched by modernity. For now. Nicaragua Vacations; +1 866 347 4012 .

{"article":"(CNN)The man who attacked a security area at the New Orleans airport with a machete and wasp spray also had a bag of Molotov cocktails and a car containing smoke bombs and gas cylinders, authorities said. The suspect, Richard White, 63, died Saturday after treatment for three bullet wounds he suffered when a sheriff's lieutenant fired at him to halt the Friday night attack, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office said. Sheriff Newell Normand said earlier that investigators hadn't been able to talk to White, who officials said suffered from some type of mental illness. He said White's wife and children had been very cooperative. Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport was back open and fully operational, Mayor Mitch Landrieu said. He praised security officials for acting quickly and heroically and doing everything they could to stop the attack. The incident began when White, carrying a bag, entered one of the lanes at the security checkpoint for Concourse B and began spraying Transportation Security Administration agents and bystanders with a can of wasp spray, the sheriff's office said. He then pulled a machete from his waistband and began swinging it at agents and others in the area. \"What I saw originally was one of the officers getting sprayed with the wasp spray,\" said TSA agent Carol Richel, whose arm was hit by one of the bullets fired at White. The officer being sprayed with wasp spray picked up a bag and threw it at White to slow him down, but the suspect still barged through, Richel told reporters. Richel, who was not armed, yelled for everyone to run as she made her way toward the sheriff's lieutenant, who she knew had a weapon. \"I was calling, 'Run, run' for them to get away from him, and I was calling for the (lieutenant) so she was there and alert,\" Richel said. \"I didn't hear him say anything,\" she said. \"Once I yelled for the checkpoint to be cleared, I looked over my shoulder and he was coming after me. And I ran as fast as I could and thank God the officer was as close as she was, because I wouldn't be here today.\" She said the man came \"within inches\" of whacking her with the machete. \"This man was swinging very hard, very hard with that machete,\" Richel said. \"And if he would have made contact with anybody, it would have been terrible.\" Normand said Lt. Heather Slyve fired three shots, ultimately stopping the attacker. He said investigators believe it was the first shot that went through Richel's upper right arm. Richel showed off a bright pink bandage on her arm and said the bullet went through her tricep. \"Originally, I thought the machete hit me. I didn't realize it was a bullet,\" she said. \"I knew he was close, so I honestly thought he hit me and she shot him.\" When White approached the checkpoint, he was carrying a bag that he dropped as soon as the first agent confronted him, Normand said. \"What the bag revealed was six half-pint mason jars with cloth wicks into a liquid that we now know to be gasoline -- what you would commonly refer to as a Molotov cocktail,\" Normand said. A grill lighter and plastic letter opener were also in the bag, and next to his body investigators found powdery material and wicks, which they determined were from crushed smoke bombs. \"The fact that he ended up dropping the bag (when) the TSA agent threw an item at him was huge in the short 40-second span ... of this event,\" Normand said. \"Had he been able to hold onto the bag, he might not have continued to chase the TSA agents through the checkpoint. He might have gone somewhere else.\" The bomb squad found more smoke bombs in his car, and in the trunk were three gas tanks -- one for Freon, one for oxygen and one for acetylene, a compressed gas used in welding and metal-cutting. Normand said their intended purpose wasn't clear. Normand said \"there is a mental illness component\" in their investigation of the suspect. \"No one at this point in time has any notion about what may have triggered this behavior,\" Normand said. \"And not unlike dealing with the mentally ill, sometimes you will never know what actually triggers some of this type of behavior.\" People who had recently interacted with White described him as very cordial, calm, cool and collected, Normand said. They reported having no suspicions about him and said nothing seemed out of the ordinary. It wasn't clear why White was at the airport. Contrary to earlier reports, Normand said Saturday, White was no longer a taxi driver. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo, Joe Sutton, Tony Marco and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","highlights":"Suspect dies after treatment for bullet wounds .\nSheriff says the suspect also had smoke bombs and Molotov cocktails .\nRichard White allegedly stormed an airport security area with a machete ."}

{"article":"WASHINGTON (CNN)During his upcoming speech to Congress, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will lay out the details of what he understands to be the nuclear agreement between world powers and Iran, hoping it will prompt lawmakers to question the administration and delay the March 24 deadline for a political agreement. A senior Israeli official traveling in Netanyahu's delegation, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said the Israeli government had \"a good understanding of the agreement we can draw conclusions from.\" \"We know what we know. And believe me, we know a lot of information about this agreement,\" the official told reporters aboard the flight to Washington. \"The Prime Minister is going to Congress to explain what they don't know about this agreement that it is a bad agreement.\" Will speech backfire?

He described the Prime Minister's speech as a \"last chance\" to speak directly to Congress before a March 24 deadline for a political framework agreement about the elements believed to be in the deal. The official would not disclose how the Israeli government reportedly had more information on the deal than the U.S. Congress, but noted that many of the parties were leaking details of the talks. However, in congressional testimony before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee last week, Secretary of State John Kerry said, \"Anybody running around right now jumping in to say, 'Well, we don't like the deal' or this or that, doesn't know what the deal is. There is no deal yet. And I caution people to wait and see what these negotiations produce.\" The official suggested Netanyahu would urge lawmakers in his Tuesday address to pressure the Obama administration to push the deadline so more discussion can take place about what he perceives is a dangerous deal that leaves Iran with the ability to develop a nuclear weapon down the line. \"There is no sacred date,\" the official said of the March 24 deadline. \"It can be put off. It is not fixed. They can change it\" The official said that as the March 24 deadline approaches, Netanyahu will warn \"be careful of giving up compromises. They are compromises and they are not good.\" Obama hinted last week that he did not see the need for any additional extensions, saying the talks have, \"sufficiently narrowed and sufficiently clarified that we're at the point where they need to make a decision.\" That deadline was agreed to by the five parties and Iran, which is why Kerry is having marathon meetings with the Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Geneva beginning again this week. 6 questions about Netanyahu's visit . Netanyahu spoke with Kerry on the eve of his trip, the official said, adding that despite the fraught political tone of Netanyahu's visit, the United States and Israel continue to communicate through intelligence channels. Intelligence and national security officials, this official said, met last week with National Security Adviser Susan Rice and Wendy Sherman, the lead U.S. negotiator for the Iran talks. \"The objective of Israel is to get a better agreement,\" the official said. \"We want a good agreement. We are not against all agreements and the Prime Minister never said we were.\"","highlights":"Netanyahu to speak to members of Congress on Tuesday .\nNetanyahu to warn of making bad deal with Iran, source says .\nCongress has \"no understanding\" of the deal shaping up, source says ."}
{"article":"(CNN)The first official visit of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to Washington comes as excitement mounts over the possibility that direct peace negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban are imminent. The visit, which began Sunday, offers the opportunity for discussion and progress on a number of fronts, the coming face-to-face talks with the Taliban almost certainly among them. But while the start of such talks would certainly be a positive development, it would hardly be a sign that peace is about to descend upon a land ravaged by decades of war. The reality is that an agreement with the Taliban that is good for the Afghan government is probably impossible right now. Negotiations to end the Taliban insurgency face a series of significant challenges, and an imperfect deal could harm Afghanistan's nascent unity government, encourage the formation of splinter groups of hardened fighters, boost existing terrorist groups like al Qaeda and ISIS and plunge the country into an era of renewed violence and instability. That said, the United States should remain broadly supportive of these talks by promoting conditions that could make the possibility of success more likely down the road -- history has shown that successful negotiations most often occur when each party has some vulnerability to the other. Militarily, the Taliban is not the Afghan government's equal, but that does not mean the insurgents lack a strong negotiating position. For a start, the international presence in Afghanistan is declining, freeing the Taliban to operate more openly in the rural corners of the country. Meanwhile, Afghan security forces are being killed at rates that are probably not sustainable and civilian casualties are at an all-time high. Most troublingly, the new national unity government has yet to clearly demonstrate its ability to govern. All this means that until the new government shows that the diverse interests within it can coexist, and it articulates a cohesive strategy to counter the Taliban, the insurgents can make a strong case for postponing peace in the hopes of a better situation in the future. A second key to negotiating a path toward peace in Afghanistan is devising a strategy to contain splinter groups. Often in the course of negotiations, those unsatisfied with the peace process flock to new organizations to continue the fight. These can include so-called \"bitter enders,\" hardened fighters who want no part of peace. The emergence of splinter groups is an expected part of any peace negotiation process, but it must be minimized for an agreement to take hold. In the case of Afghanistan, there is no shortage of groups willing to absorb fighters, from outlaw bandit groups to al Qaeda. Recently, as Ghani has highlighted, there have even been stories of fighters declaring allegiance to terrorist group ISIS. It goes without saying that the spread of ISIS's particularly violent form of extremism within Afghanistan would make an already complex and precarious security situation all the more so. Finally, negotiations must happen at a time when a peace agreement can reasonably be enforced -- it is one thing to craft a compromise and quite another to carry it out. Too often in peace negotiations, an agreement is viewed as a finish line, but any deal can easily be derailed by unpopular political accommodations, economic incentives and rebel fighters who refuse to drop their arms. To take hold, peace agreements require a legitimate and effective government capable of communicating new realities to the public and executing policies that are often untried and complex. At the moment, the Afghan government is struggling to carry out existing policies, while juggling the country's many divergent interests. While a peace agreement would certainly boost the legitimacy of a national unity government, a stillborn accord would only lead to disillusionment and doubt. Ultimately, the chances that talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban will succeed are remote at best. Yet the United States should do everything it can to help create the underlying conditions to support productive negotiations -- if not now, at some point in the future. What can the U.S. do? Two things: . First, the Obama administration could agree to the Afghan government's request to slow American troop withdrawals. This would allow the United States to assist the Afghan government to stabilize the country and contain any splintering anti-government factions. Second, the U.S. could remain actively engaged in promoting the success of the Afghan national unity government. This means not merely maintaining existing development and economic efforts, but finding opportunities to assist the new government to boost its legitimacy. For example, the United States could support emerging efforts to build a meaningful relationship between Afghanistan and its neighbor Pakistan, which would increase public confidence in the government's ability to protect its people. It also could lend a hand advising political leaders, including the many first-time cabinet officials, on governance and public service. Sowing the seeds of future success in bringing peace to Afghanistan requires no new U.S. boots on the ground or extravagant financial commitments. Rather, it takes a willingness to continue to engage with Afghanistan's dynamic set of political challenges in small, but meaningful ways.","highlights":"Afghan President Ashraf Ghani is visiting the United States .\nRebecca Zimmerman: U.S. doesn't need more boots on ground ."}
{"article":"Tim Sherwood has expressed his relief at Aston Villa's crucial victory against West Brom and claims the three points are so important, that he'd rather them than his wife win the Euro Millions jackpot. Christian Benteke's last-minute penalty earned the former Tottenham boss his first win in charge as Villa climbed out of the Premier League relegation places. During the game, Sherwood was a bundle of energy on the touchline but could hardly bear to watch as his Belgian striker kept his cool to slot the ball past Ben Foster. VIDEO Tim Sherwood: Told the wife I'd take three points over lottery jackpot . Sherwood appeals to the referee after Matt Lowton was brought down by Ben Foster in stoppage time . The Aston Villa boss looks to the heavens as his side pressed for a winner against West Brom at Villa Park . Sherwood celebrate with his staff after Christian Benteke's penalty sealed a vital victory for his strugglers . Sherwood went through an emotional rollercoaster and held his pulse to the Aston Villa fans . 'It's incredible, a fantastic feeling to win. My wife said she did the Euro Millions and gets \u00a354million if she wins. I said I'd rather take three points and I genuinely mean that,' he said on BT Sport. 'It's brilliant to win because in the first games we were not that fantastic, but we were vastly improved today. We need to improve but we are making ground. I think it's important the guys spark the crowd. We did that early by pressing off the ball. 'We mixed the game up at times by going long and short and we gave fans something to cheer about. This is a big club at the wrong end of the division.' Sherwood says he'd rather take the three points then his wife win the Euro Millions jackpot . The 2-1 result also ended a seven-game losing run for Villa and lifted them out of the Barclays Premier League relegation zone. Sherwood felt his pulse and gestured to the Villa fans as he walked off and believes the strugglers are fighting again. 'I was saying we're alive. There were people who wrote us off but we're alive and kicking. People will look at that result but the performance was great,' he said, with Villa three points clear of the drop zone. It was a tense affair throughout the 90 minutes and Sherwood appeared to show every kind of emotion . Benteke scored in the league for the first time since December and Sherwood admitted the striker had told him exactly what he would do with a penalty. He said: 'Goalscorers are there to be shot down and it takes a brave man to stand up there. I asked him before the game if he gets a penalty what he was going to do. 'He said 'I'll wait until the goalie goes down and I'll roll it in the corner'. I was still peeping through my fingers.' Gabby Agbonlahor opened the scoring and had two cleared off the line, while also having a penalty claim ignored after he beat Foster to the ball.

{"article":"(CNN)In his writings, author Avijit Roy yearned for reason and humanism guided by science. He had no place for religious dogma, including from Islam, the main religion of his native Bangladesh. Extremists resented him for openly and regularly criticizing religion in his blog. They threatened to kill him if he came home from the United States to visit. On Thursday, someone did. As usual, Roy defied the threats and departed his home in suburban Atlanta for Dhaka, where he appeared at a speaking engagement about his latest books -- one of them titled \"The Virus of Faith.\" He has written seven books in all. As he walked back from the book fair, assailants plunged machetes and knives into Roy and his wife, killing him and leaving her bloodied and missing a finger. Afterward, an Islamist group \"Ansar Bangla-7\" reportedly tweeted, \"Target Down here in Bangladesh.\" Investigators are proceeding on the notion that Roy's murder was an extremist attack. His father, Ajay Roy, filed a case of murder with the Shahbagh police Friday without naming suspects. No one came to their aid as they were hacked down, a witness said. \"I shouted for help from the people but nobody came to save him.\" But at night, secularist sympathizers marched through a street holding torches; by day, others held a sit-in to protest Roy's killing. The government condemned the attack. Who was the software engineer, a U.S. citizen from Alpharetta, Georgia, who drew such rage from some and adoration from others? Software was his career, but writing and blogging were his calling. And he did not speak alone. Roy founded the religion critical blog Mukto Mona, which served multiple writers. He called it \"an Internet congregation of freethinkers, rationalists, skeptics, atheists and humanists mainly of Bengali and South Asian descent who are scattered across the globe.\" Its mission was to promote science, secular philosophy, democracy and religious tolerance in articles by academics and activists. Its headers contain quotes by famous scientists, including one attributed to Albert Einstein condemning the doctrine of heaven and hell as a means of enforcing ethics: . \"A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary.\" To the most devout and to extremists, Roy's criticisms amounted to blasphemy. He took aim at the sentiment in a blog post headlined,  \"Happy Blasphemy Day, Happy Birthday 'Mukto Mona.'\" Some who felt oppressed by religion said he spoke for them. \"Avijit Roy, your voice of reason and your passion for free thinking will never die. You were a voice to so many voiceless,\" a fan wrote after his death. Very. Roy and the blog's other critics took off the gloves when it came to religion, particularly Islam. Roy was a fan of Bill Maher's harsh reproach of Islam and a critic of Reza Aslan, who has countered Maher's  standpoint. His blog called Aslan \"an Islamic apologist, who obviously feels threatened by the growing Atheist movement in the U.S. and worldwide.\" Roy likened women in burkas to \"living zombies,\" tweeting out a cartoon of one standing next to a child dressed as a ghost for Halloween. Yes. He began one of his final articles by writing that January's Charlie Hebdo massacre in France was \"a tragic atrocity committed by soldiers of the so-called religion of peace.\" He doled out scathing criticism after another Bangladeshi blogger was hacked to death outside his home in 2013 by assailants with machetes. \"The virus of faith was the weapon that made these atrocities possible,\" Roy wrote. But he also criticized Christianity. \"So, Pope Francis thinks 'evolution is real'! And it is still a major headline news in this century,\" he recently tweeted. To Roy, God was an outdated notion. Roy sought enlightenment in doubt, criticism and reason. Question everything, was a theme in his online posts. Never think you've found the truth. He was a science geek who admired Charles Darwin, evolutionary psychology and astrophysics, according to a Facebook account in his name. CNN could not independently verify it belongs to him. Roy was a fan of \"Cosmos,\" the TV series explaining the science behind the origin of the universe, and of the geek sitcom \"The Big Bang Theory.\" Mukto Mona contains sections titled \"Science\" and \"Rationalism,\" but most of the articles hold science up to religion as a litmus test, which it invariably fails. \"To me, it is a rational concept to oppose any unscientific and irrational belief,\" Roy said. That's likely. He regularly attended a February book fair in the Bangladeshi capital, and last year, after he launched \"The Virus of Faith,\" the death threats began streaming in. They landed in his email inbox and cropped up on social media. \"A well-known extremist ... openly issued death threats to me through his numerous Facebook statuses,\" Roy wrote. His book \"hit the cranial nerve of Islamic fundamentalists,\" Roy wrote. After the Charlie Hebdo attacks, an online Bangladeshi bookstore pulled it after extremists put pressure on it. But is seemed the author was safe in Alpharetta. \"Avijit Roy lives in America and so, it is not possible to kill him right now. But he will be murdered when he comes back,\" the Islamist wrote, according to Roy. He couldn't let that stop him, Roy's friend Michael De Dora said. \"Avijit was very idealistic,\" he said. \"His understanding was that he wouldn't be killed, that if anyone ever tried to attack him or hated him, that they could just kind of have a chat and he would convince them ... that they could at least have a dialogue.\" He never had a chance to. They attacked from behind. CNN's Ray Sanchez, Lonzo Cook, Greg Botelho, Farid Ahmed and John Couwels contributed to this report.","highlights":"Roy yearned for an age of reason without religious dogma .\nIslamist extremists resented him, threatened to kill him ."}

{"article":"Wasps director of rugby Dai Young described Saracens as a unique team to play against after his side lost a crucial Premiership match at the Ricoh Arena. Brilliant tries from Christian Wade and Elliot Daly, with two conversions and a penalty from Andy Goode, had seen Wasps build up a 17-3 lead after the first 20 minutes. But after that the Saracens pack became the dominant force with Richard Wigglesworth and Alex Goode controlling matters at half-back.

Wasps director or rugby Dai Young believes his side can still make the play-offs at the end of the season . Nathan Hughes surges forward with the ball for Wasps during the Aviva Premiership match with Saracens . Wasps had stormed into a 17-3 lead through tries from Elliot Daly (right) \u00a0and Christian Wade . 'We knew what was coming from (them) as they don't play a lot of rugby, (they) kick the ball a lot to squeeze you and it's very hard to play against. 'If you can control it, you get options to play as we showed in the first 20 minutes but after that we struggled to deal with the aerial bombardment as we dropped the ball far too often.' Despite the loss, which was a huge blow to Wasps' chances of making the play-offs, Young was adamant that his team were moving forward. 'Nothing changes as a result of today, we are still a work in progress and we are still aiming for a place in the top six.

He said: 'We had the clarity of thought not to be spooked when they scored two tries in three minutes as we put the ball in the right areas to put pressure on them. 'You can see that they have people who can hurt you from long range as they've scored a lot of tries from inside their own half this season. 'We had chances to close it up late on, which we didn't take, but we did deprive them of a vital bonus point.' The only downside for the Saracens was the loss of Brad Barritt, who limped off in the second half following a heavy collision with Andy Goode.

The frustrated administrators of Invercargill's Splash Palace complex have lost thousands of dollars of business cleaning up after a patron's foul play, stuff.co.nz reported. One evening was particularly disastrous, with managers having to close three different pools as those responsible leap-frogged from one pool to another. Splash Palace, pictured, describes itself as one of New Zealand's premier pools. Unfortunately, a so-called 'mystery pooper' has reportedly soiled the waters five times, requiring six hours of cleaning . Manager Pete Thompson told Fairfax: 'They did one in the leisure pool and we moved the kids to the learners' pool, and they did one in the learners' pool and we moved the kids to the main pool, and one appeared in the main pool, so we had to shut the whole thing down. 'In one of those pools was diarrhoea ... that was unfortunate.' Mr Thompson said the incidents occurred after 5pm on Friday evenings. It is unclear whether one person or more is behind the incident, with a local councillor quoted saying: 'We have a mystery pooper'. It won't help Invercargill's sometimes battered reputation.

{"article":"(CNN)What does it take to help a single dolphin entangled in fishing line? In the recent case of a dolphin calf rescued off the eastern coast of Florida, about two days of effort involving seven boats and 35 people from 12 institutions and organizations. And that was after four weeks spent finding him and evaluating his situation to see whether it warranted intervention. With spring approaching, marine experts say it's a good reminder to look after your belongings when you take to the water. From plastic bags to swimming trunks to crab pots, marine life can get entangled in all manner of human debris. With limited time and resources, experts can't save them all. \"You really want to make sure you keep all your hands on your stuff,\" said Elizabeth Stratton, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries' assistant marine mammal stranding coordinator for the southeast region. \"We feel a special responsibility in cases where an animal's health is in danger because of debris introduced by humans,\" said Stratton, who was involved in last week's rescue. So where does an intervention begin? A couple spotted the calf off the coast of Fort Pierce with monofilament line wrapped around his rostrum, or snout. The mammal was riding the wake of their boat. They reported it January 18 to the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, which set out to find the calf and his mother. The group found the pair and took more pictures, which were sent to the NOAA Fisheries on February 9 for evaluation. The photos revealed monofilament line wrapped around the calf's upper jaw, cutting into the tissue to the bone, threatening his ability to eat or possibly leading to infection. Veterinarians who reviewed the photos deemed the injuries potentially life-threatening. \"We can't disentangle every animal,\" Stratton said, \"but If it comes back as life-threatening, we mobilize to do disentanglement.\" The next step was to find the creatures again. Through characteristics on the mother's dorsal fin, the group was able to identify her through records on file and target her home range for a search. After a two-day search, the group found the dolphins on Friday and approached for intervention. The process took about an hour, from netting the calf and his mother to sending them on their way, Stratton said. Apart from the fishing line both mother and son were in good condition. Rescuers gave the calf a long-lasting antibiotic and radio-tagged the mother before releasing them to the ocean \"where they belong,\" Stratton said. The moral of the story for humans: \"Be conscious of your gear.\" To report an injured marine mammal, call 877-WHALEHELP (877-942-5343).","highlights":"It took about four weeks and an hour for rescuers to help a dolphin calf .\nFishing line was wrapped around its rostrum .\nDolphin was rescued off the eastern coast of Florida ."}

{"article":"A temporary order by a Superior Court judge is keeping a man from smoking inside his home in the District of Columbia - even though it's completely legal. WJLA-TV\u00a0reports that Edwin Gray's next door neighbors in northeast Washington have filed a civil suit claiming they're being harmed by smoke that sneaks into their home through a hole in the basement. The family moved into the home next to Gray last year and have one child, and another on the way. No smoking zone: Edwin Gray has been ordered not to smoke inside his home, which his family has owned for the past 50 years . Complaints: The temporary injunction was ordered by a Superior Court judge after one of Gray's neighbors in northeast Washington, DC filed a lawsuit saying smoke was leaking into their home . A judge issued a temporary injunction last week saying neither Gray nor any family or guests may smoke in the home the family has owned for 50 years. The family has vowed to fight the order. In court filings and a statement, the neighbors say they tried to work with Gray and his sister Mozella Johnson, but that the mediation attempts failed and they decided to file the suit. 'You want me to stop what I've been doing in my house, all my life,' Gray remarked. In addition to seeking an injunction on smoking at the house, the neighbors are also asking for $500,000 in damages. The lawsuit does set a precedent for other complaints in the DC area.

{"article":"(CNN)Around the world, parents are navigating deep, uncharted emotional waters after a young man decided to leave a band. Yes, Zayn Malik has quit One Direction. For parents bewildered by the sudden outpouring of grief, here are a few facts to use as anchors in the sea of despair. Malik left the band. He didn't die. He wasn't thrown out. He quit, because he's young and didn't want to do it any more. \"I am leaving because I want to be a normal 22-year old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight,\" he said in a statement posted on the band's Facebook page. Sound fair enough? In the world of One Direction fans, ABSOLUTELY NOT! A few more facts for emotional ballast: The band is staying together. The other four will continue to tour and make records and even work on their fifth album this year, the statement said. So, now that the facts are out there, how do parents cope with what may seem to be a completely over-the-top irrational response to a small change in line-up? Never, ever, underestimate the depths of adolescent emotion. \"Teenagers are wired to feel emotional and to feel almost obsessive about things, and passionate and impulsive. So it makes sense biologically that they are this entrenched in 1D,\" says Dannielle Miller, an author and teen girl educator. After the loss of Malik, Miller says many teenagers are coping with a sense of loss they've never felt before. To them, it is real, and incredibly painful. \"The last thing you want to do as a parent is to just think it's silly and to laugh at your child if she's really upset about this because her feelings will be very real to her,\" Miller says. (Or him, as the case may be). \"If you choose to laugh at her or tease her about it, then she's not going to tell you when she's grieving about other things in her life that she's really struggling with.\" Arm yourself with some tissues and take a step back, advises child psychologist Dr. Louise Porter. \"A parent's job is to understand that they're sad, even if we don't understand why. If we think it's an over-the-top reaction for the circumstances, that doesn't matter,\" says Porter. She advises against trying to placate and console. \"You don't need to console, you don't need to give advice. There was a famous communicator by the name of Marshall Rosenberg who said 'don't just do something, stand there.' They just need us to hear the message that says 'you're sad.'\" There's some scary stuff out there, not least the Twitter hashtag #cut4zayn or #cutforzayn. Fans are posting images of slashed arms, as a sign of devotion or warped attempt to pressure Zayn to change his mind. In one instance, a user posted a photo that appeared to show the bloodied words \"I LOVE ZAYN\" etched on his or her arm. There's a precedent, Miller says. In 2013, a similar hashtag started that urged fans to \"cut for Bieber,\" after reports that singer Justin Bieber was caught smoking marijuana. \"A lot of those pictures were since proven to be hoaxes, so a similar thing could be happening here now,\" Miller says. \"But regardless, the reality is lots of teen girls do think that these pictures are real and are sharing them.\" Miller says seeing images of self-harm could encourage vulnerable girls to do the same. \"As a parent it's really concerning because images of people self-harming can be quite triggering,\" she says. Look for signs of self-harm. Your child might start wearing clothes that deliberately cover their arms and legs, or become especially withdrawn. Miller advises parents to ask the children outright: Are you hurting yourself? \"There's nothing wrong with being quite direct about it,\" she says. \"Early intervention is always great because then she needs to learn a healthier way of dealing with stress.\" The Internet is awash with melodrama on the issue of Zayn and what next for One Direction. Girls are sobbing on Vine videos, while on Twitter fans are competing to express the extent of their grief. Experts say it's not necessarily a good idea to slap an outright ban on the Internet, no matter how strongly you feel about its negative influence. \"The parent needs to ask the child is it better to be on the net or is it better to be off?\" say Porter. \"It's better to distance yourself from it at times when it's feeling overwhelming, and dip back into it as you need to, to touch base with other people.\" Miller advises clearly explaining to the child why it would be better not to log on. \"Explain why, don't get cross at them. They're not doing anything wrong. They're grieving with what they see as their tribe.\" But she adds: \"What you're seeing on there is a feeding frenzy of grief which really isn't helpful.\" She suggests offering to replay a One Direction concert, or if the pain is still too raw, go for a walk or do something else. The good news for parents is that the trauma should subside after a couple of days. And if it takes longer? \"You don't want to rush children but if it's going on for a couple of days, you might say, \"passively coping and just being sad probably isn't going to work for you in this or in life in general so what can you do to make yourself feel better,\" Porter says. Miller says for many teens, the partial break-up of One Direction signals an end of an era. But she says if the grieving goes on for longer than a couple of days it may be advisable to talk further and perhaps seek external help. Right now, grieving One Direction fans may not want to hear it, but for parents Malik's departure offers a great opportunity to teach an important life lesson. \"This is quite a nice introduction to grief,\" says Porter, pointing out that the vast majority of Malik's fans don't know their idol. And after all, he hasn't died. Miller agrees. \"For parents, this is an incredible opportunity to show your child how to be more resilient.\" \"In doing this now, in what is really distant from them, then you're giving them a wonderful scaffold to fall back on when in the real world someone leaves them or breaks their heart. We all need to learn that skill,\" she says. Look for the silver lining. Miller says Malik has set a great example for his fans by choosing his personal happiness over fame, success and money. \"That's something they should admire him for,\" Miller says. She suggests asking your child to tell you what other positive outcomes might come from this. A brilliant solo career? A happier Zayn? 1. Encourage teens to have a good cry. 2. Encourage them to self-talk themselves through this. \"He hasn't died. So what might happen to Zayn next? What could happen to the band next. Could there be a great solo album out of this? Get them thinking in a more positive frame of mind,\" Miller says. 3. Get them moving. \"Sitting in their room on the computer watching other kids cut themselves and talk about the end of the world is not helpful.\" 4. Encourage them to share how they're feeling with you and to be honest with you so you can check that they're coping. 5. Encourage them to not spend too much time online. And through all that remember, in the wise words of Malik: \"It was 5 great years.\"","highlights":"Zayn Malik is leaving One Direction to be a \"normal 22-year old\"\nGrief-stricken fans express their devastation online .\nExperts: Great opportunity for parents to teach their children resilience ."}
{"article":"(CNN)The sack and pillage of the Mosul museum by the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria displayed a violence rarely seen since the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamyian. The bulldozing of the archaeological site of Nimrud marked a new step in the cultural cleansing underway in Iraq. These acts are a deliberate attack against civilians, minorities, heritage sites and traditions. In the minds of terrorists, murder and destruction of culture are inherently linked. It is appalling to see the ravages of this violent extremism in a region that is a cradle of civilization, whose temples, palaces and frescoes have born witness to the glory of Iraq and Mesopotamia for the last 3,000 years. It is important we understand the true nature of this conflict. This war against culture is a war against people. It is part of a strategy to crush free thinking and to ensure domination through oppression. This is why extremists attack schools, media, or other places of culture. Through modern methods of communication and information, they use warped learning and distorted academic texts to hijack young minds. They forbid girls to go to school, kill journalists and vandalize museums: all symbols that embody freedom of thought and respect for cultural diversity. There can be no justification whatsoever for the systematic destruction of the heritage of humanity, and I wholeheartedly support the many religious leaders who have taken such a firm position denouncing these destructions and the perverted use of religion. When culture is under attack, we must respond with more knowledge, and with ever greater effort to work to explain the importance of humanity's shared heritage. This is why we appeal to all cultural institutions, museums, journalists, professors, and scientists to share knowledge widely about the Mesopotamian civilization. We need to remind \u200eall of the history of this land which led the Islamic golden age. And we also call on all people everywhere -- and especially youth, in Iraq and elsewhere -- to claim this heritage as their own. Pre-Islamic heritage in Iraq belongs to all Iraqis, just as the Pyramids are written into the identity of all Egyptians. What is happening goes far beyond the domain of archaeologists and discourse on the \"irreparable loss of treasures of humanity.\" What is happening is a security issue. The deliberate destruction of cultural heritage is a war crime. We see how terrorists are using such destruction to destabilize populations, spread terror, and encourage violence. We see also how extremists use heavy military vehicles to transport artifacts from looted\u200e\u00a0sites, and how illicit trafficking is directly funding terrorism. With this in mind, we have joined forces with all partners and neighboring countries to halt these crimes. The acceleration of such violence must be met with an acceleration of global solidarity and action. Faced with such crimes, we hope we can better understand the values we all share, and stand united in respect of humanity.","highlights":"ISIS bulldozed site of ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq .\nIrina Bokova: Appalling to see the ravages of this violent extremism ."}

Recordings of fans at Manchester United and Manchester City chanting and shouting abuse at Carneiro were broadcast by the BBC on Thursday night, prompting the Blues to call for an end to sexism in football. A spokesman for the Premier League leaders told the Guardian: 'The issue of equality is one we take extremely seriously and we abhor discrimination in all its forms, including sexism. Such behaviour is unacceptable and we want it eradicated from the game.' Recordings of fans at Manchester United and Manchester City were shown on BBC on Thursday night . Abuse was directed at Chelsea club doctor Eva Carneiro by opposition fans on seperate occasions . Chelsea have called for an end to sexism in football after fans directed abuse at their club doctor . FA board member Heather Rabbatts described the abuse as 'horrible' and urged supporters to notify officials if they witness such behaviour, telling the BBC: 'We are absolutely encouraging people to report incidents like this.' Campaign group Women in Football is launching an anti-sexism social media drive on Friday and has also contacted all 92 Premier League and Football League clubs asking them to champion female members of staff in their matchday programmes ahead of International Women's Day on March 8. Minister for Sport Helen Grant is supporting the initiative. She said: 'It is absolutely right that we champion and celebrate women who work in the football industry and play vital roles in making the game the success that it is. 'I want more women to get involved in football across the board and to see it as a great industry to work in. Sexism, in any shape or form, should not be tolerated so I applaud this push to encourage people to report any incidents of sexist abuse and for the promotion of inclusivity across football.' The incidents come after a study by anti-discrimination group Kick It Out revealed that 13 reports of sexism in English professional and grassroots football were made in the first half of the current season (August-December 2014). Kick It Out went on to reveal that two sexism complaints were made during the 2013-14 season.

{"article":"Jerusalem (CNN)A newly released ISIS video shows a child shooting a man the group claims is an Israeli spy. The video identifies the man as 19-year-old Mohamed Said Ismail Musallam, an Israeli citizen of Palestinian descent. In the video, ISIS shows Musallam's Israeli passport and claims he's an agent sent to infiltrate the group. The 19-year-old's family told CNN Tuesday that he had no ties with the Mossad, Israel's spy agency, and had, in fact, been recruited by ISIS. \"Mohamed told me and his brother that ISIS took him,\" according to Said Musallam, his father. \"They sent him money through the Western Union. They said you will have girls, money, cars, villas, paradise, but afterwords he discovered that there is nothing.\" It wasn't long before Musallam's family members didn't recognize him when they talked to him on Skype. The man they knew as a kind and funny brother and son who was once a volunteer firefighter had grown a long beard and was carrying a rifle. His father tried to help him get home, sending him money and even enlisting the Red Cross. But his son never made it back to Israel. About a month ago, Said Musallam said, he was told his son was taken by ISIS when he was on his way back and trying to cross the border. A video posted Tuesday on ISIS-affiliated social media accounts shows a man who appears to be Musallam on his knees, wearing an orange jumpsuit. An adult ISIS fighter and a child -- both in fatigues -- stand behind him. The adult, speaking French, gives a command to the child to go forward with the killing. The child steps in front of the man and raises what appears to be a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and shoots Musallam in the forehead. The man immediately falls forward to the ground. The child appears to then fire at least two more shots into the body. Ahmad Musallam said he'd seen the video of his brother and was devastated by his death. \"I used to take care of him and babysit him when Mom went to work,\" he said, crying. \"Mohamed is not a brother. He is a son.\" But he refuses to show the video to his parents, who still can't believe their son is dead. An issue last month of ISIS' English-language propaganda magazine, Dabiq, included a purported interview with Musallam and described his alleged work for the Israeli spy agency. In the ISIS video, Musallam seems to be reading what appears to be a prepared confession, saying he is an Israeli intelligence agent working for Mossad, sent to infiltrate ISIS. Musallam's family members said they believe he was coerced in the video, forced to lie about ties to Israeli intelligence. \"Mohamed is not an agent. Mohamed  doesn't have a shekel. If he was an agent he would have lived a beautiful life,\" his mother, Hind Musallam, said. \"We could have been living a different life and I would not be working cleaning houses so we can live.\" This isn't the first time ISIS has used children to drive home its message. An ISIS propaganda video released in January -- one that CNN could not independently verify -- shows a boy with a pistol apparently shooting two men in the back of the head. The boy then stands over one of the bodies, fires two more times, and later raises his pistol high. Last August, a photo posted to Twitter from an ISIS stronghold showed a 7-year-old boy holding a man's severed head and his father's words, \"That's my boy.\" ISIS has featured children as fighters before, calling them the \"cubs of the caliphate\" (the adult jihadis call each other \"lions\") and has encouraged foreign fighters to bring their families. It has taken over schools to indoctrinate children. Human Rights Watch says ISIS and other extremist groups \"have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks, including suicide bombing missions.\" CNN's Stefan Simons, Cynde Strand, Ben Wedeman, Kevin Flower, Catherine E. Shoichet, Faith Karimi, Greg Botelho and Jessica King contributed to this report.","highlights":"A video claims to show the killing of Mohamed Said Ismail Musallam .\nMusallam's family says ISIS recruited him .\nISIS claims the 19-year-old is an Israeli spy ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Five Muslim women stand tall in a boxing ring, slowly winding strapping around their hands. A spotlight is trained on them and the audience draws close, hanging on their every word. \"How can we be truthful if we have to hide out of shame, feel humiliated for feeling, for saying, doing, thinking as we please? How can that be freedom, how can that be truth?\" Performed at Southbank Centre's WOW -- Women of the World Festival -- Common Wealth Theatre's \"No Guts, No Heart, No Glory,\" tells the true story of Muslim female boxers from Bradford in the north of England, and how they are using the sport to transcend religious and gender barriers. The critically acclaimed show -- in which the women stamp, dance, shout, swear, punch, and even crowd surf -- was partly inspired by Ambreen Sadiq, a former UK national champion, and one of Britain's first Muslim female boxers. Her journey to success wasn't easy -- as a victim of bullying at the age of 13 she found respite in boxing after being introduced to it by her father and brother. \"I got bullied quite a lot growing up, my dad's Pakistani and my mum's Portuguese,\" Sadiq told CNN. \"I got stick from both sides, from white and black people. I felt like I wasn't accepted. I used to move schools so many times just to feel accepted. \"People would stay stuff about how I looked... everyone said that's a boy's sport, what are you doing that for? You're going to look like a man, like a transsexual. \"I was bullied from such a young age, I felt like it was never going to stop. Boxing helped me to control that anger.\" It was a transformative experience for Sadiq -- she went from being quiet, having few friends and getting into fights to plucking up courage to start conversations, and thereby build self confidence. \"Instead of punching someone in the face I'd punch the bag,\" she added. \"If anyone came up to me and said anything I could just walk away from it -- whereas before I'd just straight punch them in the face or something. So it's helped me a lot with discipline.\" It's sometimes hard to imagine Sadiq as a boxer -- her movements are calm and assured, and a kind smile is never far from her lips. \"Boxing has made me the person I am today, and I'm so proud of the person I am,\" said the 20-year-old trailblazer, who is now looked up to by girls from all kinds of communities wanting to follow in her footsteps. \"I've had a lot of girls -- not just Asian girls -- coming up to me and asking, how do you stop people saying it's a boy's sport? How can you convince your parents to let you box?\" While boxing for many is just a sport -- albeit a violent one -- when it comes to women and Muslims participating it can feel more like a cause, with Sadiq often finding herself explaining her motivation to girls. \"What's the difference if a boy boxes or if a girl boxes? When we're in that ring we look like boxers -- we don't look like a girl or a boy. \"You come into that gym, you come into that show, you come into that ring thinking I'm a boxer, not that I'm a girl or I'm a boy.\" The role of Nicola Adams -- the first ever female boxer to win an Olympic gold medal -- has also been key in the fight for acceptance. Sadiq tells the story of how several years ago her coach Alwyn Belcher, who also worked with Adams, originally refused to train women -- that is, until he turned up to coach the GB team (believing they'd be men) only to find an enthusiastic bunch of women ready to work. \"That's the day he met Nicola Adams,\" recalls Sadiq with a laugh. \"He said from that day he thought girls were better boxers -- because they like to listen.\" Since Adams' success at the Olympic Games, females boxing once a week increased by 79% according to a 2013 Sport England study, but even the production of \"No Guts, No Heart, No Glory\" highlighted the barriers women potentially face. Cast member and aspiring medical student Freyaa Ali said there was a girl who had wanted to participate in the show, but was ultimately prevented from doing so by her relatives. \"It wasn't even the boxing and it wasn't even the speech, it was the dancing we do in the ring. I'm incredibly lucky to be able to do this, and I was just so sad for her. You know there are certain women out there who can't do what we're doing right now.\" \"I think that's what makes me even more passionate about doing this -- we want to give them a voice and give them a reason, so they know they can have confidence to do stuff like this.\" If women do feel restricted by their religion or gender, Ali urged them to take things step by step. \"Go for it, just go for it. I think maybe talk to your parents first, and just tell them Mum, Dad, this is what I want to do, I want to box, I want to dance, I want to act, or whatever she wants to do. \"Tell them, you know what? Its OK what I'm doing, I'm not going to be going out of my boundaries and doing bad things, I'm going to stick to my limits and stick to my religion, it's not harming anyone. \"My parents would say, if you're happy, we're happy. I think anyone's parents would say that wouldn't they? \"The first step is trying it and opening that door. Once you can open it an inch you can open it a mile.\"","highlights":"\"No Guts, No Heart, No Glory\" is a play by Common Wealth Theatre that tells the true story of Muslim female boxers .\nThe performance was partly inspired by former UK national champion Ambreen Sadiq who experienced bullying and discrimination .\n\"We want to give them a voice and give them a reason, so they know they can have confidence\" says cast member Freyaa Ali about girls in boxing ."}
{"article":"Los Angeles (CNN)Former rap mogul Marion \"Suge\" Knight collapsed in court Friday shortly after a judge set his bail at $25 million in a murder case, an amount  Knight's attorney said was excessively high. The attorney earlier indicated such a bail was probably higher than his client could post. Knight bent over in his chair at the defense table, with his attorney beside him, and two deputies rushed to him as he was facedown. Moments earlier, the judge ruled that Knight \"has a great potential to flee and apparently has so in the past.\" \"In this court's opinion, $25 million is reasonable, and it is so set,\" said Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen. Attorney Matthew Fletcher told CNN affiliate KABC that Knight hit his head on a chair and knocked himself out. Fletcher later saw Knight in the holding cell, and \"he was dripping sweat ... like somebody threw a bucket of water on him,\" Fletcher told the station. \"And he wiped the sweat off his head and said, 'I haven't had my medication,' and I said since when, and he said since yesterday. That's when I went back in and told the judge 'You need to make an order that he gets his medicine and he hasn't been fed' and the judge said, 'Well, they offered him food at some point today,' and I said well that's not what I've heard,\" Fletcher told the affiliate. Knight, who suffers from diabetes and blood clots, was taken to the hospital, the attorney said. Knight's condition was not immediately available. He has collapsed before while in custody. Knight has been held in solitary confinement, Fletcher added. When asked about the $25 million bail, Fletcher said, \"It's just laughable.\" The bail in other prominent murder cases \"at most is $5 million,\" Fletcher told the affiliate. \"The heads of the Mafia, $5 million (bail),\" Fletcher said. Prosecutors sought the $25 million bail, he added. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for April 13. Knight, 49, has pleaded not guilty to several charges that accuse him of running over two men -- killing one of them -- in January after an argument. Knight is charged with one count of murder, one count of attempted murder and two counts of hit-and-run, with an allegation that he committed a serious and violent felony while out on bail, prosecutors said. The man who died was Terry Carter, 55, a former rap record label owner. The second man is Cle \"Bone\" Sloan, 51. The deadly incident happened on January 29, after a flare-up on the set of the biopic \"Straight Outta Compton,\" a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group N.W.A. The argument spilled over to the parking lot of Tam's Burgers in Compton. The incident is the latest run-in with the law for Knight, who founded the wildly successful Death Row Records in 1991 and signed artists such as Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur. Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers, and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. In August, Knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards. At the time of his most recent arrest, Knight was free on bail in a robbery case. CNN's Rosalina Nieves, Paul Vercammen, Carma Hassan and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","highlights":"\"It's just laughable,\" Knight's attorney says about high bail .\nKnight is taken to hospital, but his condition is not available, attorney says ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Golden beaches and grand hotels can all be found in Mauritius, but there is much more to this island paradise. The country, located some 500 miles east of Madagascar, has been attracting global investors for decades. But there is also a healthy local appetite for business development -- one of the many reasons the country has been hailed as an African success story. One company demonstrating this entrepreneurial drive is fresh food suppliers SKC Surat. \"My father Sooklall Surat, started as a farmer with one hectare of land,\" says Suren Surat, who is now CEO of the company his father founded sixty years ago. \"The land was next to our house, where we lived. My father was the first grower at that time, the pioneer for growing strawberries and artichokes in Mauritius.\" Suren Surat has been part of the company from the beginning. The family had enough offspring to start a cricket squad, but the team dedicated its efforts towards business success. As a kid, Surat would get up early to help his father on the small farm before going to school. \"Whatever he was growing, people were coming to buy in our garden, wholesale...So my father decided to go retail,\" Surat remembers. Shift to retail . The family's first stall was in Curepipe market in the country's highest town. It was here, not far from the famous extinct volcanic crater \"Trou aux Cerfs\", that the family business started to really grow. Lychees, pineapple and mangoes all bloom in Mauritius' tropical climate, but the weather stops oranges, apples, and plums from sprouting. When Sooklall Surat started importing foreign fruit, others followed suit. Import\/Export . Sooklall's brother Shyam focused on selling fresh produce from abroad, attracting customers with foreign tastes. He built a busy operation, but the fast flow of goods didn't stop the family monitoring the fruits and vegetables. \"We say you need to be able to talk to the fresh produce -- this is the success of the business,\" says Suren Surat. 'Work is work' Estimates say the Mauritian economy grew by 3.5% in 2014 and will top 4% in 2015 -- impressive statistics in a country which the World Bank says does a better job of supporting business than Japan, France and Spain. In such a competitive market, guts, good relations and hard work are essential.  Suren says that the business keeps the family together, with different members taking control of areas like import and distribution. \"We've seen many local companies, Mauritius companies, who are family business who split,\" says Suren Surat. \"But luckily I have to say our grandparents, our mother, father have taught us how to manage.\" The company's next leaders will have to do more than manage the fresh produce. Recently, the family started the islands' first dairy, and is soon to open its sixth supermarket franchise. It's all part of the strategy to keep things fresh on the island that is home to over 1.3 million people. \"The future is very very important,\" says Shyam Surat. \"I would advise any people, mainly in Africa or this part of the islands, to grow more fruit and veggies.

{"article":"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN)Police have arrested more than 500 parents in and around the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar for not allowing their children to get the polio vaccine, an official said Tuesday. Peshawar Deputy Commissioner Riaz Khan Mehsud told CNN that the 513 arrests took place Monday and Tuesday as part of a government campaign to administer polio vaccines in parts of Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Those arrested will be released on bail if they sign an affidavit stating that they will let their children get vaccinated, according to the deputy commissioner. Pakistan's vaccination rate is inordinately low for a number of reasons, including attacks on medical workers, the displacement of people due to ongoing military operations and a lack of trust by some families. Whatever the reason, the fact that a large number of children are not immunized is having an impact. Such vaccines are credited with wiping out polio in most parts of the world. But Pakistan is an exception, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, a public-private partnership that includes the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). The South Asian nation leads all others in new polio cases in recent years, and has nine of this year's 10 reported cases. In 2014, Pakistan had 327 cases. The next closest country was Nigeria, with 36 cases. Authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province hope to ensure that 2.7 million children there get vaccine drops. They've learned about more than 13,000 cases in which parents have not done so since a provincial campaign began two weeks ago, Mehsud said. Dr. Bilal Ahmad, a UNICEF team leader based in Pakistan, called authorities' unprecedented move a last-ditch effort to clear polio from \"cluster\" zones where large numbers of families have refused to get their children vaccinated. \"First the workers (try to) convince them, then their supervisors, then senior members of the community,\" Ahmad said. \"(This government action) is the final step in eradicating this issue.\" Polio is a highly infectious viral disease that primarily affects young children, sometimes leading to paralysis and death. The virus is easily preventable through immunization, but there's no cure once it is contracted. It went from being a health issue to a security issue after U.S. intelligence officials used a vaccination program to help in their hunt for Osama bin Laden in 2011. Under cover of the program, the CIA sought to collect DNA samples from relatives of the al Qaeda leader to verify his presence in a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. CIA policy: Won't use vaccination programs as part of operations . Those administering the vaccines have become targets, with the National Emergency Operations Center reporting that more than 70 medical workers have been killed in attacks since December 2012. And in June 2012, Pakistani Taliban commander Hafiz Gul Bahadur announced that polio vaccines would be banned in another Pakistani province -- North Waziristan -- because of drone strikes there. Bahadur called the strikes \"worse than polio.\" CNN's Sophia Saifi reported from Islamabad, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this report from Atlanta.","highlights":"Official: Parents who sign affidavit vowing to vaccinate their children will be released .\nPakistan has more new polio cases than any other country .\nMilitants have targeted health workers administering vaccines for years ."}

{"article":"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)Oversized military trucks painted in desert beige hauled tanks in the same camouflage color down a dark highway late Saturday past glowing billboards in the Saudi Arabian town of Jazan. With the border with Yemen little more than 20 miles away, the trucks captured on a video distributed by the news agency Reuters also carried a message: Suggestions of a ground incursion into Yemen, which is in the throes of a Houthi rebel uprising, may be more than just talk. Saudi Arabia and Egypt have both spoken about the possibility of putting boots on the ground before. And on Saturday, Yemeni Foreign Minister Riyadh Yaseen said he expected coalition troops to be in Yemen within days. Saudi leaders have said that if troops do go in, they won't leave until they have degraded the Houthis' ability to do battle, CNN's Ian Lee reported. The Houthis are apt guerrillas. A fight on the ground could prove bloody and lengthy. Politically, the situation appears to be heating up. Ahmed Ali Abdullah Saleh, the son of former Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh, has been removed from his post as ambassador to United Arab Emirates, according to two aides of the nation's current President, Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. Hadi fled the country in February amid the Houthi uprising. He went to Aden and declared that he remained the country's leader. Also on Sunday, pro-Hadi fighters took over Aden's airport, according to security officials in Aden, but that airport hasn't been operational for weeks. Yemen's ex-president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, a Shiite, still holds influence over large parts of the Yemeni army, and his troops are also fighting the government. In a taped speech played on Yemen Today TV on Friday, he called for the airstrikes to stop and offered in return not to run for president in the next elections. The Saudi-led coalition fighting the Shiite Houthis, who deposed the Yemeni government and seized territory in a series of offensives, began its military action last week. It answered Hadi's call for intervention with an unrelenting air campaign called \"Decisive Storm.\" Hadi slipped out of Yemen last week and has gone to the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, to attend the Arab League summit, where he is rallying support with leaders of member nations for operation Determination Storm. Support is already broad. The coalition nations participating in the bombardments make up about a third of the league's membership. On Saturday, Hadi called the Houthis out: \"You violated the sovereignty (of Yemen), and you bear the responsibility for what happened and what is going to happen.\" Dozens have died from the coalition bombardment. Houthi commanders put the death toll at 48. Most of the dead are civilians, they said. Airstrikes have hit Houthi militant groups, smashed their big air defense guns and crumbled key infrastructure that links major towns with the capital, Sanaa, a Saudi official has said. The coalition has destroyed Yemeni army weapons caches and military facilities. Saudi naval special forces have also rescued dozens of diplomats, the official said. And many U.N. representatives have fled the unrest. Saudi Arabia has set up a blockade, effectively cutting off Houthi supply lines, and its air force controls Yemeni airspace. They have threatened to attack ships that might supply the rebels. The Shiite Houthis are allied with Iran, a majority Shiite nation. Saudi Arabia has accused Iran of beefing up the Houthis' weaponry for their offensive. Hadi denounced them on Saturday as Iran's \"puppet.\" \"I say to the puppet of Iran, and those who are with him, you destroyed Yemen with your immature politics, and creating internal and regional crisis,\" he said. The conflict splits the region along religious lines. Determination Storm's coalition comprises the majority Sunni nations of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Jordan, Morocco, Egypt and Sudan. On Saturday, Houthis claimed to have shot down a Sudanese jet and captured the pilot. They distributed photos of a pilot and wreckage to back up the claim. Iran and Saudi Arabia are bitter rivals. Having Yemen become an Iranian satellite country on its border would be unacceptable to the kingdom. Iran has sharply denounced the Saudi-dominated armed intervention. And two Arab League members, Lebanon and Iraq, have voiced opposition to Determination Storm, Lee reported. Both countries are majority Shiite. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pointed to Yemen on Sunday to criticize nuclear negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 group of nations. He accused Iran of trying to use the conflict in Yemen to \"take over the whole Middle East.\" The United States voiced approval of the airstrikes. It's supporting them logistically and aiding coalition forces in locating targets, but it is not participating in active battle. The unrest in Yemen led to the withdrawal of U.S. special forces earlier this month, seriously undermining counterterrorism efforts in a country that has been a stronghold for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). For years, Yemen had allowed U.S. drones and special operations forces to stalk AQAP in the country. Now, that arrangement is in tatters. On Saturday, the coalition struck al Anad Airbase, which was used as the headquarters for U.S. counterterrorism operations, Houthi commanders said. Houthi rebels had taken control of the base. Houthi rebels and the government began doing battle in 2004, but arrived at a ceasefire in 2010, according to the CIA World Factbook. The country has seen much unrest in the wake of the Arab Spring uprising. Arab Spring wasn't supposed to turn out like this . Yemen was plunged into chaos when the Houthi rebels, who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country, began seizing control of the capital and other areas of the country last fall. Houthis moved into Sanaa in September, sparking battles that killed a few hundred people before a ceasefire was called. In January, they surrounded the presidential palace and Hadi resigned and was put under house arrest. In February the Houthis took control of military forces stationed near Sanaa, including the air force. But the chaos is not limited to the Houthi uprising. In the area of the southern port city of Aden, opposing Yemeni military forces -- those allied with the Houthis, and those supporting Hadi -- have fought for more than a week. CORRECTION: Pakistan is not participating in airstrikes over Yemen, the Pakistani embassy in Washington said. CNN previously included Pakistan in an illustration of coalition member countries participating the operation Determination Storm. The illustration said the country was contributing 15 jets. That illustration has since been updated. Journalist Hakim Almasmari reported from Sanaa; CNN's Ben Brumfield wrote this story from Atlanta. CNN's Jason Hanna and Ian Lee contributed to this report.","highlights":"Son of former president removed from post as ambassador to United Arab Emirates .\nReuters video shows trucks carrying tanks in Saudi Arabia near Yemen border .\nYemen's foreign minister says he expects coalition troops to arrive within days ."}
{"article":"Joe Schmidt has made just one change to his starting line-up for Wales on Saturday, fit-again Jamie Heaslip returning in place of Jordi Murphy. Injured on February 14 against France, Heaslip has timed his recovery from the three vertebrae fractured by Pascal Pap\u00e9 perfectly. It was anticipated that the problem, treated like a soft tissue injury, could come right in four weeks and the medics have been proved spot on, Heaslip taking part in full training all week to put himself in the frame to resume against Wales. Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt (above) has made one change to the side that beat England . Jamie Heaslip (centre) is back after being injured by Pascal Pape against France on February 14 . Jonathan Sexton (left) has recovered from the hamstring problem that he had for Ireland . R Kearney (Leinster), T Bowe, J Payne (both Ulster), R Henshaw (Connacht), S Zebo (Munster), J Sexton (Racing Metro), C Murray (Munster), J McGrath (Leinster), R Best (Ulster), M Ross, D Toner (both Leinster), P O'Connell (capt), P O'Mahony (both Munster), S O'Brien, J Heaslip (both Leinster). Replacements: S Cronin, C Healy, M Moore (all Leinster), I Henderson (Ulster), J Murphy, E Reddan, I Madigan (all Leinster), F Jones (Munster). Murphy will consider himself unlucky not to have held on, given his impressive show in helping subdue the vaunted English back row, but Heaslip has been true to his word after saying last Friday that he was \u2018pretty confident\u2019 he would be declared fit for the Millennium Stadium. Murphy instead takes a place on the bench at the expense of Tommy O\u2019Donnell who demonstrated his worth for the second time this spring, coming on as an early replacement against England for the concussed Se\u00e1n O\u2019Brien and again not looking out of his depth. Elsewhere, with Jonathan Sexton shaking off his hamstring problem, and O\u2019Brien and Jared Payne both coming through concussion protocols, Schmidt\u2019s team is as expected as they seek to set up a Grand Slam trip to Murrayfield on Saturday week. Jordi Murphy is expected to make way for the return of Heaslip against Wales on Saturday . Jack McGrath is set to keep his place in the Ireland team for the Six Nations game against Wales . It means Schmidt has continued to reward Jack McGrath for his consistently good form, keeping Cian Healy, who started his first game for Leinster in six months last Saturday, on the bench for the third Test in a row. There was concern about replacement out-half Ian Madigan\u2019s control of the closing 25 minutes against England, but he is again back-up to Sexton. Felix Jones has been given the No 23 shirt once more, despite pressure from in-form Munster colleague Keith Earls.","highlights":"Ireland lead Six Nations standings after beating England in the last game .\nJamie Heaslip makes a return from injury for the Wales clash .\nHis comeback is sees Jordi Murphy drop to the bench in Cardiff ."}
{"article":"Arsene Wenger has revealed that he was spat at whilst playing football in France - but that in those days he extracted his own revenge on the pitch. The Arsenal manager says that United defender Jonny Evans - who will be banned for the FA Cup quarter final against Arsenal on Monday - cannot expect any mercy in the modern age of global TV scrutiny. However, Wenger says the practice was more prevalent in former days when he played for RC Strasbourg in France, but that the lack of TV coverage meant it used to be less of an issue. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger reveals he was spat at while playing football in the French leagues . Jonny Evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the Newcastle United striker, who then retaliates . Wenger said: 'Today the television makes it worse. I've been subject personally to spitting. Maybe my tackle was not good enough. At the time nobody spoke about it. 'When I played in France, it happened before but you didn't see it on television. When you see it on television it of course makes it worse. I was angry (when it happened) but I could control myself.' Asked whether spitting deserved a six-game ban, Wenger said: 'I applied the sentence myself. I don't know the rules well enough. It is rules. We have to respect the rules. They have to apply the rules. Evans and Papiss Cisse clash near the half-way line at St James' Park following the unpleasant exchange . Manchester United defender Evans has received a six-match ban from the FA after the ugly incident . Cisse already served a three-match ban for violent conduct this season after elbowing Everton\u2019s Seamus Coleman in December. As a result, the Newcastle striker gets an additional one-match suspension after admitting his guilt, while Evans gets six. But Wenger insisted that the likes of Evans and Papiss Cisse have to accept that their actions will incur punishments now that all games are scrutinised by millions of viewers worldwide. 'We have to pay a price for that. We are popular. We are watched all over the world. It gives us some responsibility as well. When you do not live up to it, you have to pay for it. How much it (the punishment) is, I do not care but you cannot say: 'Ok, it's nothing' when you see in on television. When little boys are watching the game, if your boy says to you: 'Is that right?' You cannot say: 'Yes.' 'We have to accept that. There are cameras everywhere, that means we are spied on always basically, from morning until night, and that's a little bit less freedom to go over the line sometimes. 'It's good, it's good. You know it's like now the doping story that is coming out in cycling now. Even if it's 10 years later, 15 years later, people will be less inclined to do it today because they think: 'Oh, for the rest of my life that could come out, so I won't do it.' Cisse has been banned for seven games after accepting the charge from the FA on Thursday .","highlights":"Arsenal manager reveals he was spat at while playing football in France .\nBut the Frenchman insists he got his revenge on the football pitch .\nCisse and Jonny Evans were this week caught up in a spitting row .\nBoth  received  bans for spitting during Newcastle v Manchester United ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Slain Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov isn't the first critic of President Vladimir Putin to turn up dead. Some Putin opponents claim it isn't a coincidence that critics of the powerful leader and his government have been killed or landed behind bars. But the Kremlin has staunchly denied accusations that it's targeting political opponents or had anything to do with the deaths. Here's a look at some cases of outspoken critics of Putin's government who've ended up in exile, under house arrest, behind bars or dead. The business magnate backed an opposition party and accused Putin of corruption. He spent more than 10 years behind bars on charges of tax evasion and fraud. In statements to CNN, Khodorkovsky said his prosecution was part of a Kremlin campaign to destroy him and take control of Yukos, the oil company he built from privatization deals in the 1990s. The Kremlin denied the accusation. At the time of Khodorkovsky's sentencing, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that \"allegations about some kind of selective prosecution in Russia are groundless. Russian courts deal with thousands of cases where entrepreneurs are prosecuted.\" Due for release in August 2014, he was released nearly a year earlier, in December 2013, after Putin signed an amnesty decree pardoning him. His release, along with the pardoning of dissident Russian punk band Pussy Riot and a group of Greenpeace protesters, was widely seen as an attempt to improve the country's image before the Winter Olympics in Sochi last February. Khodorkovsky is now living in Switzerland. He told CNN's Christiane Amanpour last month that he wants to see regime change in his country. \"I think that my country doesn't deserve a new era of authoritarianism,\" he said. \"But at the same time, I don't want a revolution.\" She was a vocal critic of Russia's war in Chechnya. Her home was a safe place, until it became the scene of her murder. She was shot four times at the entrance of her Moscow apartment in October 2006. Last year, a Moscow court sentenced five men to prison for the killing. Authorities alleged that an unidentified man asked Lom-Ali Gaitukayev, whom the jury found was a mastermind of the slaying, to kill Politkovskaya in exchange for $150,000 because of her reports of human rights violations and other issues, the Moscow city court said. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists said her work chronicling human rights abuses in Chechnya led to threats against her and angered Russian authorities. Shortly after her death, Putin denied any Kremlin involvement in her killing, saying that Politkovskaya's \"death in itself is more damaging to the current authorities both in Russia and the Chechen Republic ... than her activities.\" The former Russian agent was poisoned by a lethal dose of radioactive polonium, his tea spiked in a London hotel during a meeting with two former Russian security servicemen. After leaving the Russian Federal Security Service, he blamed the agency for orchestrating a series of apartment bombings in Russia in 1999 that left hundreds dead and led to Russia's invasion of Chechnya later that year. In a statement from his deathbed in London in November 2006, he said he had no doubt about who was to blame for his imminent death. \"You may succeed in silencing me, but that silence comes at a price,\" Litvinenko said at the time. \"You may succeed in silencing one man, but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate, Mr. Putin, in your ears for the rest of your life.\" Officials have always dismissed the accusation as \"nonsense,\" but suspicions linger. A Russian federal intelligence service spokesman went as far as to say that Moscow had not carried out any \"physical liquidation of unwelcome personalities\" since the Soviet era. The two prime suspects in the poisoning, Andrei Lugavoi and Dmitry Kovtun, are Russian nationals. Both are former agents of the Russian security services. But both deny involvement, and the Russian government refuses to extradite either to Britain to face trial. In January 2009, a masked man shot and killed Markelov, a Russian human rights lawyer known for his work on abuses by the Russian military in Chechnya. The gunman also shot Baburova, a journalist from Russia's Novaya Gazeta newspaper, when she tried to intervene. Markelov was known for his work on high-profile cases. He represented the family of a Chechen woman killed by a former Russian colonel in March 2000. He held a news conference hours before his death opposing the early release of Col. Yury Budanov, who had been convicted of strangling a Chechen teenage girl and was freed after serving eight years of a 10-year sentence. At the time, Novaya Gazeta Editor-in-Chief Dmitry Muratov suggested that Baburova was killed when she tried to stop the lawyer's killer, but he said he couldn't dismiss the possibility that she was also a target. Russian authorities said members of a neo-Nazi group were behind the killings, and two neo-Nazis were convicted for the deaths. The Chechnya-based human rights activist was kidnapped outside her home there in July 2009 and found dead in the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia later the same day. Her body was riddled with bullets, Russian prosecutors said -- several shots to the abdomen, and one to the head. Estemirova had spent years investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya. She told CNN in 2007 that she was investigating dozens of abductions and murders that had become the norm in Chechnya, where security forces were fighting a dirty war against separatist rebels. The head of the group Estemirova worked for, Memorial, accuses the Kremlin-backed Chechen leadership of ordering her killing. Her death drew the ire of European leaders. \"How many more Natalya Estemirovas and Anna Politkovskayas must be killed before the Russian authorities protect people who stand up for the human rights of Russian citizens?\" Terry Davis, then the Council of Europe secretary general, said at the time. The Guardian reported shortly after Estemirova's death that Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov and his aides had threatened her. Kadyrov denied involvement in her killing, calling it a \"monstrous crime\" that was carried out to discredit his government. The powerful Russian businessman's falling-out with his government left him self-exiled in England. Berezovsky accused the Kremlin of killing Litvinenko. And for years, he bankrolled the effort of Litvinenko's widow to push for an inquest into her husband's death. In 2013, he was found dead inside his house with a noose around his neck. Was it a suicide? The coroner's office said it could not say. In 2013, during a phone call to a television show, Putin said he could not rule out that foreign secret services had a role in Berezovsky's death. However, he added that there is no evidence of this. A corruption-fighting lawyer, Navalny famously branded Putin's United Russia party \"the party of crooks and thieves.\" He has been a prominent organizer of mass street protests and has attacked corruption in Russian government, using his blog and social media. The Kremlin critic was arrested in December just after hours after he was found guilty of fraud in a politically charged trial . Navalny was detained after he broke house arrest and went to join a protest against the court's verdict. In court, he got a three-and-a-half-year suspended sentence for the fraud conviction, while his brother, Oleg, also convicted of fraud, was given a prison term of the same length. The brothers denied charges of embezzling 30 million rubles ($540,000) from a Russian subsidiary of French cosmetics company Yves Rocher between 2008 and 2012. Before the December ruling, he was under house arrest after he was convicted in 2013 of misappropriating $500,000 worth of state-owned timber, in what he told CNN was a fabricated case. The Telegraph reported that the Kremlin denies fabricating the case. A spokesman for Putin said the President only learned of the sentence from the media. Nemtsov, 55, was a top official with the Republican Party of Russia\/Party of People's Freedom, a liberal opposition group. He had been arrested several times for speaking against Putin's government. The most recent arrests were in 2011, when he protested the results of parliamentary elections, and in 2012, when tens of thousands protested against Putin. Most recently, he had been critical of the Kremlin's handling of the Ukraine crisis. After his death Friday night, opposition leader Ilya Yashin said his friend had been working on a report about Russian troops and their involvement in Ukraine. In an interview with Newsweek magazine just hours before his death, Nemtsov said Russia was \"drowning\" under Putin's leadership and was swiftly becoming a fascist state. \"Due to the policy of Vladimir Putin, a country with unparalleled potential is sinking, an economy which accumulated untold currency reserves is collapsing,\" he said. The former deputy prime minister accused Putin of using \"Goebbels-style propaganda\" -- a reference to Joseph Goebbels, Nazi Germany's propaganda minister -- to brainwash his countrymen. Nemtsov was scheduled to lead an opposition rally in Moscow last Sunday. But two days before the event, he was shot dead as he walked home from dinner with his Ukrainian model girlfriend. The killing took place just meters away from the Kremlin. The Kremlin suggested Nemtsov may have been killed by enemies of Russia intent on creating political discord. But many Nemtsov supporters suspect Putin's administration of involvement. CNN's Matthew Chance, Ivan Watson, Alla Eshchenko, Laura Smith-Spark, Holly Yan and Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.","highlights":"Some claim it's no coincidence that critics of Putin and his government have been killed or imprisoned .\nBut the Kremlin staunchly denies accusations that it's targeting political opponents ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Early Thursday -- during the ongoing protests that continue to shake Ferguson, Missouri -- two police officers were shot. Such violence and lawlessness should never be tolerated. But the unrest during which it occurred demonstrates that the people of Ferguson have lost all confidence in their police department. And the resignation of the police chief this week won't be enough to restore faith in law and order. Everyone in the department needs to step down so the department can be rebuilt from the ground up. It is easy to see why. After a police officer shot Michael Brown, the U.S. Department of Justice conducted an investigation into the Ferguson Police Department. What investigators found was a \"pattern and practice\" of discrimination against African-Americans. In a town with a black population of 67%, black people represented 85% of vehicle searches, 90% of the traffic violations and 93% of the arrests. There is no way to justify this. Now, the Department of Justice has an opportunity to gut the Ferguson Police Department and rebuild it from scratch. In fact, it's more than an opportunity: It's a necessity. In the court of law, there is an old closing argument that goes like this: You sit down, pour yourself a bowl of stew and find that the first piece of meat that you taste is rancid. You don't put just that piece aside; you throw out the whole bowl. Lawyers use this story to say that if you catch a witness lying about one thing, then you can't believe anything they say. Unfortunately, it is an analogy that can be applied to the Ferguson Police Department. The Department of Justice report revealing unquestionable racist bias that permeated the entire department cannot be ignored, and the problems it reveals cannot be fixed from the inside. If there are a few good cops in the Ferguson Police Department, they need to leave, and they need to go elsewhere to continue their proud law enforcement career without being overshadowed by their involvement in a poisoned organization. In fact, everyone in the Ferguson Police Department needs to leave, from the top to the bottom. The police department should be completely reconstituted under Department of Justice control in a manner that ensures that citizens of Ferguson receive the type of public service they pay for and deserve -- and more importantly, in a manner that protects their rights, not only as citizens of Ferguson, Missouri, but as constitutionally protected citizens of our country. A completely rebuilt Ferguson Police Department, established with a charter to enforce the law with equality, could serve as an example for every law enforcement agency in the country. A new Ferguson Police Department could show what a concerted, roots-up effort toward nonracist behavior in a police department can be. Under Justice Department leadership, the Ferguson Police Department could become a model for practices such as equipping all police with body cameras, community policing and better use of force training. If we can create from the ashes of the Ferguson Police Department a model that works, it may provide some consolation for minorities who have been disproportionately targeted by law enforcement. And if the black community in Ferguson -- in fact, people of every race in Ferguson -- can look back five years from now and see an unbiased organization of public servants who give respect and get respect, who reduce fear rather than cause it, then perhaps the tragedy of Michael Brown's death will stand for something.","highlights":"Mark O'Mara: Justice Department says Ferguson has record of racial discrimination .\nO'Mara says police force in Ferguson must be dismantled .\nHe says a new department, with new practices to prevent replay of abuses, can be model for others, help repair injustices in Ferguson ."}
{"article":"(CNN)The State Department only last month started automatically preserving dozens of high-level officials' emails, according to a department spokeswoman, a revelation that comes amid the controversy surrounding former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's own email use. This is key because Clinton, in her news conference on Tuesday to answer questions about why she exclusively used a private email address to communicate during her tenure, told reporters she'd thought her communications to senior department officials were always saved. That's an important point, given legal requirements for preserving federal records. \"In meeting the record-keeping obligations, it was my practice to email government officials on their State or dot-gov accounts so that the emails were immediately captured and preserved,\" she said. The news about the State Department's archiving practices -- and the change that started in February -- could refuel the furor of Republicans over Clinton's choice to not use her government email account, to have a private server in her family home house her emails, and to decide (with her staff) which emails to delete and which to turn over to the State Department for review. Rep. Susan Brooks, a member of the select committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attack, said in the Republicans' weekly media address Saturday, \"You see, right now there is no way for us to know whether we have all of the State Department communications that rightfully belong to the American people.\" \"The only way to truly know is by having access to Secretary Clinton's personal server,\" the Indiana Republican added. \"We are asking Secretary Clinton to turn her server over to a neutral, third-party arbiter. After a complete inventory, this arbiter can make a determination as to which emails should be public and which should remain private. These decisions would be completely impartial and independent.\" So far, Brooks' committee had gotten just under 300 of Clinton's emails from the State Department. Last year, as it was trying to update its records, the State Department asked former secretaries of state for nonpersonal emails from their personal accounts that could be work-related. That request prompted Clinton to turn over 30,490 emails -- about 55,000 pages. Clinton has asked for those emails to be made public, and department officials are reviewing them to make sure no sensitive information is released. Clinton's office had said her account contained 62,320 sent and received emails from March 2009 to February 2013. \"About half were personal that were not in any way related to work. I had no reason to save them,\" Clinton said at her press conference. The fact that all emails from senior officials weren't automatically saved until recently doesn't mean they are gone, according to the State Department. \"I wouldn't state it's lost to history, because there are always -- there are technical means of gaining access to past information,\" spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Friday. At the same time, Psaki said the State Department chose to change its approach -- by automatically saving all emails -- \"because it's an imperfect system.\" \"This is a more efficient and better way,\" she said of the new system. \"But, obviously, there were ways to preserve (emails), and employees and individuals were expected to do that prior to this new process.\" Separately, Psaki said that a letter was recently sent to former State Department staffers asking for their help in the preservation effort. \"If they should become aware ... of federal record in their possession -- such as an email sent or received on a personal email account while (they were) serving in their official capacity at the Department -- that ... record (should) be made available to the Department,\" Psaki said the ex-staffers were told. Even before last month's chance, emails of current Secretary of State John Kerry, who uses a government address, were already being saved automatically. CNN's Adam Levine contributed to this report.","highlights":"Hillary Clinton used a private email address while Secretary of State .\nShe's said she thought her communications to officials were always saved .\nHowever, a State Department official says emails weren't automatically archived until last month ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Christopher Nowak says none of his friends were surprised when he and his wife decided to use a down payment for a home on a monorail car instead. After all, this was no ordinary monorail car, and Nowak is not your average collector. This was the front cab of an original monorail train that transported millions of visitors throughout Walt Disney World in the 1970s and 1980s. The original Mark IV monorail trains were retired in 1989 to make room for a new generation of models, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Nowak and his wife are Disney fanatics who honeymooned at Disney World and once visited all the Disney parks in the world (minus Paris) in a month. He's also a self-described artist, inventor and collector of \"weird old vehicles,\" including an articulated bus he claims to have transformed into a mobile nightclub. The couple from Chico, California, purchased the cab in 2014, dreaming of the day they might use it to drive their kids to school or bring it to the annual Burning Man festival (Nowak declined to say what he paid for the rail car.) But plans change. Nowak listed the item last week on eBay for $260,000 with a starting bid of $169,000. More than 1,500 people were watching the auction as of Saturday night, though no one had bid. The listing itself was pulled from eBay on Sunday. Nowak, who owns a sound and lighting custom stage design company, had told CNN he and his wife needed the money to fund their next big project, but he declined to provide details. \"My wife and I had plans for it, but we're kind of strapped for cash, so we figured, let's put it out and see what happens.\" The listing provided some insight into what Nowak might have had in mind for the cab. \"Some people have train cars in their back yard, imagine your own monorail guest room, or man cave. Mount it on a bus chassis and drive it around!! Turn it into your kids' ultimate clubhouse,\" the description on the eBay page read. \"This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to own a very serious piece of Disney history.\" The listing said the vehicle is available for viewing in Tampa, where Nowak left it with a friend after buying it from a seller in Georgia via eBay last year. CNN could not independently confirm its authenticity. Nowak says he did not receive a title or certificate of authenticity when he purchased the cab but he is confident that it's the real deal. \"I guess there's chance it could be a reproduction, but I'm not too worried,\" he said. The listing promised free shipping, but Nowak is not sure that he's ready to part with the item. \"I'm sure I'd have salty taste in my mouth if it gets sold, but we'll see what happens,\" he said. \"If this thing gets sold, I know that in 20 years, I'll look back and think that of all the things I got rid of, this is the coolest.\"","highlights":"The listing has been removed from eBay .\nThe front cab of a Walt Disney World monorail train is on sale on eBay .\nThe seller is a Disney fan who's not sure whether he's ready to part with it ."}

{"article":"(CNN)A quick descent. No distress call. The pilot's actions. It will be months, or longer, before the causes behind Tuesday's crash of Germanwings Flight 4U 9525 are known, but there are initial clues that aviation experts say will be the most important to investigators. Speculation comes in the wake of any tragedy such as this, but experts say certain facts can be significant for those who want to know what happened. The most useful clues so far: . One of the plane's \"black boxes\" has been recovered, the French interior minister said. The data recorder will be the most useful in determining the cause of the crash. Its contents are still unknown, but it is a good sign that it was found just hours after the crash. France's aviation accident investigation bureau will examine the device immediately, the interior minister said. Real-time flight data available to the public tells a key part of the story. According to online flight trackers, the Germanwings plane had been flying at 38,000 feet when, about 30 minutes into the trip, it started descending. Six minutes later, it was recorded at 24,000 feet -- a drop of 14,000 feet. It continued to descend after that -- it's last recorded altitude was 11,400 feet. The rate of descent indicates that the pilot was still controlling the plane to some extent, CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo said. If the engines had stalled, the plane would have crashed in less time, she said. Departure: Barcelona, Spain, at 10:01 a.m. (26 minutes late) Destination: Scheduled to land in Dusseldorf, Germany, at 11:39 a.m. Passengers: 150 (144 passengers, six crew members) Airplane: Airbus A320 (twin-jet) Airline: Germanwings (budget airline owned by Lufthansa) Flight distance: 726 miles . Last known tracking data: 10:38 a.m. Last known speed: 480 mph . Last known altitude: 11,400 feet . Last known location: Near Digne-les-Bains, France, in the Alps . Sources: CNN and flightaware.com . The initial data about the plane's descent means that the pilot could have been trying to make an emergency landing, or that the plane was gliding with the pilot's guidance, Schiavo said. A scenario where the plane was gliding is potentially more dangerous because wide fields for landing would be hard to come by in the mountains, she said. Another aviation analyst, David Soucie, said the quickness of the descent shows something went wrong, but also that the plane was not out of control. The plane was descending \"faster than an elevator at that point. You're feeling it down. It's pulling you down, and you can sense that,\" Soucie said. A telling piece of data is that the plane maintained speed as it descended, he said. It could show that the pilot was aware that something was wrong and was controlling the speed as the plane went down. \"It was a controlled descent, and there was something that had gone wrong that he had no control over or he would have controlled it,\" Soucie said. The data on air traffic accidents are clear: A majority of accidents happen upon takeoff or landing. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, even though 83% of a plane's flight time is taken up with the climb, cruise and descent phases, less than 16% of accidents happen during this period. Soucie described the timing of the crash as an \"anomalous thing that happened.\" It is \"incredibly rare to happen in the middle of the flight,\" he said, meaning the pilot would have to act fast. Contrary to some early reports, the French Civil Aviation Authority told CNN that the crew of the Germanwings plane did not issue a distress call. It was air traffic controllers who sent out a distress call after radio contact with the plane was lost. The lack of an emergency call can raise a red flag to a nonpilot. Why would a pilot not alert someone that there is an emergency? Does it hint to an incursion in the cockpit or a pilot's motives? It might sound counterintuitive, but calling for help is not the first thing on a pilot's checklist when things go wrong. Soucie said the principle that a pilot follows during an emergency is this: Aviate, navigate and communicate. In other words, before turning on a distress call or transponder, the pilot's first concern is to fly the plane, and secondly, to find the safest option for a crash landing, if it comes to that. The Germanwings pilot \"was definitely aviating and navigating from what we can tell,\" Soucie said. The pilot was conceivably looking for a place to try to land, he said. A distress call -- had it happened -- could have signaled a different story. Schiavo explained that there are codes that pilots have -- certain words that if uttered by the pilot indicate to air traffic controllers that there is a hijacking. The initial reports are that there was no hijack code transmitted from the plane. A big part of determining the cause of the crash will be whether such a code was sent or not. \"I don't think you'd rule anything out at this point,\" CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said. \"It's not like it appears as if it was an in-flight breakup. So what was going on in the cockpit is what we're going to be talking about in the coming days.\" O'Brien pointed out the known details of the crash -- a rapid descent, no radio call and a flight that continues into the mountains -- are not part of a \"typical emergency scenario.\" There were no reported weather issues during the plane's flight, but that does not mean you can rule these out as a possible cause, pilot and CNN aviation analyst Les Abend said. One thing Abend was looking at was a cold front progressing in the area where the plane was. It indicated some precipitation at lower altitudes. So there may not have been bad weather at the cruising altitude, but \"at lower altitudes, as they were beginning the descent, their visibility may have been obscured,\" Abend said. Reduced visibility in and of itself is not a huge issue, but the weather may have deteriorated as the plane descended and be a possible factor in the crash, he said.","highlights":"CNN aviation analyst says this is not a typical emergency incident, but all possibilities are part of probe .\nThe cause behind the crash of the Germanwings plane is unknown .\nThere are early clues, however, that will be key to investigators ."}

{"article":"(CNN)They were not-so-affectionately dubbed the \"bed-wetters\" by then-Obama senior adviser David Plouffe. The definition: Democrats who run to the hills every time there's a bump in the road. The Chicken Littles. The woe-is-us crowd. Well, they're at it again. Not surprisingly, it's because of the Hillary Clinton email brouhaha, an unforced error that is now ricocheting around the political world. And the home team stands in place, just watching, somewhat stunned. But Democrats don't actually have the luxury of standing by and seeing how this all plays out. Hillary Clinton is their candidate; their putative nominee. \"Their only viable plan is to make her the best candidate possible,\" says one senior Democratic strategist. \"And from time to time, this may require an intervention.\" Now might be a good time. But while the anxious Democrats shake their heads about the state of affairs \u2014 and the lack of serious alternatives in the presidential lineup \u2014 they might do well to look at themselves. Over the past six years, there's been a sharp structural decline of elected Democrats everywhere below the presidential level. Sure, we all know about how the Republicans regained control of the Senate in 2014, but what about the fact that blue-state governors fell like tent poles? Or that GOP governors now outnumber the Democrats by almost two-to-one, 31 to 18. Or that Republicans have complete control of nearly three times as many state legislatures as the Democrats, 30 to 11. And down the ballot, Democrats under Obama have lost more than 900 state legislative seats: the worst showing of any modern president. That's eye-popping. So, the conventional judgment that the Clinton behemoth is just too big \u2014 too well funded, too well supported, too historic \u2014 all helps account for the paucity of alternatives, to be sure. But there's much, much more to it than the phenom of Bigfoot Hillary. It's the phenom of Barack Obama, too \u2014 and the very strong counterforces he's generated around the country. The gains at the presidential level have not been cost-free: The country is polarized, the Democrats are often on defense and they're losing ground. One result: a thin presidential bench, which is painfully evident. Clinton asks State to release emails: What you need to know . And if you take a peek at those blue-state governors who might be president, consider this: At 76, Jerry Brown, an able leader, is probably past his sell-by date for a presidential bid. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has made very few moves to raise his national profile. And Democratic governors are very thin on the ground in the heartland. Any time you have Republicans winning the gubernatorial races in Massachusetts, Illinois and Maryland, Democrats should pay attention. As has been the case with other presidents, for Obama party-building has not been on top of the agenda. But it shows. And so when Hillary Clinton runs into some trouble, the Democrats ought to worry. The Republicans have a deep and varied field; the Democrats have one real horse in the race no matter how much she stumbles out of the gate. Speaking of Hillary Clinton, part of the problem right now is situational. Those Democrats who want to defend her say there's a problem -- they're not quite sure what they're defending, because they're not sure exactly what happened, or why. In other words, the wagons are circled, but the surrogates are left outside. Next, while Team Clinton may have considered the upside of waiting to announce her candidacy (Why not let the GOP battle it out? No need to give the GOP early target practice?), the downside is now obvious: How do you mount a defense with no real or organized apparatus to respond? If you're out there making personal appearances, it looks odd to ignore the elephant in the room. No matter how much you tweet about it. Clinton's stumbles fuel Democratic critics . Bottom line, there is no organized pushback and there is no Plan B. (OK, Jim Webb, Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders, we know who you are, and that you're probably running, but still.) Or at least no Big Plan B. The pre-presidential league on the Democratic side is not exactly overflowing with big-time candidates. (Unless you think Vice President Joe Biden is running or Secretary of State John Kerry is running, which they likely are not. Same for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.) So \"bed-wetters,\" beware. The truth is simple: Your job is to defend Hillary Clinton, not to bury her. Yes, it can be hard. Even annoying. But think about it this way: If you don't, her problems become your own.","highlights":"Gloria Borger: Democratic Party has no real alternative for 2016 and its bench is painfully thin .\nShe says it may not be fun, but Democrats have no choice but to defend Clinton on issues like the email question ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Latest developments: . \u2022 Transponder data shows that the autopilot on Germanwings Flight 9525 was reprogrammed by someone in the cockpit to change the plane's altitude from 38,000 feet to 100 feet, according to Flightradar24, a website that tracks aviation data. \u2022 Police searched Germanwings Flight 9525 co-pilot Andreas Lubitz's apartment in Dusseldorf, Germany, on Thursday, the city's police spokesman said in televised comments. A team of five investigators went \"through the apartment looking for clues as to what the co-pilot's motivation might have been, if he did indeed bring the plane down,\" police spokesman Markus Niesczery said. Full story: . The co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525 purposely crashed the plane into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board, officials said Thursday. \"We at Lufthansa are speechless that this aircraft has been deliberately crashed by the co-pilot,\" said Carsten Spohr, CEO of Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings. Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said the co-pilot, 27-year-old German national Andreas Lubitz, apparently \"wanted to destroy the aircraft.\" It's unknown whether Lubitz planned his actions, Robin said. But he \"took advantage\" of a moment in which the pilot left the cockpit and \"activated the descent,\" which can only be done deliberately. New details released Thursday appeared to support the startling revelation that someone set the plane on a crash course. Transponder data shows that the autopilot was reprogrammed during the flight by someone inside the cockpit to change the plane's altitude from 38,000 feet to 100 feet, according to Flightradar24, a website that tracks aviation data. The plane's cockpit audio recorder captured horrific sounds. The captain, somehow locked out of the cockpit, can be heard banging on the door, Robin said. And screaming can be heard on the audio recording for the final few minutes of the flight. For those on board when the plane plunged into the mountains, Robin said, death was instantaneous. Who was co-pilot Andreas Lubitz? Police searched Lubitz's apartment in Dusseldorf on Thursday, looking for clues about his possible motive. A search is underway for the plane's second \"black box,\" the flight data recorder, which could shed more light on the plane's final minutes. And the French government has asked the FBI to help investigate the crash, a law enforcement official said. Investigators so far say they're baffled about why Lubitz would have crashed the plane . Lufthansa does \"not have any clues,\" Spohr said. The picture of the plane's final minutes comes largely from what was discovered in the mangled cockpit voice recorder. The pilot and co-pilot had normal exchanges during the beginning of the flight, Robin said. When the pilot stepped out to go to the bathroom, he asked Lubitz to take over. It's unclear whether the pilot entered a code to try to get back into the cockpit when he returned, or whether Lubitz \"put the lever on lock,\" which would have prevented the code from working, Spohr said. The most plausible explanation of what happened next is that Lubitz, \"through deliberate abstention, refused to open the cabin door ... to the chief pilot, and used the button\" to cause the plane to lose altitude, Robin said. The disaster is not being described as a \"terrorist attack,\" and the killing of 150 people would generally not be described as a \"suicide\" either, Robin said. Spohr agreed: \"If a person kills himself and also 149 other people, another word should be used -- not suicide,\" he said. Lubitz was not known to be on any terrorism list, and his religion was not immediately known, Robin said. 5 cases of pilots intentionally crashing . He had been with Germanwings since September 2013 and had completed 630 hours of flight time, the company said. Lubitz had trained at the Lufthansa flight center in Bremen, Germany. He only had about 100 hours of experience on the type of aircraft he was flying, but he had all the necessary certifications and qualifications to pilot the aircraft alone, the prosecutor said. He had passed medical tests, Spohr said. The audio recording showed his breathing to be steady, with no sign that he had a heart attack or other medical issue. Lufthansa does not have standard psychological testing for pilots once they are hired, Spohr said.  The company considers an applicant's psychological state when hiring, he said. The co-pilot was \"fully qualified to pilot the aircraft on his own,\" Robin said. A man in Montabaur, Germany, who belonged to the same flight club as Lubitz, said he couldn't believe it. \"The way I know Andreas, this is inconceivable,\" Peter Ruecker said. An 8-minute descent to death . Relatives and friends of the victims traveled on special Lufthansa flights to an area near the site where their loved ones perished. Seyne-les-Alpes, a nearby town, is serving as a staging post. Mayor Francis Hermitte predicted that 200 to 300 people would come to the area Thursday. Most are not expected to stay overnight, he said. But in case they do, he said, local residents have offered accommodations for them. Lufthansa is providing \"financial support\" to relatives of the victims, Spohr said. He declined to go into details. The families of the two pilots are also in France, Robin said, but they are not in the same place as the passengers' relatives. The bodies of the crash victims will not be released to family members until all DNA identification work has been done -- a process likely to last several weeks, he said. While some human remains have been recovered, many have not. The task is treacherous for search crews working on steep slopes in icy weather. Workers were dropped by helicopters and tied together for safety. Mother, daughter among 3 American victims . The doomed flight was traveling from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, Germany, when it crashed Tuesday. Germanwings said the plane reached its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet, and then dropped for about eight minutes. The plane lost contact with French radar at a height of about 6,000 feet.

{"article":"(CNN)The family of an unarmed biracial 19-year-old killed by police in Madison, Wisconsin, is pushing for peaceful protests online and in the streets. \"Our hands are stained with the blood of my nephew, and we are all left to deal with the aftermath,\" Turin Carter, the teen's uncle, told reporters on Monday. Carter stressed that his family wasn't anti-police, but said Tony Robinson's death \"highlights a universal problem with law enforcement and how its procedures have been carried out ... specifically as it pertains to the systematic targeting of young black males.\" But he said the problem goes beyond the chants of \"black lives matter\" that have already been used at protests over the case. \"I encourage everybody to show support regardless of race because this is truly a universal issue. ... We don't want to stop at just 'black lives matter,' because all lives matter,\" he said. The deadly confrontation has made Madison the latest epicenter of protests. Here's what we know about the Friday night shooting. The incident started when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars, Madison Police Chief Mike Koval said. Dispatchers identified him as Tony Robinson, according to 911 audio obtained by WKOW. A little later, the dispatcher says, \"Apparently Tony hit one of his friends. No weapons seen.\" About four minutes later, the dispatcher says, \"I got another call for the same suspect at [the same address]. He tried to strangle another patron.\" About 30 seconds later, an unidentified officer says, \"Shots fired, shots fired.\" When Officer Matt Kenny went to the apartment, he heard some commotion and forced his way in, Koval said. \"Once inside the home the subject involved in this incident -- the same one allegedly out in traffic and that had battered someone -- assaulted my officer,\" Koval said. After that, according to the chief, \"The officer did draw his revolver and subsequently shot the subject.\" Koval said it's understandable why protesters are outraged. \"He was unarmed. That's going to make this all the more complicated for the investigators, the public, to accept, to understand ... why deadly force had to be used,\" he said. A neighbor in the duplex said she heard it all happen. Two brothers shared the other apartment in the duplex, and Robinson was their friend, Kathy Bufton said. \"I heard rustling and things being knocked over and my kitchen ceiling actually kind of shook. ... I figured something was going on,\" she said. \"I heard somebody go down the stairs. And then I heard the shots.\" There were 4-6 shots fired, Bufton said. For the family, that's a horrifying reality. \"It takes one bullet from a trained gunman to end a life. It takes one bullet,\" Carter said Monday. \"And we know how many were fired.\" This isn't the first time Kenny used lethal force. In 2007, he shot and killed a man in what the police chief described as a \"suicide by cop.\" Kenny was exonerated of wrongdoing and received a commendation. During the confrontation Friday night, Kenny suffered a blow to the head, Koval said. He has been placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. \"It's a stressful period for him and his family, but he also understands that a family here has suffered a tragic loss and he understands that there has to be an investigation,\" said James Palmer, executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association. Under Wisconsin law, officer-involved shootings are investigated by an outside agency, in this case the Division of Criminal Investigation. Once the division completes its investigation, the report will go to the local district attorney, Koval said. Palmer declined to comment on the ongoing investigation, but said there are some circumstances when an unarmed person could still be seen as posing a deadly threat to a police officer. \"The real fear for any officer when he's being attacked, generally speaking, is that their weapon will be taken away,\" Palmer said, \"and an unarmed individual can become armed very quickly.\" Wisconsin Circuit Court documents indicate Robinson pleaded guilty in December to an armed robbery that occurred last April. His mother, Andrea Irwin, painted a different picture of the teen: \"My son has never been a violent person, never,\" she told CNN affiliate WKOW. \"To die in such a violent way baffles me.\" The police chief refused to comment on Robinson's criminal history or run-ins with police. \"I could but I choose not to,\" he said at a press conference Saturday. \"I frankly think it is, for our purposes today, wholly inappropriate and I am not going to blemish anyone's character, particularly someone's as young as his.\" On Monday, Robinson's uncle told reporters his nephew wasn't a saint and had made some poor decisions, but was still a \"good, kindhearted kid.\" \"We paint him as a human being, a 19-year-old who made a terrible mistake at one point, which is completely dissociated from this act,\" he said. Madison Mayor Paul Soglin, who said he met with Robinson's family the night of the shooting, said officials aren't going to put the teen on trial. \"That's not what this is about. What this is about is finding out exactly what happened that night and to determine, then, responsibility,\" he told CNN's \"AC360.\" \"We know that he was not armed, and as far as the police chief and I are concerned ... the fact that Tony was involved in any kind of transgression in the past has nothing to do with this present tragedy.\" Because Robinson did not have a weapon, the death spurred memories of other unarmed black men killed by police: Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York. Over the weekend, protesters filled streets in Madison. On Monday, demonstrators packed the Wisconsin State Capitol. They chanted and carried a banner with a familiar message: \"Black lives matter.\" Asked the difference between Ferguson and Madison, Carter said Monday the cases are \"similar, but different,\" noting that his nephew's \"racial ambiguity\" was an important part of his identity. \"Tony's racial ambiguity reinforces the fact that America's racial lines are completely, 100% blurred,\" he said. \"My sister is a white mother of black children who had black and white relatives. We are all multiple races and we each have our own complex heritage.\" Among the protesters are members of the Young, Gifted and Black Coalition that was formed last summer after the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson. The group wants more reactive policing in African-American neighborhoods, said group member Brandi Grayson. She said Madison police park on street corners in African-American neighborhoods and wait for something to happen, which leads to residents being hassled. That doesn't happen in white neighborhoods, she said. \"In light of so many things that have happened not just across the country, but in our own community, it's understandable that the reaction at the scene and of some of our citizens is extremely volatile, emotional and upsetting,\" Chief Koval told CNN affiliate WKOW-TV. \"And we understand that. That's absolutely appropriate under these circumstances. We would urge, obviously, that everyone exercise restraint.\" Koval said he knows it may be difficult for Madison to move forward after Robinson's death. He visited the teen's grandmother over the weekend but was advised by them to not visit the mother yet because the emotions are still too raw. \"We need to start, as any healing or any reconciliation should, with an 'Im sorry,' and I've done that privately, and I'm attempting to do that publicly and that's the only way we can sort of begin the healing or the rift that may take years, if at all, to mend,\" the police chief said. \"But the effort has to be there. So we have to acknowledge it, we have to own it, we have to say we are sorry at the outset for it and then we have to show affirmative steps in moving forward to bring the community back into the fold, as it were.\" CNN's Rosa Flores, Gary Tuchman, Brianna Keilar, Ralph Ellis, Joe Sutton and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","highlights":"Uncle: The shooting highlights \"systematic targeting of young black males\"\nTony Robinson, 19, was unarmed when an officer killed him .\nThe officer who shot him suffered a blow to the head ."}

In her first public appearance since revealing that she underwent a second preventive surgery to lower her risk of cancer, Jolie attended the show with her children, Shiloh and Zahara. She hugged them before she went to the stage to accept the favorite villain award for her role as Maleficent in the live-action reimagining of \"Sleeping Beauty.\" \"When I was little, like Maleficent, I was told that I was different.  And I felt out of place -- too loud, too full of fire, never good at sitting still, never good at fitting in,\" the 39-year-old actor and humanitarian said. \"And, then one day I realized something, something that I hope you all realize: Different is good,\" she said, prompting enthusiastic screams from the young crowd. \"And, as your villain, I would also say cause a little trouble -- it's good for you.\" Jolie's career has been full of unconventional twists and turns, from her breakthrough role in the biopic \"Gia\" to her current role as an actor, filmmaker and special envoy of the U.N.'s High Commissioner for Refugees. Her personal life also has made front page headlines over the years, including her adoption of children from developing countries and her candor in discussing her health. Jolie, 39, wrote Tuesday in a New York Times essay that she had opted for the surgery after blood tests revealed markers that might have been an indication of early cancer. Two years ago, she underwent a double mastectomy for similar reasons. Jolie's mother died of ovarian cancer, and the actress has a gene mutation that makes her chances of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer much higher than the overall population. Jolie's revelation provoked an outpouring of support as the news spread across social media. \"It is not easy to make these decisions.

{"article":"After a career working with some of European football\u2019s top clubs, Jose Mourinho has experienced the highs and lows of management. On Friday, as he raised his right arm high into the air to emphasise his point, Mourinho wanted it made clear to Graeme Souness and\u00a0Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher that he remains at the top of his game. It was a low blow, calling the Sky Sports analysts out because they dared to criticise Chelsea\u2019s players for surrounding Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers during the Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain. Jose Mourinho opened up about the criticism aimed at his Chelsea by  Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness . Mourinho was in a spiky mood during a lively press conference on Friday and was full of gestures . Mourinho came up with another famous quip:\u00a0\u2018Envy is the biggest tribute that the shadows do to the man' Mourinho claimed they were envious of his success as a coach, claiming the former Liverpool players have short memories after their careers at the top of the sport. The Chelsea manager said: \u2018Envy is the biggest tribute that the shadows do to the man. It\u2019s about life. \u2018The difference between me and Souness is this: Souness as a player, up there (raises arm). Jose as a player, down here. Jose as a manager, up here. Souness as a manager, down there.\u2019 With that the Chelsea manager pulled one of those faces that suggested the pair do not even belong on the same planet, let alone Souness having the right to pass comment on his team. It did not end there. Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher said the pressure Chelsea put on the referee was 'disgraceful' Carragher, Thierry Henry (centre) and Graeme Souness dissect Chelsea's exit from the Champions League . Mourinho added: \u2018I was not a frustrated man because I was not a top player. He is clearly a frustrated man. He was a fantastic player. I have lots of respect, in spite of some episodes, for a fantastic player with a fantastic career in a fantastic club with a top generation of players. \u2018You know the world is a bit strange \u2014 maybe with the diet and the quality of products we are eating, memories are getting shorter. \u2018When Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness speak, it\u2019s because they are having a problem for sure. Jamie stopped playing a couple of years ago and, in two years, he forgets everything he did on the pitch. Mr Souness also, but he stopped playing a long time ago. \u2018I coached Benfica, I know a lot about him, so much about him. But I\u2019m a certain kind of education, not just in football but in life, and I prefer to laugh.\u2019 Mourinho watches on as defender Kurt Zouma (left) prepares to play a ball during training on Friday . Chelsea striker Diego Costa keeps the ball up while sitting on the floor at the Cobham training ground . Chelsea players in training ahead of the Premier League game against Southampton on Sunday . Souness managed Benfica for two years, between 1997 and 1999; Mourinho was the Portuguese club\u2019s coach for a short spell between September 2000 and December 2000. Chelsea\u2019s manager was spiky on Friday, confrontational at times as he attempted to put a positive spin on a negative result in the last 16 of the Champions League. The guard dropped again when he claimed Chelsea would definitely win the Barclays Premier League and he went on to make a case that they should be \u2018eight, nine, 10, 11 or 12 points\u2019 clear of Manchester City. In public he is supporting his squad, although he was less than keen to divulge details of the 30-minute team meeting held at the training ground the day after their elimination. Souness was manager of Benfica in Portugal\u00a0for two years, between 1997 and 1999, before Mourinho . The Special One spent a brief fractious spell with the Lisbon club before moving on to better things . \u2018Nobody was shy,\u2019 was about the most he was prepared to say after he called his players together for a cathartic exercise that you can imagine ended with the squad accepting the blame. They certainly take responsibility for ill-discipline, with Mourinho revealing that his players pay the fines if they are charged by the authorities for mass confrontation or surrounding the referee. Chelsea were fined \u00a330,000 by the Premier League after they were charged following the behaviour of their players towards Jonathan Moss on February 11. Mourinho, preparing for Saturday's clash with Southampton at Stamford Bridge, added: \u2018If they surround the referee we are charged and we have to pay a fine, and if we do that the players pay the fine. Mourinho revealed his players pay fines if they are charged for mass confrontation or surrounding the referee . \u2018We have, in this moment, I think eight or nine months of competition and we were charged once. We paid for that. It\u2019s simple. Go to the Premier League and see how many teams were charged and how many times. Chelsea were charged once. \u2018Everybody would love to be in our position. We closed the chapter on the Champions League, but we still have the book to write. \u2018If you want to talk about the Champions League, speak with Wenger or Pellegrini. We have 11 more matches to finish the book. Let\u2019s see if the last page of the book is with the Premier League trophy in their hands.\u2019","highlights":"Chelsea were criticised by Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness on Sky .\nBut manager Jose Mourinho has hit back, calling out the two pundits .\nMourinho claimed that the pair were jealous of his coaching success .\nBlues boss refused to reveal detail of meeting after Champions League exit .\nMourinho says Chelsea should be \u2018eight, nine, 10, 11 or 12 points\u2019 clear of Manchester City at the top of the Barclays Premier League ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Cleanup crews on Thursday started assessing the damage caused by storms that slashed across Oklahoma on Wednesday, killing one person and injuring about two dozen others across the state. A reported tornado ravaged a mobile home park, destroying dozens of trailers just west of Tulsa in the suburb of Sand Springs. Authorities said the man who died at the River Oaks Mobile Home Park had been trying to help his father, who was injured, according to CNN affiliate KJRH. One woman at the mobile home park told KJRH that she was cooking when the storm hit. \"Within 5 minutes it was dark and the sirens were going off and you couldn't hear yourself think,\" Brandy Richards said.  \"And you just grab the kids and we ran across the street.  My best friend has the only house that's back there, and we barely got into the house and it took the garage.  It was so fast.\" \"It looks like there's been a little war zone around here,\" Tammi Hart told CNN affiliate KTUL. The storm flattened a Sand Springs gymnastics studio, where 60 kids and adults were huddled underground. \"We were just in the middle of practice and the sirens started going off and we just had to get all the kids to the basement,\" according instructor Kelsey Haggard, who said she heard a \"big boom\" when the building was hit. \"Just really happy everyone got out safe,\" said Haggard.  \"It was really scary ... it just seems so surreal.\" In addition to the death at the mobile home park, KTUL reported two other people were taken to the hospital in critical condition.  The Oklahoma State Department of Health said two dozen people were injured across the state, according to CNN affiliate KOKI. Storm damage was reported across the Tulsa metro area. Gov. Mary Fallin toured the damage in Sand Springs on Thursday and declared a state of emergency for 25 counties. \"Our hearts and prayers go out to the family that lost a loved one and certainly to those who were injured or lost their home or business,\" she said. Severe weather also tore through the Oklahoma City area, including Moore, which has seen more than its share of devastating storms.  A massive tornado hit Moore nearly two years ago, killing 24 people and injuring hundreds of others. The Moore Police Department said a 2-mile square area had significant damage, mainly roofs off homes and downed trees. Trees had to be cleared so law enforcement and emergency vehicles could get through. \"You know, this isn't the first time we've done this so ... unfortunately, we've gotten pretty good at getting people back into their residences as quick as we can,\" said Sgt. Jeremy Lewis with the city's police. Until Wednesday, there hadn't been a single report of a tornado in the United States during March. CNN meteorologist Judson Jones said there were preliminary reports of seven tornadoes on Wednesday.  An average year would produce 80 twisters in March, he said. March is typically a transitional month, where warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico collides with cold Arctic air to produce severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. This year, however, the jet stream pattern responsible for all the cold air and snow in the East had remained stuck in more of a winter mode. But that changed this week as an Arctic cold front began crashing to the south, bringing together the stormy mix. CNN's Sean Morris, AnneClaire Stapleton, Jeremy Grisham and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","highlights":"\"It looks like there's been a little war zone around here\"\nNational Weather Service:  There are preliminary reports of 7 tornadoes .\n\"It looks like there's been a little war zone around here,\" Oklahoma resident says ."}
{"article":"Alan Pardew has backed Crystal Palace defender Scott Dann to carry on improving and challenge for a place in the England squad in the near future. England boss Roy Hodgson opted for Phil Jagielka, Gary Cahill, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling as his four centre back for the upcoming internationals with Lithuania and Italy at the end of the month. But Dann has been in impressive form for Palace in recent months as they moved away from relegation danger. Scott Dann has been in brilliant form for Crystal Palace recently and could be in line for an England call . Alan Pardew has back his centre back to keep improving and draw Roy Hodgson's attention to him . But Pardew says that Dann, 28, has his best years ahead of him and can carry on improving. He said: \u2018He is a good age and is coming into his prime age as a centre half and he has a lot of experience under his belt at this level. \u2018He has not surprised me in terms of his character because he plays with an honesty in every game. He has been very impressive since I have been here and his confidence is high. He hit a pass out to a left winger at the weekend that Glenn Hoddle would have been proud of. \u2018He has some good players in front of him and they have a lot more experience at that top level than he does. \u2018I don\u2019t think he should be disappointed he has not made this squad. He is playing well at the moment and it is there for all to see. What will be, will be, but his best years are still in front of him.\u2019 For Pardew personally, he would love to see a Palace player called up to the England squad. Wilfried Zaha was the last Palace player to be called up to the England squad back in 2012 and Pardew says his players must find their place in the Premier League first.

Harry Kane\u2019s rapid assent into Hodgson\u2019s squad is something that Pardew admires and hopes he can unearth someone of his quality. He added: \u2018There have not been too many Palace players in the England squad in recent years and it would be nice to get someone in that squad. Sometimes when a team has just been promoted and you are in your second year, you have not got the foundations yet to be proven to show you are good enough at that level. Harry Kane has won a place in the England squad and Pardew has been impressed with his quick progress . \u2018Our boys are fighting for their status and you need to gain that. \u2018To be fair to Harry Kane he has done that in a very quick time at a top club, and that is difficult to do, so hats off to him. \u2018Lets hope we can produce someone of his ilk as he is a real example to players up and down the country.\u2019","highlights":"Alan Pardew says he would love to have players in the England squad .\nManager believes Scott Dan can continue to impress and win a place .\nPhil Jagielka, Gary Cahill, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling all in latest squad .\nWilfried Zaha was last Palace player to make England squad back in 2012 .\nPardew gives credit to Harry Kane for his rapid rise through the ranks ."}
{"article":"London (CNN)In his teenage years, there was little to set Mohammed Emwazi -- a quiet, hardworking boy with a few friends -- apart from his classmates. That's according to Joanna Shuter, his former head teacher at Quintin Kynaston Community Academy in northwest London. Now 26, Emwazi has gained international notoriety after being identified as the ISIS militant nicknamed \"Jihadi John\" who's appeared in beheading videos of Western hostages. But in his school days, it was a different matter. When he joined Quintin Kynaston at 14 or 15, he was little trouble himself but was the focus of some bullying. \"He was bullied a little, but because he was quiet and he was reserved ... generally he was fine,\" Shuter said. \"There were no massive behavior problems with him, and by the time he got into ... (his last years) he had settled, he was working hard, he achieved great grades for him, and he went to the university of his choice.\" He just didn't stand out as troubled, she said. \"If there had been any concerns about Mohammed, they would have been picked up, and we would have intervened and tried to support him in any way that we could have done.\" Born in Kuwait, but brought up in London from the age of 6, Emwazi was one of the school's many students from an immigrant background. The school's intake is 70% Muslim, said Shuter, with many students coming from large housing estates in what is a multicultural area of London. But its ethos was one of tolerance and integration, with all students encouraged to feel part of the school community. Staff made great efforts to get to know the 1,400 students in the school so that nobody would feel excluded or left behind, Shuter said. They also reached out to the sometimes insular, conservative Muslim communities that many of their students came from, she said, to try to help students who could feel torn between different cultures. Nonetheless, Emwazi was somehow drawn in by radical influences, most likely outside of school or through social media. And he was not alone. At least two other students who attended Quintin Kynaston also allegedly later turned to Islamist extremism. One, Mohammed Sakr, only overlapped at the school by a few months with Shuter. He was reportedly killed in a U.S. drone strike in Somalia in 2012. \"He was very outgoing, jolly, sporty kind of person and fun,\" Shuter said. Shuter sees social media as the greatest danger facing young people and their families today. \"I think social media is terrifying because it does have the power to influence young people in a way that as adults we have no power to control,\" she said. She still finds it hard to believe that Emwazi could be the apparent killer with the London accent recorded on ISIS videos. \"My blood just ran cold,\" she said of when she first heard the news. \"When I hear the name, I just find it incredible to marry what I've clearly seen on the TV with the person that I knew. It literally makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I can't believe what has happened to him and the influences that clearly have completely changed him. \"I think it's horrific, the idea that a young man like that could become somebody that people say is the poster boy for (ISIS). I just think it's shocking.\" The London-accented voice is all too familiar to anyone who's watched the videos released by ISIS of the killing of Western hostages. CAGE,  a London-based advocacy group that worked with Emwazi, has released audio of a phone conversation from 2009 in which he talks about members of the UK security services questioning him. They asked about his attitude toward the July 7, 2005, terror attacks in London and the 9\/11 attacks on the United States, he says. \"We're going to keep a close eye on you, Mohammed,\" he alleges they told him. CAGE has painted a picture of a young man driven to extremism by unwarranted harassment by security services. It says emails he sent the group paint a picture of a desperate man hounded by authorities who saw his plans for a new life crumble as he tried unsuccessfully to get help. But some analysts say the emails are only part of the story, arguing that investigators targeted Emwazi because they already saw he had links with terrorist groups.","highlights":"Mohammed Emwazi's ex-head teacher says he was a quiet boy, slightly bullied at school .\nShe says there was no sign during his school years that he was turning to radical Islam .\nAdvocacy group releases audio with Emwazi's complaints of security services' questioning ."}

The Champions League holders made it through to the quarter-finals despite losing the seven-goal thriller, taking the last-16 tie 5-4 on aggregate. But Bale was the subject of boos again with the home faithful seemingly losing patience with the former Tottenham star, and, along with some of his Real team-mates, was met with a wall of noise as he left the parking garage in Madrid. Gareth Bale appeared to be abused by Real Madrid fans as he left the Santiago Bernabeu on Tuesday night . Fans crowded around the parking garage following the 4-3 defeat by Schalke in the Champions League . One fan was heard yelling 'male prostitute Welshman' at the 25-year-old . Bale endured a frustrating evening on Tuesday night but Real still qualified for the quarter-finals . As he drove away, supporters appeared to abuse him, yelling: 'Son of b*****s! A******e! Gay!' before one said: 'Male prostitute Welshman.' Bale became the most expensive footballer in the world upon signing for the Galacticos in an \u00c2\u00a386million deal and was impressive in his first season, netting crucial goals in Copa del Rey and Champions League final victories. But as his second campaign has worn on, he has been labelled as a 'ball-hog' by sections of the Bernabeu crowd, with many voicing their anger when he doesn't pass to team-mate and Balon d'Or holder Cristiano Ronaldo. After the shock defeat on Tuesday night some supporters were waving white handkerchiefs in a form of protest, while Bale was criticsed after dragging a shot wide when in a good position in front of goal. Manchester United have been linked with a mega-swoop for the 25-year-old, though the Welshman insists he loves life in Madrid and will do anything to accomplish his dream.

Cristiano Ronaldo scored two goals for Madrid and was Carlo Ancelotti's star performer against the Bundesliga side, but even he told reporters he won't be speaking to the media until the end of the season as his side's struggles continue.

{"article":"(CNN)If it were easy, any company or government could do it. But flying an Ebola patient halfway around the world -- while keeping that person alive, and everyone safe -- is complicated. Probably no one knows that better than Phoenix Air, a Georgia-based company that is the go-to for transporting Ebola victims by air. Since August, it has made approximately 40 trips -- about half to Europe, the rest to the United States. \"We're like a fire truck sitting in the firehouse. The bell goes off and within a matter of hours we can be out the door and underway,\" said Dent Thompson, vice president and chief operations officer at Phoenix Air. He described the system that goes inside the company's modified Gulfstream G-III aircraft. It consists of three major elements: . Once the plane has landed and the patient has left, the whole system is sealed. The aircraft then flies to a high-security hanger in Cartersville, Georgia, where it undergoes a complete decontamination process, which can take up to 24 hours. Everything inside the liner, including the liner, is sterilized multiple times. The liner and everything in it is then removed, put in special boxes, and taken to a federally licensed incinerator where everything is destroyed. \"We like to say it's more sterile than the surface of the moon when we're done with it,\" Thompson said. Phoenix Air began developing its system way before the current Ebola outbreak. It worked with the Department of Defense and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to build a system that could safety transport patients with contagious diseases. Then, the main concerns were SARS, swine and bird flu. It took years to work out the kinks and get the system approved, and by the time the work was done, the need had sort of petered out. But Thompson said Phoenix Air held onto the system, knowing -- unfortunately -- the need would arise again. He got a call from the State Department in July. By August, the company had completed its first Ebola flight, safely delivering Dr. Kent Brantly to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. A few days later, it brought Nancy Writebol to the same hospital for treatment. And on and on and on. Thompson said other groups are now developing systems similar to Phoenix Air's, including the U.S. government. But so far, none has flown. \"Other organizations have built systems, but we're the ones still doing it,\" he said. More than 10,000 people have died in the Ebola outbreak, mostly in the countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.","highlights":"Georgia company equips plane to transport Ebola patients .\nDesign was developed when SARS, swine and bird flu were generating concern ."}
{"article":"(CNN)It recalled one of the most memorable moments in comic book history, but for critics on social media, one comic book cover went too far, and it's now been pulled. DC Comics pulled the cover for the upcoming \"Batgirl\" #41, which portrays the Joker threatening a frightened Batgirl with a gun, with \"Joker makeup\" on her mouth. The Twitter hashtag #changethecover had been trending since Friday, when the cover was revealed. It's a variant, aka an optional cover, which tends to grab the attention of collectors but won't be the main cover seen in most stores. For the month of June, DC's variant covers are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the iconic villain. The cover recalls Barbara \"Batgirl\" Gordon's encounter with the Joker in the classic story \"The Killing Joke.\" In it, he brutally attacked Barbara, kidnapping her, and it was heavily implied that she was sexually assaulted. After being shot, the character remained in a wheelchair for decades, until DC retconned Barbara's fate in 2011, allowing her to walk again and be Batgirl. The criticism of the cover spread over a few days, though others defended it with their own hashtags. DC Comics (owned by Time Warner, which also owns CNN) said in a statement late Monday that artist Rafael Albuquerque's cover was going to be pulled. \"Regardless if fans like Rafael Albuquerque's homage to Alan Moore's THE KILLING JOKE graphic novel from 25 years ago, or find it inconsistent with the current tonality of the Batgirl books -- threats of violence and harassment are wrong and have no place in comics or society,\" they said. \"We stand by our creative talent, and per Rafael's request, DC Comics will not publish the Batgirl variant. \" Albuquerque said in his own statement, \"My Batgirl variant cover artwork was designed to pay homage to a comic that I really admire, and I know is a favorite of many readers. 'The Killing Joke' is part of Batgirl's canon and artistically, I couldn't avoid portraying the traumatic relationship between Barbara Gordon and the Joker.\" He continued, \"For me, it was just a creepy cover that brought up something from the character's past that I was able to interpret artistically. But it has become clear, that for others, it touched a very important nerve. I respect these opinions and, despite whether the discussion is right or wrong, no opinion should be discredited. He concluded, \"My intention was never to hurt or upset anyone through my art. For that reason, I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled. I'm incredibly pleased that DC Comics is listening to my concerns and will not be publishing the cover art in June as previously announced.\" Albuquerque added in a tweet on Monday night that he was never threatened (the \"threats\" DC referenced were aimed at those objecting to the cover, per \"Batgirl\" writer Cameron Stewart). Stewart tweeted more: \"I stand behind Rafael as an artist and a friend, and think he made the right decision. The cover was not seen or approved by anyone on Team Batgirl and was completely at odds with what we are doing with the comic. So, we have the creators of the book and the artist himself all agreeing that the cover was inappropriate. There's no 'censorship' here.\" That didn't stop the controversy on social media. It was just the latest brouhaha involving portrayals of women in comic books and variant covers in particular. In September, Marvel Comics canceled future variant covers from artist Milo Manara after a \"Spider-Woman\" No. 1 variant cover caused an uproar for being \"over-sexualized.\" (The company later said there was no connection between the two events.)","highlights":"Comic book portraying character with Joker makeup and gun to her head has stirred controversy .\nCritics say it is too violent, creepy and out of step with the tone of the series .\nDC Comics says the scene recalls a memorable moment in Batgirl's canon ."}

{"article":"Paris (CNN)French police have arrested four people linked to Amedy Coulibaly, the gunman and hostage-taker at a Parisian kosher supermarket on January 9, a Paris prosecutor's spokesman said. A French policewoman is among the four taken into custody, French national police said. The policewoman worked at the Fort de Rosny-sous-Bois, northeast of Paris, the spokesman said. According to Le Figaro newspaper, the Fort de Rosny-sous-Bois is the location of an important intelligence center. Coulibaly killed four hostages in the grocery store before police shot and killed him. His attack followed one on the office of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. France has been under a heightened state of alert since January's terror attacks in Paris that killed 17 people. Brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi, authors of the deadly attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices, were killed days later after two violent standoffs. The brothers were accused of killing 12 people in a massacre at the magazine offices. Coulibaly, suspected in the slaying of a police officer, was killed by security forces after he shot and killed four hostages during the siege at the kosher market. Charlie Hebdo has a controversial history of depicting the Prophet Mohammed, often in an unfavorable light, which has angered many Muslims around the world. Earlier cartoons depicting Mohammed spurred protests and the burning of the magazine's office three years ago. Since the attack, European nations have carried out raids on suspected terror cells with links to ISIS in Syria.","highlights":"Four people connected to gunman Amedy Coulibaly have been arrested, official says .\nA policewoman is among those in custody ."}
{"article":"(CNN)In November 2002, the world was captivated by the biggest archaeological discovery ever made relating to Jesus: a 2,000 year-old ossuary -- or bone box -- bearing the tantalizing inscription in Aramaic: \"James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus.\" If it was true, this was the first physical evidence ever found of Jesus' existence. And yet, if this amazing ossuary was false, then it was one of the greatest forgeries in history. Underlying the question of the authenticity of the ossuary is an even bigger theological problem: whether or not Jesus actually had any brothers. Though the debate's origins are ancient, the answer still divides Catholics and Protestants. For Catholics, Mary, Joseph and Jesus are a family unit unto themselves. Yet Catholic theology also holds that Jesus was God's son, born of the virgin -- and that Mary did not give birth to other children, divine or otherwise. 'Finding Jesus': John the Baptist Q&A . So who are these \"brothers\" that the Gospel of Mark mentions? The Rev. James Martin, author of the book \"Jesus: A Pilgrimage,\" calls the relationship between James and Jesus \"very complicated.\" \"He's called clearly the brother of the Lord, and the Greek uses the common word for brother,\" Martin says. But Catholics also believe in Mary's perpetual virginity, so Martin surmises that James and the other brothers were Joseph's children from a prior marriage.\"It makes sense that Joseph would have been older and Mary was younger, so I see them in a sense as stepbrothers.\" Other Catholic scholars see James and Jesus  as cousins, an idea that began in the fourth century, when St. Jerome, who translated the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament into Latin, argued the point against the theologian Helvedius, who said Mary and Joseph had other children. 'Finding Jesus': Shroud of Turin Q&A . Jerome countered that these children were instead born to Mary of Clopas, Jesus' aunt. Jerome used his linguistic facility to argue that \"adelphios,\" the Greek word used for Jesus' brothers and sisters, could refer to cousins, as well as to siblings. Protestants, however, see Jesus' family as free of ambiguity, with Mary and Joseph having several children. One of them is Jesus -- but the question then becomes, which one? Ben Witherington III, professor of New Testament Interpretation at Asbury Theological Seminary, offers the Protestant view that Jesus and James were full brothers, with Jesus being the elder. \"The New Testament says nothing about Mary being a perpetual virgin, it says she virginally conceived Jesus, and it certainly implies that she went on to have more children after that, and his brothers and sisters are in fact his brothers and sisters,\" Witherington says. Is Judas in hell? Jesus is presented as the older brother who leaves the family and walks about in Galilee and Judea, has a ministry and leaves James and the other brothers and sisters in charge of the family, according to the scholar. What's more contentious for some Protestants, is the fact that Jesus, as the eldest in the family, essentially forsook his obligation as next-in-line to head the family after Joseph died. Instead he followed his divine destiny, as ordained by his father in heaven. 5 things you didn't know about Jesus . That left James to fill the void. Whatever he was -- brother, step-brother or cousin -- we know that James became important in the early Christian church because of his relation to Jesus. Paul, the apostle who transformed the new religion from a local phenomenon into a movement throughout the Roman Empire, says as much in his letter to the Galatians: . \"Then after three years I did go up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and stayed with him 15 days;  but I did not see any other apostle except James the Lord's brother.\" James and Peter and Paul were the prime movers of this new faith, with James the leader of the Jesus followers in Jerusalem until he was martyred in 64 CE, forgiving his killers with his last breath, just as his brother Jesus had done. Given his importance to the early Christian Church, why wouldn't he be connected to his brother, or even stepbrother, on the burial box containing his bones? Michael McKinley is co-author, with David Gibson, of \"Finding Jesus: Faith. Fact. Forgery.: Six Holy Objects That Tell the Remarkable Story of the Gospels.\"","highlights":"The Rev.

{"article":"Lenakel, Vanuatu (CNN)Jacobeth Nilah wails in pain in the storm-battered hospital. The 9-year-old girl suffered a head injury when the roof of her family home fell on top of her as Tropical Cyclone Pam raged over the South Pacific island where she lives. The storm, one of the most powerful ever to make landfall, killed her mother and brother. Now, Jacobeth's life hangs in the balance, says Dr. Lawrence Boe. If she's not airlifted soon, she could die in the stricken hospital whose equipment was damaged in the cyclone, the doctor told CNN on Tuesday. She needs surgery and a bed in an intensive care unit. Dr. Boe is the only doctor at the hospital, which is the only hospital on Tanna, one of more than 80 islands that make up the nation of Vanuatu. Cyclone Pam raked across the archipelago with 155 mph (250 kph) winds over the weekend, destroying thousands of homes and killing at least 11 people. The storm also cut off communications between the capital, Port Vila, and many of the outer islands like Tanna. That left Dr. Boe unable to reach anyone in the capital to ask for supplies or a medevac for Jacobeth, who lies in a room with dozens of other patients who were injured in the storm. Dr. Boe used a CNN satellite phone on Tuesday to raise the alarm. He said he thinks authorities are going to send some help. He listed to CNN some of the basic but vital resources the hospital is lacking: \"Water and food for the patients and some medical supplies to deal with the injuries. IV fluids and rehydration fluids for dehydration.\" \"Water would be number one on the list,\" he said. Tanna is an hour-long flight from the capital. And the town of Lenakel, where the hospital is situated, is another 45 minutes of rugged driving from the airstrip. Aid groups have expressed serious fears about the potential scale of the devastation left by the cyclone on the more remote islands of Vanuatu, where many people live in rickety homes made of thatch or metal sheets. The death toll currently stands at 11, according to Vanuatu authorities, five of them from Tanna. But officials say it will take days or even weeks to get a full picture of the destruction. The country's roughly 260,000 citizens are spread across about 65 inhabited islands. Vanuatu's President Baldwin Lonsdale has called Cyclone Pam \"a monster,\" saying it has set back the development of his country, already one of the poorest in the region, by years. One aid organization has said it could be one of the worst disasters ever to hit the Pacific. The storm flooded many of the wards of the hospital on Tanna, which lies near the southern end of the archipelago. Half of the hospital is unusable. As the cyclone pummeled the hospital and its surroundings, the patients cowered in two rooms. Uprooted trees now litter the building's surroundings. Its flagpole was snapped in half. Volunteer nurses have come to help the dozens of patients. One baby was born Monday and now lies on a bed in the ruined maternity ward. Her parents, Alina and Ron Loman, haven't chosen a name yet. They're just happy their child is healthy amid so much destruction. CNN's Ivan Watson reported from Lenakel, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Pamela Boykoff and Hilary Whiteman contributed to this report.","highlights":"A 9-year-old girl with head injuries urgently needs airlifting for surgery, doctor says .\nHe is the only doctor at the only hospital on the island of Tanna in Vanuatu .\nTropical Cyclone Pam has caused widespread damage across the island nation ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Iraqi forces appear to be slowly closing in on an important tactical victory against ISIS. But as they press forward in their attempt to retake the city of Tikrit from ISIS insurgents, there is an important question that the United States and its allies should be asking: Could this victory actually undermine the only sustainable strategy for ensuring Iraq's stability? The reality is that short-term tactical victories won't be enough to defeat ISIS, especially as the reliance on Iran-backed Shiite militias is only likely to exacerbate tensions with the largely local Sunni population. Indeed, the crucial ground war component of the campaign has so far been heavily reliant on the Shiite militias, whose track record of sectarian violence is well-documented, and their involvement threatens to drive more Iraqi Sunnis into the arms of ISIS. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said the involvement of these groups \"will only be a problem if it results in sectarianism.\" But based on past experience, many locals are understandably more frightened by their designated \"liberators\" than they are of the vicious extremists of ISIS who have ruled their towns over the past eight months. Historically, Iraq hasn't always needed Shiite militias under Iran's command to fight Sunni extremists. Al Qaeda was expelled from northern Iraq in 2007, when its harsh rule antagonized tribal leaders that had supported the anti-U.S. insurgency, prompting them to make common cause with the Americans in what became known as the \"Awakening\" movement. Unfortunately, once its goal had been achieved, Baghdad rounded on the Awakening, betraying promises of integration into the national army and polity and instead arresting and killing its leaders along with trusted Sunni elected representatives. The United States looked the other way, deeming it a \"domestic\" political matter. That simply emboldened then-Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to deepen his purge of Sunni elected representatives, and to parlay the 2010 election result into a governing coalition despite his own list drawing fewer votes than a rival bloc that included many Sunni leaders. This undermined the work that the United States had done in persuading Iraq's Sunnis that fighting al Qaeda and voting in elections was the best way to advance their communal interests. Put simply, al-Maliki's actions made a mockery of any Sunni confidence in the electoral system or the national government. It was the resulting Sunni alienation that allowed al Qaeda's successor, ISIS, back into those communities. The growing fear among many Sunnis has been compounded by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's statement to parliament that any Iraqi choosing to stay neutral was effectively aligning themselves with ISIS -- remarks that create an atmosphere that enables violence against ordinary Sunnis, many of whom feel caught between the extremists and a Shiite-led government from which they have been systematically oppressed and alienated. And ISIS has undoubtedly capitalized on the permissive environment created by such alienation, which persists despite the Obama administration having convinced itself that al-Abadi would somehow prove to be more inclusive than his predecessors from the same Shiite Islamist party. All this suggests that the \"Awakening\" experience, which showed that Iraqi Sunnis will reject violent extremists if they believe they will get a fair shake from the system for doing so, is as vital as ever to the prospects of defeating ISIS. But the outcome must be different from the last Awakening. Sunnis willing to fight ISIS should be given control over their own affairs in northern Iraq in the way that Kurdish aspirations have been accommodated. The alternative, of relying on sectarian forces to drive out the extremists, is more likely to ensure their return than to prevent it. Getting to a new political order in Iraq that offers the prospect of sustainable stability and progress will require compromise, not only among Iraqis but also among the regional sponsors of its contending factions -- Iraq has become a key battleground in the regional struggle between camps led by Iran and the Saudis. Creating a political order capable of stabilizing Iraq will require a new security \"grand bargain\" negotiated between the key stakeholders. Short-term tactical victories won't defeat ISIS, and militia involvement will more likely strengthen its appeal. The reality is that ultimately, only a political deal that guarantees Iraqi Sunnis' inclusion, equality and protection -- one that is implemented by Iran and its allied Iraqi militia -- can resolve the ISIS problem. And unless all of the key stakeholders are willing to negotiate a new way of living together, Iraq is likely to remain a battleground where the United States finds itself inadvertently reinforcing the problem.","highlights":"Iraqi forces have been involved in an offensive to retake Tikrit .\nRula Jebreal: Short-term tactical victories won't be enough to defeat ISIS ."}
{"article":"(CNN)The Iran nuclear negotiations in Lausanne, Switzerland, reportedly have made substantive progress, inching closer toward a provisional agreement between the P5+1 and Iran. While the talks continued to unfold this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu restated his concern about an agreement with Iran, vowing \"to continue to act against any threat.\" If an agreement is reached, the international spotlight will turn to Israel, in anticipation of its possible reaction. Israeli Defense Minister Moshe \"Bogy\" Yaalon stated that a deal is \"a tragedy for the whole world.\"  The question is, however, what can Israel really do once a deal is signed? In recent days, notable conservatives in the United States have attacked President Barack Obama's handling of the negotiations with Iran, arguing that a bad deal will force Israel's hand, leaving it with no choice but to attack Iranian targets. But is this a realistic conclusion? Israel's stated \"all options are on the table\" policy toward Iran has been in place for years and is based on the assumption that if a diplomatic solution to the nuclear problem cannot be reached or is not to its liking, Israel can decide to opt for a military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. Thirty-four years after the successful Israeli bombing of the Osirak nuclear facility in Iraq, military experts have little doubt that the Israeli Air Force today is capable of reaching Iranian airspace and bombing targets above and below ground. Therefore, the question is not one of military capability but more about  domestic political and geopolitical strategy. With an Iran deal in place, the Israeli leadership may face stern objections from the heads of the Israeli defense establishment, which will make it difficult but not impossible to take such a decision. Nevertheless, if it remains keen on pursuing a military option, the Israeli leadership will have to consider the following set of consequences that will likely result from such a decision: . \u2022A successful military strike on Iranian installations may degrade Iran's nuclear program, setting it back several years, but it would not completely eliminate Iran's nuclear capabilities.   Iran would likely be able to resume activity in new facilities soon after such an attack, with more international legitimacy to embark on a military nuclear program, in the face of future military challenges to its sovereignty and stability. A deal between the P5+1 (the United States, China, France, Russia, United Kingdom and Germany) and Iran is expected to include a 10-year (or more) \"sunset provision\" that is much longer than the period it will take Iran to get its program back on track in case of an Israeli attack. \u2022A military attack against Iran after a deal is signed would put Israel on a collision course with the P5+ 1, who were negotiating the contours of a deal with Iran, as well as with other members of the international community. Bilateral ties and cooperation with member states of the P5+1 may suffer, as well as intelligence sharing between the relevant intelligence agencies. In addition, countries are likely to seek ways to \"punish\" Israel for its actions, in the form of a U.N. General Assembly or Security Council resolution condemning Israeli behavior, calling for operative measures against the Jewish state. \u2022An Israeli attack would likely lead to the collapse of the international sanctions regime on Iran, which Israel has worked  to consolidate and which has been a very effective mechanism in pressuring Iran. \u2022The understanding between Israel and moderate Arab regimes on the need to prevent a nuclear Iran would not be likely to dissipate in the aftermath of an attack, but Israeli-Arab coordination and cooperation on this issue is bound to suffer. \u2022Finally, an Israeli attack would spark a direct Iranian military reaction against Israel, as well as an indirect reaction against Israel in the region by Iran's proxies Hezbollah (from Southern Lebanon and war-torn Syria) and Hamas (from Gaza and perhaps the West Bank) and against Israeli targets abroad. In the aftermath of a deal with Iran, Israel's response is expected to be harsh.  It will include strong public criticism of the deal, a vow to continue the fight against the agreement in the U.S. Congress and other relevant venues, a call for the international community to continue  the sanctions regime, and a pursuit of coordinated public messaging with moderate Arab regimes on this issue. These Israeli public diplomacy measures will be complemented by continued intelligence monitoring of Iran's activities in the nuclear sphere as well as its involvement in regional conflicts. Opting for a military strike against Iran, however, must take into consideration the consequences of such a decision. In light of all that is at stake, it does not seem like a plausible option at present.","highlights":"Dan Arbell: Israel's leaders can criticize a potential deal with Iran on its nuclear program .\nHe says a military option could set back Iran's nuclear program but would be too costly politically and diplomatically ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Families of children killed at the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut have filed lawsuits against the estate of the shooter's mother, saying Nancy Lanza was careless and negligent in leaving a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle unsecured in her home. Adam Lanza, 20, used the assault rifle to kill 20 first-grade students and six adults in Newtown on December 14, 2012. The younger Lanza was mentally unstable and used his mother's Bushmaster to kill her before he went on the rampage at the school, and then killed himself. At least eight lawsuits have been filed in Connecticut courts since January on behalf of relatives of 16 people killed in the massacre -- four adults and 12 children. Court documents also list two people who suffered serious injuries. In December, the parents of nine children killed at the mass shooting, along with one teacher who survived, filed a separate lawsuit against the businesses behind the Bushmaster rifle. Report finds missed chances to help Newtown shooter . The wrongful death lawsuit, filed one day after the second anniversary of the killings, named Camfour, a gun distributor; Riverview Gun Sales;  as well as the Freedom Group, the company that owns Bushmaster. It blamed the numerous lives lost in just 264 seconds on the shooter's weapon of choice, the Bushmaster. Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder, the law firm for the families in the Bushmaster lawsuit, is also representing some families in the cases against Lanza's estate. The lawsuits were first reported Friday in the Connecticut Post, which said Nancy Lanza is believed to have had insurance on the home worth more than $1 million. \"Unlike our case against Bushmaster, Camfour (the distributor), and Riverview for the negligent entrustment and marketing of combat AR-15's designed for the military to inflict mass casualties against the enemy to civilians like Nancy Lanza, we expect this claim to be resolved quickly,\" attorney Josh Koskoff said of the estate lawsuits.

{"article":"(CNN)Three French sports stars were among 10 people killed when two helicopters collided in Argentina on Monday evening, authorities said. The helicopters were reported to be heading to a gorge in northwestern Argentina for the filming of the reality TV show \"Dropped\" for the French broadcaster TF1. Eight French passengers and the choppers' two Argentinian pilots died in the midair crash near the town of Villa Castelli in La Rioja province, Argentina's state news agency Telam reported, citing local authorities. The dead included the famed sailor Florence Arthaud, who in 1990 broke the record for crossing the North Atlantic alone; the swimmer Camille Muffat, who won three medals at the 2012 Olympics in London; and the boxer Alexis Vastine, who won a bronze medal at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. Members of the TV production team were among the other French victims, French authorities said. Former French soccer star Sylvain Wiltord, a contestant on the show who wasn't involved in the crash, expressed his shock. \"I'm sad for my friends,\" he tweeted. \"I'm shaking, I'm horrified, I'm lost for words.\" Muffat's boyfriend, William Forgues, told CNN's French affiliate BFMTV of his shock at hearing the news of the 25-year-old swimmer's death. Clearly emotional, he said her agent had called him soon after midnight, herself in tears, to tell him of the crash. Muffat, he said, was known as \"madame 100%\" because she succeeded in so many things. He said she was happy and satisfied to be taking part in the show. \"To be over there was her choice, 100%,\" he said. At the 2012 London Olympics, Muffat won the gold medal in the 400-meter freestyle, silver in the 200-meter freestyle and bronze in the 4\u00d7200-meter freestyle relay. French President Francois Hollande expressed his condolences to the families of the victims in a statement. The sports stars \"made France shine so brightly\" during their careers, the statement said. The crash happened within moments of takeoff in good weather conditions, Telam reported, citing witnesses who spoke to a local radio station. The helicopters, which belonged to local governments in the region, collided about 100 meters (328 feet) above the ground, the news agency said. Police and investigators were at the scene of the crash. A manslaughter investigation has been opened in France into the incident, to be led by the Air Transport Gendarmerie, a representative for the Paris prosecutor's office said Tuesday.

If you don't like these, go to this Google Form (yeah, Google) and suggest a solution of your own. Your ideas may end up in a future column. (Side note: Google declined to comment on \"The poor kids of Silicon Valley.\" Facebook and Apple, meanwhile, did not respond to my repeated email requests for comment.) The idea: Housing is too expensive for poor families, especially in markets such as Silicon Valley. But making affordable housing more available can reduce this burden. Evidence it works: Increasing federal housing subsidies would reduce U.S. child poverty by 20.8%, according to a 2015 Children's Defense Fund report. That would lift 2.3 million kids out of poverty. The annual cost would be $23.5 billion. For more info, read this report: \"Ending Child Poverty Now.\" What you can do: Support vetted California organizations that provide free or subsidized housing to low-income families, including Family Supportive Housing and Samaritan House. Or: Petition Facebook, Apple or Google to fund subsidized housing projects in their own backyard. The idea: Working families can't afford to raise their kids, and better wages would help them do it. The federal minimum wage is worth considerably less now than it was in the 1960s, adjusted for inflation, according to the Congressional Research Service. The federal minimum wage was worth $9.27 in 1963, using July 2013 dollars. Now it's $7.25. Evidence it works: Raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour, and boosting the tipped worker wage to $7.07, could reduce U.S. child poverty by 4%, according to the Children's Defense Fund report. That would help lift 400,000 American kids out of poverty. To see how something like that plays out, I visited the Idaho-Washington border. Idaho's minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. Washington's is $9.47. The difference is $4,618 per year. On my visit, I met Amanda Palmen, a 27-year-old gas station worker. She told me that that wage difference is enough to help her two girls more comfortably -- and get off the SNAP program. What you can do: Petition for a $10.10 federal minimum wage. And learn more about minimum wage laws in your state. The idea: Kids who attend high-quality preschools are more likely to graduate from high school and tend to earn more as adults. Every child should have that chance. Additionally, expanding child care subsidies could help. Spending $5.3 billion would reduce U.S. child poverty by 3%, or 300,000 kids, according to the Children's Defense Fund report. Evidence it works: Meet the poorest kids in Iceland, a country with a low child poverty rate and nearly universal enrollment in early education, starting at age 2. In America, meanwhile, despite advances in many states, only 40% of 3-year-olds are enrolled. (Rates do go up for 4- and 5-year-olds, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.) Petition in favor of \"preschool for all.\" Or support these vetted groups: . The idea: The thing poor families lack is money. Give it to them and let them decide how to spend it. Evidence it works: Cherokee, North Carolina, pays tribal members a biannual stipend, just for being alive. And social ills have declined. The money comes from a casino, which the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation owns. In 1996, the tribal council voted to distribute 50% of the casino profits evenly among its 15,000 members, according to Vice Chief Larry Blythe. A Duke University researcher has been studying the impact of these payments for two decades. She follows 1,420 kids, comparing the lives of those who get the casino money with those who don't. The results are startling. For the poorest families, a yearly $4,000 payment reduced by 22% the odds that children would commit minor crimes by their late teens. The poorest kids were one grade year ahead when researchers checked in with them at 21. Mental health also improved. Kids who were lifted out of poverty by the payments saw behavioral problems decrease by 40%.

{"article":"A volunteer middle school basketball coach has been charged with having inappropriate sexual contact with one of her 14-year-old players during a team sleepover, authorities said. Shakyla Wilson, 22, of Naperville, Illinois, was charged with one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, according to DuPage County prosecutors. The abuse reportedly happened on February 20 at a player's residence after Wilson accompanied some of the girls from the Hill Middle School basketball team to a movie and spent the night at the sleepover, authorities said. Shakyla Wilson, 22, was charged with one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse after being accused of\u00a0having inappropriate sexual contact with a Hill Middle School basketball team sleepover. She was a volunteer coach with the team . Wilson, also known as Kiki, began volunteering with the team in an unpaid, unofficial capacity at the end of January, Indian Prairie School District Superintendent Karen Sullivan said in a statement on the district's website. The district immediately notified police when officials became aware of allegations and told Wilson she could not be on school property, Sullivan said. She added: 'We want to stress that the district takes these charges very seriously. As this is now a matter for law enforcement officials to handle, we encourage anyone who may have pertinent information regarding this investigation to contact the Naperville Police Department. 'We are providing support in the school for any student who may need to discuss this issue. If your student wishes to talk with someone at school, please direct him or her to speak with their social worker or guidance counselor.' Naperville Police Chief Robert Marshall told the Chicago Tribune that he was 'deeply disturbed' by the recent events. 'Ms Wilson purposely put herself in a position of influence and trust in order to prey on the innocence of young girls,' he said. State's Attorney Robert Berlin said that the allegations against Wilson are appalling. 'A coach's role is to motivate and inspire athletes to be the best they can be, both on the court and off it,' he told the Tribune. 'Coaches are there to help athletes attain their goals, not to take advantage of the trust their position holds just to satisfy their own sickening desires.' Wilson was an unpaid, unofficial volunteer girls basketball coach at Hill Middle School in Naperville, Illinois. She played basketball with the same team when she was in middle school . Though the district does not fingerprint volunteers at elementary or middle school levels, it does background checks through the Raptor system, which is used by 12,000 schools across the United States, according to the Tribune. The program screens a person's driver's license information to find registered sex offenders, Janet Buglio, director of communication services in the district said. 'Everyone entering our schools, including parents and volunteers, surrender their driver's license every time they enter a school to be used for a screening using the Raptor system,' she said. Wilson played basketball on two high schools state championship teams before joining the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee team for a year. She then transferred to St Joseph's College where she played basketball for two years. Before entering high school, she played basketball at Hill Middle School, the same place she was volunteering in January and February. Bail was set Friday at $100,000 and Wilson is due in court on March 24.","highlights":"Shakyla Wilson, 22, was a coach at Hill Middle School in Naperville, Illinois .\nShe began working in an unpaid, unofficial capacity in January .\nThe abuse reportedly happened on February 20 at a player's residence .\nWilson had allegedly accompanied some of the girls  to a movie before attending the team sleepover .\nShe was charged with one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse .\nBail was set Friday at $100,000 and Wilson is due in court on March 24 ."}
{"article":"Tim Sherwood's arrival at Aston Villa has given the squad a new lease of life, according to experienced goalkeeper Shay Given. After a disappointing start to his reign, in which the Villans lost two Premier League games in a row, Sherwood has turned it around with two Midlands derby wins over West Brom, first in the league and then in the quarter finals of the FA Cup. And Given, who was in goal for the latter of the two victories, admits that at half-time in Saturday's match, Sherwood wasn't pleased with his side's performance. Tim Sherwood has produced two consecutive victories against West Brom; in the league and FA Cup . Aston Villa players celebrate after Fabian Delph opened the scoring in the FA Cup quarter-final on Saturday . 'He wasn't too happy at half-time,' Given told Stan Collymore on talkSPORT. 'The flip-chart went flying in the dressing room and I think you saw our reaction in the second half, we were much better and caused West Brom a lot of problems. 'But that's what he's there to do. He's given us a rollicking when we've needed it and that's probably the first time he's really let go. I think a few of the lads were a bit shocked, but it got the reaction we needed.' Given and Sherwood have history, too. As a player, the now Villa manager won the Premier League title with Blackburn, and a young Given was also in the squad. Shay Given, who was in goal for the FA Cup win, was quick to praise the Villans' new manager post-match . Gabriel Agbonlahor gestures in celebration towards the Villa fans, who were delighted with the derby win . 'I know Tim from our Blackburn days,' Given continued. 'We were players together and he was a leader then as the captain, he captained Blackburn to the Premier League title, and he's very much the same. 'He's so positive on the training ground, so positive in the stadium and the players are responding to that.' Villa's league win over Tony Pulis' West Brom put some breathing space between them and the bottom three, but there is still a long way to go if they are to avoid the drop. According to Given, Sherwood was a leader on the pitch with Blackburn and he is the same as a manager .

{"article":"(CNN)Pope Francis has said that all he wants is to go out one day to a pizzeria \"without being recognized.\" Wishful thinking, perhaps. But when you're the the leader of the Catholic world pizza comes to you. Pizzeria owner Enzo Cacialli personally handed the pope a pie on Sunday as his motorcade drove through Naples. But, not just any pizza: a Naples-style thin crust creation with \"Il Papa\" spelled out in dough and topped with yellow cherry tomatoes, a reference to the Vatican flag. A video shows Cacialli, co-owner of Pizzeria Don Ernesto, hopping a barrier with the pie in hand as the Popemobile approaches. \"Papa! Papa!\" he yelled as he ran toward the open-top vehicle, apparently unimpeded by papal minders. The video shows Pope Francis reaching down and receiving the offering. After the hand off Cacialli pumps his fist in the air, victorious, as the crowd cheers. \"I gave him the pizza and with a smile he said 'thank you,'\" Cacialli told CNN. Cacialli comes from a pizza-making family. His says his father made a pizza for President Bill Clinton when he visited Naples in 1994. When Cacialli learned Pope Francis was going to be in town he decided to follow in his father's footsteps. \"It's really hard for me to understand what I managed to do,\" Cacialli said. \"Giving a pizza you made with your own hands to the Pope is very emotional. It's really hard for me to express the value of this gesture for a man we really love and value, for a beautiful person full of humanity.\" Cacialli is still waiting to hear whether Pope Francis enjoyed the edible offering.","highlights":"Pizza maker Enzo Cacialli hands Pope Francis pie as motorcade drives through Naples .\nPie was topped with yellow cherry tomatoes, had \"Il Papa\" spelled out in dough ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Four years ago I was laughed out of the room when I said to a group of friends: \"Pretty soon guys are going to decide their lives are more important than playing in the NFL. And they are going to stop playing.\" My friends accused me of going soft, being an elitist, being overly PC. Today, I'm certain they are not saying those things about the talented 49er linebacker Chris Borland, the latest NFLer to quit. He's 24 years old and the first player to retire directly because he wanted to avoid the traumatic brain injuries that have been linked to playing football. Borland played just one NFL season. \"I just honestly want to do what's best for my health,\" he told ESPN's \"Outside the Lines.\" \"From what I've researched and what I've experienced, I don't think it's worth the risk.\" He added: \"I just thought to myself, 'What am I doing? Is this how I'm going to live my adult life, banging my head, especially with what I've learned and knew about the dangers?' \" His teammate, Pro Bowl linebacker Patrick Willis, made the decision to walk away last week, and you can't help but think his decision might have influenced Borland. Willis says he isn't really sure what he'll do next, but he knows he won't play another game in the National Football League. Although fans around the globe are begging the 30-year-old, seven-time Pro Bowler to \"unretire,\" Willis said his nagging foot and ankle injuries, and a desire for a happy life are why he walked away. \"I have no regrets,\" said a tearful Willis in his press conference last week. \"I gave this game everything I had and I am truly blessed. ... Honestly, I pay attention to guys when they're finished playing, walking around like they've got no hips and they can't play with their kids. They can barely walk. \"People see that and they feel sorry,\" Willis said. \"But they don't realize it's because he played a few extra years.\" Willis, who has a degree in criminology from Ole Miss, is a wise man. And while many sports fans are in shock that any guy lucky enough to play in the NFL would just walk away from fame and wealth, it sounds to me like Willis has his priorities right. It's refreshing. And Willis is not alone. At a time of year when most football fans are consumed by trade rumors and free agency moves, several other high-profile players have decided to hang up their cleats. And what's surprising is how young they are: . At 27, Steelers linebacker Jason Worilds was soon to step into the crazy world of free agency, where he was sure to be in demand by many teams. It looked like he was just about to get his huge payday. But instead, he's leaving the game. Unlike Willis, Worilds hadn't been plagued by injuries, at least not yet. And he'd only missed one game in the past three seasons. So why did he leave? He wants to do other things, he said. Tennessee Titans quarterback Jake Locker, 26, announced he's also retiring after just four seasons. Another Pro Bowler who had been haunted by injuries, running back Maurice Jones-Drew, 29, called it quits in Oakland recently. He lasted nine years. Young, intelligent and charismatic, \"MJD\" was adored by fans until, like so many other elite players, he was slowed down by injuries. Jones-Drew, whom I worked with a lot when he was starting out in the league, is a smart and personable guy. It was clear when I met him that he was talented enough to succeed at anything he pursued. \"Football has been a central part of my life for the past 24 years,\" Jones-Drew wrote when announcing his retirement on Twitter. \"But now I'm excited about and looking forward to the next chapter of my life.\" Who knows, maybe MJD is the next Michael Strahan? That former New York Giant's successful exit from football has inspired so many younger players. Strahan's path has empowered others to value themselves beyond football. Every season, I get calls from NFLers who want my help finding a career after football. \"How do I do what Mike did; that's what I want to do,\" they say. Once dubbed the \"sack master,\" Strahan has transformed himself into such a daytime TV media darling you would think he was born to co-host ABC's \"Live With Kelly & Michael.\" But even he had to decide when to quit the game before it got the best of him. It took 15 years. I will never forget how hobbled Strahan looked one early morning when an ESPN crew showed up at his door to do a \"day-in-life\" story on his off day. Bruised and still bloody that morning, he could barely get out of bed. Usually loquacious, he had trouble even talking because his swollen jaw was locked shut. He couldn't even brush his teeth properly. Shave? Forget it: hands too gnarly. And it was clear he had a severe migraine working his brain. There were very few laughs that day. Strahan was barely 30 then, and he looked like a defeated, old man. Now, every time I see him smiling for the cameras, I think how blessed he is to be healthy and enjoying his life after football. So maybe there is another way out for young players who are now better informed about the dangers of the game. Just maybe all the debates about the ugly side of football -- concussions, brain injuries, depression and suicides-- have done some good, after all. Today, a guy like Patrick Willis can walk away from the game a happy man: . \"If I want to go fishing tomorrow, I'm going to go fishing. ... If I want to go home and watch my little brother play baseball, I can go to do that. ... Life is amazing right now.\"","highlights":"Roxanne Jones: Several NFL players just beginning their careers, including Chris Borland, are walking away .\nSome say they're leaving for new opportunities, Jones says .\nBut maybe the news about football's serious injuries is getting through, she says ."}

{"article":"(CNN)ISIS militants in northern Syria released 19 Assyrian Christian hostages on Sunday, according to Rami Abdelrahman, the chief of the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Abdelrahman has a network of activists on the ground in Syria. On Saturday, the observatory -- citing an Assyrian commander -- said that ISIS planned to release 29 Assyrian Christian hostages. ISIS captured at least 220 Assyrians, all Christians, on February 23 during an attack on the villages around the town of Tal Tamer in the northern Syrian province of al-Hasakah. The Syrian Observatory said Saturday that a self-proclaimed ISIS court ordered the release, citing an Assyrian commander. The \"court\" told the commander that the fate of the other kidnapped Assyrians has yet to be decided by ISIS Sharia jurists. The Syrian Observatory said its information indicates ISIS has taken the hostages to the Mount Abdelaziz area, southwest of Tal Tamer. The founder of the Assyrian Human Rights Network, Osama Edward, puts the number of Assyrian hostages at more than 262. Edward is based in Sweden but has family in the area that was attacked, and says his information is from the network's team on the ground. The number of hostages has climbed steadily, from an initial estimate of between 70 and 100 people seized on Monday to 150 as of Wednesday, with women, children and the elderly among them. The number of people executed by the terrorist group has also climbed steadily. Since the declaration of its \"caliphate\" last June, ISIS has killed 1,969 people, the Syrian Observatory said Saturday. Nearly two-thirds of them -- 1,238 people -- were civilians. Six were children and eight were women, the group said. Of the rest, 95 were fighters from the al Qaeda-affiliated rebel group al-Nusra Front, the Syrian Observatory said, and 511 were officers and soldiers of regime forces. ISIS also executed 125 of its own members for \"exceeding the limits in religion,\" the Syrian Observatory said. \"We in SOHR believe that the real number of people that had been killed by (ISIS) is higher than the number documented by SOHR because there are hundreds of missing and detainees inside the (ISIS) jails, loss of communication with about 1,000 men of al-Shaitaat tribe, (and) dozens of Kurds who have still been missing\" since ISIS attacked the Syrian town of Kobani in September.

{"article":"Hong Kong (CNN)China says its military budget will increase by 10.1% in 2015, the latest in a series of double-digit increases that will narrow the still-significant gap with the United States on defense spending. According to a budget report released at the start of China's National People's Congress - the annual meeting of the country's rubber stamp parliament -- defense spending will total 887 billion yuan ($144.2 billion) this year. \"Building a solid national defense and strong armed forces is fundamental to safeguarding China's sovereignty,\" Premier Li Keqiang told thousands of delegates gathered in the cavernous Great Hall of the People in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. The increase underscores China's intention to prioritize military spending even as economic growth slows. It also comes amid unease among China's neighbors about the pursuit of its territorial claims in the South China Sea and East China Sea. Traditionally, the People's Liberation Army army has been focused on protecting its own borders, but recent missions have seen it join U.N. peacekeeping efforts in places like South Sudan, and fighting piracy in Somalia. Analysts say that China's spending on defense is notoriously opaque and the budget includes paramilitary forces such as the People's Armed Police as well as the People's Liberation Army, Navy and Air Force. Paul Burton, Asia Pacific director at IHS Aerospace, Defence & Security, estimates that actual spending is 35% higher than the announced budget. \"China's expanding strategic reach and extensive modernization requirements will continue to require significant investment over the next decade,\" Burton said. China's defense budget is still dwarfed by what the U.S. spends on its military -- $598 billion, according to 2014 figures provided by IHS. But, while China's budget has increased by double digits every year since 2010, U.S. spending has declined since then. China's defense budget grew by 12.7% in 2011, 11.2% in 2012, and 10.7% in 2013, according to China's state news agency Xinhua. Alexander Neill, a senior fellow at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in Singapore says China is likely to prioritize spending on its naval power -- its force has traditionally been focused on winning land battles. \"A growing chunk of budget is going toward China's navy, particularly its submarine force and its seaborne nuclear deterrent,\" he said. China's first aircraft carrier went into service in 2012 and a second is thought to be under construction. Neill also said that the PLA is likely to make its pay more competitive to attract higher quality recruits, such as college graduates. A U.S. congressional report released last month said that many are still drawn from rural areas with limited education. It added that the country's one-child policy, which has created the \"little emperor\" phenomenon of spoiled children, produces recruits who \"may not be tough enough to withstand military discipline,\" the report added. \"Serving in the military, in a Chinese cultural sense, is not a sought-after professional career,\" Neill said. \"If the PLA can offer competitive salaries, they may be able to attract a new stratum of specialist talent.\" CNN's Jason Kwok designed the graphics in this report.","highlights":"China says its military spending will increase by 10.1% in 2015 .\nChina prioritizing military spending even as economic growth slows .\nSpending likely to focus on China's naval force ."}

{"article":"Kevin Pietersen remains as far away as ever from a return to England colours after it emerged on Friday that Surrey are no nearer an agreement to re-sign the maverick star. Sportsmail can reveal that Pietersen has told Surrey, who released him at the end of last summer, that he will not play all county cricket for them next season \u2014 even though he was urged to do so when offered a lifeline by new ECB chairman Colin Graves. He appeared to call Pietersen\u2019s bluff by saying the 34-year-old would be considered for an England recall if he threw his lot in with a county and stated his case by scoring heavily in domestic cricket. Kevin Pietersen played for Surrey in last year's Natwest Twenty20 Blast . Yet it seems unlikely the county will be Surrey, who have not been able to reach agreement with Pietersen over a deal to play in red-ball cricket as well as the white-ball game. The fact Pietersen struggled to attract a contract in this year\u2019s Indian Premier League, before Sunrisers Hyderabad signed him in a cut-price deal, seemed to suggest the path may be clear for a return to domestic cricket. But unless Pietersen is prepared to move away from London \u2014 something he previously stated he would not do \u2014 it seems that his options are diminishing. Leicestershire may take on Pietersen but it remains to be seen if he will deign to play in the second division. A return for Pietersen in England colours (above) is now looking more and more unlikely . Somerset, coached by Pietersen\u2019s friend Matt Maynard, remain an option but the odds are against him being given a platform to stake a claim for England. Graves, who does not succeed Giles Clarke as chairman until May 15, appeared to go against the wishes of senior figures in the England set-up when he seemed to endorse a Pietersen recall.

The Magpies are 11th in the Premier League table having escaped with a 1-0 win over relegation threatened Aston Villa on Saturday. Shearer, who scored over 200 goals for Newcastle, believes the St James' Park faithful will consider giving up their season tickets soon because of the lack of investment and hope. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley was among the crowd of spectators at St James' Park on Saturday . 'There is no excitement, no anticipation. It takes its toll, even on the most loyal fans in the country. Fans want to dream their team can be successful, whether that's in a domestic cup competition or in Europe,' Shearer told the Telegraph. 'Newcastle fans at the minute are showing why they are some of the best around, because they can't dream. They've been told the cups aren't a priority, that finishing 10th in the Premier League is more important.' The former striker calls for squad investment in the summer but doubts much will change under current owner Mike Ashley, and insists the club should pursue Cup glory more seriously. Newcastle legend, now a pundit with Match of the Day, has criticised the club's lack of ambition . Despite his injury problems Papiss Cisse has become a crucial player for John Carver at Newcastle . 'Unless the club are going to bring in a load of exciting players in the summer, which is highly unlikely when you look at the way it's been run, then I think people might look at giving up. I can only tell you what my mates are thinking about doing because of the lack of hope at the minute,' added Shearer . 'I'd dearly love us to have a cup run, I'd dearly love us to get to Wembley again, I'd much rather that than just finish in mid-table year after year. 'It's not going to happen because we've played a weakened team in every cup game. They've been playing weakened teams in cup competitions since 2007.' Cisse draws the congratulations after scoring the winner for Newcastle against Aston Villa on Saturday . The Senegalese international made a beeline for Jonas Gutierrez to celebrate his winning goal .

{"article":"(CNN)The collapse of marriage in our poorest communities -- and its tragic impact -- is a familiar story. But increasingly, marriage is becoming a marker of class privilege in America, something increasingly reserved for the affluent. If progressives want to tackle the scourge of inequality, then the retreat from marriage is an issue they can't ignore. The reality is that the retreat from marriage is pervading the working middle class -- the two-thirds of Americans without a college degree. This is occurring even as in upscale America, marital bonds remain comparatively strong. \"This is the marriage gap, and it's something new in America,\" declares a manifesto on \"marriage opportunity\" unveiled in a recent Washington Monthly cover story. It was penned by four astute social and political analysts, David Blankenhorn, Jonathan Rauch, Barbara Dafoe Whitehead and Bill Galston. (Full disclosure: I'm a signer of their statement.) \"Over the past several decades, the norm of marriage has eroded across all economic and educational classes, but much less among the elite,\" they write. \"But for millions of middle- and lower-class Americans, marriage is increasingly beyond reach, creating more fractured and difficult family lives, more economic insecurity for single parents, less social mobility for those on the lower rungs of the economic ladder, more childhood stress, and a fraying of our common culture.\" True, overall U.S. marriage rates have fallen from 72% of U.S. adults in 1960 to just 51% in 2012, according to The Economist. But drill a little deeper into the data, and a marital class divide emerges. Less than half of men with high school degrees are married, compared with 76% of men with college degrees. The pattern is similar among women, except that those with graduate degrees have somewhat lower marriage rates than those with four-year college degrees. And because the college-educated tend to look for mates with similar education and earning power, their unions push them even higher up the income scale -- further widening the economic gulf between marital haves and have-nots. Marriage in America, it seems, is becoming another luxury item for economic elites to enjoy. So why should we worry? \"Declining marriage rates may not be concerning on their own, but while Americans are forgoing marriage, they are not forgoing childbearing,\" say Isabel Sawhill and Joanna Venator of the Brookings Institution. More than 40% of children are born outside wedlock today (including nearly three-quarters of black children). And a raft of social research shows that children who grow up in married, two-parent families do better in school and in life than those who don't. It's true that more children are being raised by cohabiting couples, but in the United States (unlike some European countries) these relationships tend to be unstable and short-lived. Some see the decline of marriage as stemming from a tectonic cultural shift -- the rise of feminism and the surge of women into work -- that has blurred the old division of familial labor between male breadwinners and female homemakers. But economic changes, mainly the disappearance of manufacturing jobs, automation and wage stagnation, have played a big part in the story, too. Liberals are eager to talk about their favorite economic fixes for inequality: raising the minimum wage, bolstering unions and taxing the rich to pay for new social benefits for families of modest means. But they seem uncomfortable talking about marriage, which is seen as an unwelcome distraction from issues of economic power. It's tempting to blame such reticence on President George W. Bush's ill-fated Healthy Marriage Initiative, which triggered a flurry of new federal marriage promotion programs over the previous decade. A centerpiece of Bush's \"compassionate conservatism,\" the initiative managed to polarize the social policy community while having a negligible impact on falling marriage rates. In truth, though, liberals have a long tradition -- at least since Daniel Patrick Moynihan's warnings in the 1960s of the consequences of family breakdown in black communities -- of shying away from \"cultural\" explanations for poverty and inequality. They need to get over it. Inequality as we know it today arises from the intricate interplay of economic and cultural changes, and won't be reversed simply by redistributing income from affluent to downscale families. High marriage rates in upper middle-class America make the link between family structure and economic success abundantly clear. For example, economists Robert Lerman and W. Bradford Wilcox estimate that the median income of families with children would be 44% higher today if America had the same marriage rates we had in 1980. Today, a record number of Americans -- one in five adults 25 and older -- have never been married. It's probably not because our society is evolving away from a fundamental social institution that has endured for, oh, most of human history. In fact, researchers say aspirations to marriage are as high as ever, but the practical barriers are getting harder to surmount. Which brings us back to the \"marriage opportunity\" manifesto. Rather than actively promoting marriage -- something government has shown it doesn't really know how to do -- the opportunity agenda aims at removing impediments to marriage, especially for non-elite Americans. This includes a raft of familiar policy proposals for boosting the economic prospects of low-income workers and making taxes more family-friendly. Intriguingly, the four authors point to the one cultural shift that's bucking the trend toward diminishing demand for weddings -- the public's dramatic turnaround on same-sex marriage. They envision a possible political bargain in which conservatives accept gays as allies in fortifying marriage, and liberals recognize that family breakdown is magnifying America's disparities of wealth and income. Could expanding marriage opportunity really become common ground in America's intensely polarized culture wars? It seems like an extravagant hope. But Blankenhorn and company are emphatically right that both progressives and conservatives have a big stake in reversing the retreat from marriage.","highlights":"Will Marshall: Retreat from marriage is pervading the working middle class .\nMarriage in America is becoming another luxury item for economic elites, he says ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Brace yourself Europe -- \"Moneyball\" is coming to a football pitch near you. Spend-thrift baseball executive Billy Beane -- made famous by Brad Pitt's Oscar-nominated portrayal in \"Moneyball\" -- is taking up a position with Dutch club AZ Alkmaar. \"I'm truly excited for the opportunity to be part of AZ Alkmaar in an advisory role,\" Beane told the AZ website. \"Despite being a great football club with a storied history, they face many of the challenges we have with the Oakland A's. My love for football and AZ's vision of the future of the club made this an attractive pursuit.\" The idea behind \"Moneyball\" is to obtain maximum value for each player bought or sold. Beane has had a longstanding fascination with European football, citing Arsenal's Arsene Wenger as a manager he admires for his blend of performance on the pitch and financial prudence. The American has said in the past that it was his dream to be an executive at a football club once his baseball career ended.  It turns out he didn't have to wait that long. \"I think it's interesting and exciting for him personally,\" said Chris Anderson, co-founder of the sports analytics consultancy Anderson Sally. \"He's been a football fan for many, many years and is very well informed about the sport and industry. This is not as much a stretch as one might imagine; he actually knows football.\" Beane will retain his general manager duties with the Oakland A's, a team that remains competitive despite sporting one of the lowest payrolls in Major League Baseball (MLB). The A's have qualified for MLB's playoffs each of the past three seasons, only to be knocked out before the World Series every time. Critics of baseball's sabermetrics system -- using data to analyze the sport as exposed in Michael Lewis' \"Moneyball\" book which inspired the film -- are quick to point out that Beane has never won a title with the A's. In Holland, Beane won't need to start from scratch, as AZ currently sits comfortably in fourth place in the Dutch Eredivisie. AZ's director of football Earnie Stewart is a known \"Moneyball\" fan himself, having organized a screening for his fellow AZ execs shortly after joining the club. The former U.S. midfielder, who scored against Colombia in the 1994 World Cup, is half-Dutch and hopes the collaboration with Beane can give the club an extra edge. \"We've had a lot of contact with Billy In the last few months\", Stewart told the club's website. \"His knowledge and ideas are impressive. Also Billy's soccer network is excellent. We have already noticed that Billy thinks two steps ahead in the area of innovation. That's what really connects with the ambitions of AZ.\" Like the A's, AZ have managed to compete with the big boys of the Dutch league -- chiefly PSV and Ajax -- on a limited budget, winning the domestic league twice -- most recently in 2009 -- while finishing in the top five in three of the past five seasons. Beane's philosophy is shaped by getting maximum bang for your buck in the transfer market. \"There is a misconception that you never pay much for anybody, but that is not true at all,\" Beane told the Telegraph in 2011. \"You want to make sure you are getting more value than you are paying. That may come in the form of a very expensive player, it may come in the form of a very young player, but it's not about being cheap or not spending money.\" But it's questionable whether \"Moneyball\" principles can be applied to football, a sport where -- unlike in U.S. sports leagues -- players are rarely traded for one another. Instead, athletes are sold for prices determined by a marketplace, untethered by salary caps. However, Anderson argues Beane could be about to exploit a gap in the market. \"I would say unequivocally that markets for players are much more inefficient in soccer than in baseball,\" said Anderson, who also wrote \"The Numbers Game: Everything You Know About Football Is Wrong.\" \"The combination of a global market plus inefficiency means that is a huge opportunity in soccer that there isn't in the same way in baseball.\" Either way, Beane is likely to relish the challenge of imparting his knowledge to the boardrooms of European football, perhaps even as a pre-cursor to a full time job in the sport. \"I think he certainly would be open to the possibility of taking on a role,\" said Anderson, adding that Beane could be using the advisory position to dip his toe into the shark-infested waters of football player transfers. \"In football we're still in a pre-'Moneyball' era,\" added Anderson. \"So the baseball equivalent of the mid-1990s. is the football equivalent of 2015.\"","highlights":"Baseball's Billy Beane to join top-tier Dutch club as executive .\nSmaller clubs seeking advantage over big -pending giants ."}
{"article":"(CNN)\"Good night Malaysian three-seven-zero.\" It was a routine sign-off, an all-is-well. On March 8, 2014, at 1:19 a.m., someone spoke those last words from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 to air traffic controllers before the Boeing 777 vanished. A year later, searchers have no new clues as to where it went with 239 people on board. Radar and satellite reports have provided hints, but searchers still have nothing to hold in their hands. No wreckage seen floating at sea or beached on shore. No fuselage resting on the sea floor. Experts have said the data indicate the flight path from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing unexpectedly veered, putting the commercial jet over the southern Indian Ocean. But the water's vast and intricate depths have revealed no secrets. And as clarity has eluded grasp, analysts have made many speculations about what happened. The most controversial idea: Is the maritime search area all wrong? Did the plane land clandestinely on solid ground? Here are some expert theories about what happened to MH370. Investigators have since cast doubt on some of their details. Who radioed those last words to air traffic control? Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah? First officer Fariq Abdul Hamid? There was much speculation over that, but the Malaysian inspectors in April said it was Zaharie. The pilots were supposed to check in with new air traffic controllers in Vietnam, but never did. One theory is that one pilot may have incapacitated the other, then guided the plane to its end, taking the passengers down with him in a dramatic suicide. Mark Weiss, a retired American Airlines captain, has flown a Boeing 777. He believed shortly after the crash that there may have been a struggle. \"It was one of the pilots that maybe had a meltdown or did something nefarious to the airplane,\" he said. But Malaysia Airlines Chief Executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya has vehemently defended his employees, particularly the pilot. \"We do not suspect any one of our crew until there's such evidence. ... Captain Zaharie is a very capable man,\" he said. \"We have no reason to suspect (him).\" Weiss also thought there could have been another person -- a crew member or someone else -- in the cockpit who \"was bent on perhaps committing suicide or doing some destruction on the aircraft.\" Copilot Hamid, 27, reportedly once invited a woman and her friend into the cockpit on a 2011 flight between Thailand and Malaysia. \"That's an enormous breach of security,\" Weiss said. But investigators punched holes in the idea, saying there was no indication of a third party in the cockpit, CNN reported in April. The difference between hijacking and commandeering is nuanced. The former term is often used when the hijacker issues a demand such as being taken to a safe-haven country or receiving ransom to release passengers. When people commandeer a plane, they might keep the motives secret, said political analyst Peter Bergen. They may want to steer it themselves at a target, like the September 11, 2001, terrorists did. In 1994, a FedEx employee burst into the cockpit of FedEx Flight 705 with a hammer and spear gun. He wanted to crash the plane into the company's Memphis, Tennessee, headquarters. The crew thwarted that takeover. \"Commandeering would fit with the few facts that we do know, and (it's) certainly a theory that we haven't heard a lot of that isn't a conspiracy,\" Bergen said. Experts are divided on this theory, partly because no terrorists have claimed responsibility at a moment when they would have the world's attention -- unless potential terrorists were waiting for something. MH370 went to Kazakhstan. Outlandish conjecture or genius insight? The theory that Russian actors on board MH370 found a way to get the plane through the border territory of China, Pakistan and India to a Kazakh landing strip leased to Russia comes from science journalist and private pilot Jeff Wise. Fleets of ships and search aircraft are looking in the wrong direction, he says. The airliner went north, not south. Investigators may have misinterpreted a key component of the Inmarsat satellite data. \"This is not a normal investigation. They need to throw out the book,\" Wise has said. Another aviation analyst, David Soucie, also cast doubt after MH370 went missing on the most widely held belief that the plane hit the Indian Ocean. \"If it had crashed in the way that we think it did, which is to run out of fuel and hit the water and break up into pieces, there would be pieces somewhere,\" he said. But Michael Exner, an engineer with decades of experience in the mobile satellite communications industry, says the data \"accurately and unambiguously\" shows MH370 went down near the so-called 7th arc, a path along which the search has been focused. \"The current ATSB search strategy remains the best search strategy,\" he said. In a less sinister but equally lethal explanation, some experts theorized the plane mysteriously crashed somewhere because of mechanical malfunction. Perhaps the electronics died, or a fire broke out, preventing the pilots from communicating. Maybe they turned to look for a landing strip but couldn't steer the plane properly. Pilots had trouble embracing the thought. \"I've been running that in my brain now ever since this thing happened,\" said Jim Tilmon, an aviation expert and retired American Airlines pilot. \"One possibility would be a total electrical failure which is very, very hard to imagine because (the plane) has so many generators coming from different places,\" Tilmon said. If they fail, there are other backups. He has said he's never heard of anything like it happening before. For months after MH370 disappeared, Malaysian officials reported details of the search to next of kin and the public. Something would be spotted, hopes rose, and then it didn't pan out. Hopes were dashed; anguish returned. Sunday, a year to the day after the plane disappeared, the international independent investigation committee released an interim report on the disappearance of MH370. It found no indications of unusual behavior among the aircraft's pilots and cabin crew before it took off, and said that Zaharie had had no personal or financial problems that would cast suspicion on him. The interim report also revealed that the battery of the underwater locator beacon on the plane's flight data recorder had expired more than a year before its disappearance. The battery on the plane's other so-called black box, the cockpit voice recorder, had been replaced as scheduled, and remained within its expiry date, the report said. CNN's Pamela Boykoff and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","highlights":"Many experts believe the plane went down in the South Indian Ocean .\nThe most controversial theory: Russians hijacked the plane to Kazakhstan .\nElectrical failure is another theory ."}
{"article":"(CNN)The news was stunning to hear: A young woman, 18-year-old Michelle Carter, was charged with involuntary manslaughter for allegedly sending text messages urging her friend to commit suicide. How could a young person -- who was a close friend of the deceased, Conrad Roy, 18 -- allegedly do such a horrifying thing? And what are the legal ramifications of what a teen says online or in a text? But a lesser discussed point this tragic story raises is how quickly a teen can go from normal everyday life to facing severe, life-altering legal consequences. That is why Lisa Green, author of the informative new book \"On Your Case: A Compassionate (and Only Slightly Bossy) Legal Guide for Every Stage of a Woman's Life,\" believes every parent of a teen should have a criminal defense lawyer in mind and at the ready -- just in case. \"To me this is the unrecognized area that parents, particularly parents of teens, miss all the time,\" said Green during a recent interview at CNN's studios. \"So many of our friends have armies of tutors, extracurricular activities, all sorts of angles covered ... but when it comes to the law, there's this black hole.\" Mom arrested for leaving 9-year-old alone at park . Green, a journalist, lawyer and television legal analyst, says people often think of  the law as scary and intimidating and believe they don't need to worry about it because their kid is never going to get into legal trouble. Whether it's a case as serious as Carter's involuntary manslaughter charge, or a simple allegation of vandalism, parents need to be prepared, Green said. \"I cannot count the number of kids I know, good kids, who find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" said Green. \"I have now two young adults, and when they were going through their teenage years, it was a simple matter of a party that went wrong, a group of kids in the park when the police stop by and have some questions, bringing something to school they shouldn't have. \"And in each of those cases, a little bit of knowledge of the law, a little bit of knowledge of what their rights are, the right way to behave, would have saved parents a heck of a lot of grief.\" Green thinks parents should think about the issue in the same way they would track down a good orthopedist if their child breaks a bone, or the best tutor if their child is struggling before the SAT. Parents' house seized after son's drug bust . \"I am not saying that parents need to go out and get their own law degrees ... but just dipping your finger into the topic will help you understand what's available to you to help you parent better,\" she said. She gives some real-life examples especially in the social media age. For instance, what if a teen is asked by a school administrator to turn over his or her cell phone based on allegations the teen was sending inappropriate texts? What parents should know, Green said, is that a school can't open a cell phone for no reason at all. \"They need to have reasonable suspicion that something's wrong,\" said Green, who said parents would be wise to talk to their teens about what's appropriate and what's not when it comes to handling such requests from school officials. \"If you're asked, as a child, for a locker search, to open a phone, to open a laptop, if it's your property, pause and ask if you could call Mom and Dad,\" she said. \"We can act whether we're lawyers or not as that first line of defense.\" Green also says that parents of college-bound teens should spend a few minutes looking online at the school's code of conduct. \"They don't tell you about it during that fantastic tour with the kid walking backwards as your child is looking around to say, 'Who can I party with?' But it's a really important set of information because different schools have different levels of tolerance\" for activities such as drinking on campus, she said. And even before teens head off to college, parents should know about social host laws, where parents could be held criminally responsible or face civil damages if teens drink alcohol in their home and then go off and do something inappropriate or even tragic. Scary consequences for parents hosting underage drinking . More than 150 cities or counties and 24 states currently have such laws on their books, according to Mothers Against Drunk Driving. In some cases, parents can be held liable even if they didn't know the drinking was taking place. \"It doesn't have to be you with the shaker, like an episode of 'Mad Men,' serving up Manhattans to a group of grateful teens,\" said Green. \"If you've made it possible in your home, if you don't lock your liquor cabinet -- I never did -- and all of a sudden kids are drinking, that could be a problem as well.\" While Green is passionate about educating parents on why they need to think about the law, she stresses that bad behavior by teens still needs to be punished either legally or at home. \"I am not advocating that kids should be absolved of responsibility. If a kid does something wrong, if they broke the law, they ought to be punished appropriately by it. But we also live in a society where we have legal rights, and I want parents to know that they should be aware of what those are so they can help their child use better judgment.\" So if after reading this, you are moved to try to find a criminal defense lawyer, how on earth do you go about finding one? Green's advice is to ask friends and colleagues for referrals and also consult with your state bar association, since you would want someone in your state who has experience with criminal defense issues. Then she says you should call up and interview a few lawyers, asking them everything from how much their services would cost (that can vary), to who would handle the work, to what their philosophy is about the law and teens' rights. \"You may or may not end up being friends afterwards, but that's not as important as feeling secure that your lawyer is approaching the situation in a way that feels right for you.\" Do you think it's important for parents of teens to be aware of the law and their children's legal rights?

{"article":"(CNN)For Max, the passage of Indiana's new religious freedom law feels a lot like high school. Max is transgender. The 26-year-old was born a female but identifies as a man. That was a tough experience in Evansville: looking like a girl, everyone treating you like one, but not feeling at home in your skin. Classmates made fun of him. He withdrew. He and his parents fought. Now they don't talk. Making it to his mid-20s feels like a victory to him now, as does knowing that he has friends who support him, friends who are straight and gay and transgender. He had just gotten to a point of feeling accepted when the Indiana state legislature passed the Religious Freedom Act. \"This law makes me feel like I'm being bullied all over again,\" he said. \"If I go into a restaurant and the owner doesn't like me because I'm transgender, because their religion has told them that I'm bad, does that give them the right to refuse to serve me? Proponents of the law, including Gov. Mike Pence, say that's not what the law will do. He has said it's intended to prevent the government from forcing anyone to do something that opposes their religious beliefs. Some businesses and Indianans are behind him. Nationally influential Christian evangelist Franklin Graham, who lives in North Carolina, tweeted this week, \"Thank God for politicians like @GovPenceIN who are not afraid to take a stand regardless of political consequences.\" But there is a tidal wave of opposition throughout the state and across the country. Critics say the law is a thinly veiled mechanism to legally sanction discrimination. Protests have raged throughout the state and elsewhere. Some religious leaders oppose it. Civic groups, corporations and state governments, such as Washington state and Connecticut, are vowing not to to do business with Indiana. The Indiana Chamber of Commerce has blasted the law. So has the N.C.A.A. Its college basketball tournament is hosting the Final Four in Indianapolis this weekend. Some businesses in the state are reacting by placing signs in windows that read, \"We serve everyone.\" Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard, a vocal opponent of the law, demanded: \"Fix this law. ... Do so immediately.\" He and others contend that because Indiana, unlike other states, has no statewide law protecting gays and lesbians from discrimination, this religious freedom law is a license to discriminate. Hundreds of protesters joined Max in a demonstration on the streets of Evansville Monday. Some said they would consider leaving the state because the law makes them feel unwelcome. Lee Flowers, 27, organized a rally in Evansville to protest the law. He grew up in Indiana, but now he's afraid to go into businesses with his boyfriend. \"This is very personal,\" he said. \"It hurts me. It really does. This is shameful for Indiana. Is anyone infringing on someone's religion? No. This is about giving people the legal defense to refuse business to someone they don't like based on sexual orientation.\" Casey Samson of Samson Family Leather in Lebanon told CNN that he read the law, which runs four pages. He feels that the law merely protects his right to refuse to sell to a customer whose beliefs he thinks offend his Catholic faith. That doesn't include gay customers, he insists. \"We have no issues serving a same sex couple at all,\" he said. \"The law is strictly protecting people from the government to forcefully make them do something against their will.\" CNN asked him to give an example of what might offend him, and cause him to refuse to sell to someone. \"Anything that promotes hate or a derogatory statement that someone believes is OK,\" he answered. \"I don't want to take my personal time making a product that spews hate into the world.\" That's never happened in Samson Family Leather's 35-year history, he said, but it could and that's why he thinks the law is needed. The owner has shared his opinion with local media, and that has sparked a fierce backlash from many in the community, he said. \"We've been called homophobic and hypocrites,\" he said. \"We've also experienced a very large amount of support.\"Our phones have not stopped ringing from people all over the state and country. We've gotten e-mails saying 'I appreciate you standing up. Thank you for standing up for our rights.' \" Indiana pastor Mike Woods told CNN Monday that he supports the law, too. \"As someone who walks in my religious freedom all the time, I'm glad I have something to protect me,\" he said. \"I don't see the law as discriminatory. I just see it protecting people from any type of business or anyone trying to infringe on their religious rights.\" Woods blamed Pence's office for its \"inability to educate\" people about what the law says. There should have been public meetings about it, Woods said. The Indianapolis Star reported that the ceremony where Pence signed the bill into law on Thursday was \"deliberately low-key and private\" and closed to media. The governor's staff office, it said, refused to provide names of people who surrounded Pence as he signed. To Samson, the law doesn't explicitly use the word discrimination and that, to him, means it won't lead to discrimination. The law states that the government can't \"substantially burden a person's exercise of religion\" and that individuals who feel like their religious beliefs have been or could be \"substantially burdened\" can lean on this law to fend off lawsuits. An often used example: A florist who doesn't want to sell flowers to a gay couple or a baker who doesn't want to make their wedding cake. Those are arguably businesses that can choose which client to hire and which to reject, proponents of the law say. CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said it's likely that a refusal to serve a gay person wouldn't stand under the law, but a refusal to provide a service for a gay wedding would. \"Indiana isn't the first state to establish this law,\" Samson said. \"It's nothing new for the U.S. and the state of Indiana.\" Samson is right that Indiana isn't the first state to adopt a religious freedom law, but the situation is a little more complicated than that. Indiana is the 20th state to adopt a \"religious freedom restoration\" law. For instance, bills in Arizona, Georgia and Ohio with similar wording were proposed. The effort in Arizona failed in 2014. Georgia's bill has not been voted on and the legislative session ends Thursday. The Ohio bill stalled in 2014. A similar bill is proposed in Arkansas. In Little Rock Monday night, protesters demonstrated against a bill called the Conscious Protection Act. As the bill's creator, Republican Rep. Bob Ballinger left a meeting Monday, protesters shouted: \"Shame on you!\" In the past, religious freedom laws were enacted with broad support. Many were passed before the recent movement for gay rights and before the majority of states came to recognize same-sex marriage. But when it was introduced in December, the bill that became Indian's religious freedom law incited fierce debate among faith leaders, businesses and residents, the Indianapolis Star newspaper reports. Mark Ivy watched as that debate raged over the holidays and into the new year, hoping that the bill would not pass. He lives in Farmersburg, Indiana, where about 1,100 people live. Indiana recognized gay marriage last October. Ivy married his longtime partner in December. \"I understand politics in Indiana. I know it's conservative. I get that this is about politics,\" he said. \"Because I can see it as politics, I'm not mad.\" But he also said that he feels the law is \"about bigotry, plain and simple.\" \"It's taking us back decades, removing so much progress toward equality in Indiana,\" he said. Ivy worries that the law could not only allow discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. He wonders if it \"could conceivably be used for Jewish businesses to  refuse service to Muslims and Christians. Hindus could bar Bhuddists.  Protestants and Catholics could shun each other,\" Ivy wrote in a CNN iReport. \"Mainline church members  could say, 'No' to evangelicals.\" On social media, debate over the law showed no signs of letting up. In response to Christian leader Graham's tweet supporting the law, someone with the username Mary M tweeted, \"amen using his God given right.\" Jennifer Watson tweeted them back: \"NO: as an elected official, his rights are not God given, they are voter given.\" CNN's Rosa Flores, Justin Lear, Sonia Moghe, Jeremy Diamond and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","highlights":"Transgender 20-something says Indiana's new feels like legalized discrimination .\nBusiness owner says the law protects his Catholic beliefs ."}
{"article":"Eight competitive rounds to the Masters and Rory McIlroy is determined to get back on track after the rude awakening of a rare missed cut at the Honda Classic last week. \u2018Sometimes a kick up the backside can do you a world of good, and I want to do well in these next two events,\u2019 said the world No 1, who will tee off alongside world No 2 Bubba Watson and No 3 Henrik Stenson in the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral on Thursday. The 25-year-old took advantage of some unexpected time off to take his mum Rosie out for a birthday treat last Friday night before getting down to some serious hard practice over the weekend. Rory McIlroy was back in action during a practice round ahead of the\u00a0WGC-Cadillac Championship . World No 1 has this event and the\u00a0Arnold Palmer Invitational to hone his game for the Masters . McIlroy only has The Masters left to complete a full set of golf's grand slam titles . \u2018I guess coming off a three-week break you\u2019re never quite sure how your game is going to be, and I just wasn\u2019t comfortable playing the shots I needed to play in the wind,\u2019 said McIlroy. \u2018Now I\u2019m excited to get back at it and obviously put in a better performance. I\u2019ve worked on those wind shots and I feel in a better place and probably a little more prepared than I was last week.\u2019 On Monday, McIlroy turned up at the renowned Seminole club in south Florida for their fabled member-guest event. He walked through the locker room and studied the names on the winner\u2019s board. Men with names like Snead and Hogan. Nicklaus, Palmer and Woods. \u2018It would be cool to have my name up there,\u2019 he thought to himself and well, you can probably guess what happened next. The four-time major champion breezed round in 63 and won by two strokes. The Norther Irishman gets lost among the azaleas while playing the Masters last season . McIlroy got a 'kick up the backside' by missing the cut at the Honda Classic in Florida . Now it is the first World Golf Championship event of the season featuring every single member of the world\u2019s top 50. \u2018I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s important for me to be going to the Masters at the top of my form,\u2019 said McIlroy. \u2018I\u2019ve won majors when not playing well leading up to them. But I know one thing for sure. I\u2019d much rather be going there with a win or a good performance under my belt.\u2019 When he has finished here, McIlroy will head up to Augusta with his dad Gerry before playing his final competitive event ahead of his first tilt at a career grand slam. That event will be at the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill. McIlroy was not the only one to leave West Palm Beach last week determined to make amends here. How about Ian Poulter, who bossed a good field in terms of shotmaking but squandered a golden opportunity to claim his first strokeplay triumph on American soil? Ryder Cup hero Ian Poulter announces he will be hosting the British Masters in October . The British Masters will be staged at\u00a0Woburn Golf Club in association with Sky Sports . Poulter put no fewer than five balls into the water during his final round to miss out on the sudden death play-off by a stroke. Now he finds himself on a course laden with so many water hazards it is known as the Blue Monster. Any prospect of a watery hangover, therefore? The ever-confident one gave short shrift to the notion. \u2018Do you think I will have suddenly developed a phobia for water?\u2019 he asked, aghast. \u2018Come on. I\u2019m holding a bottle of water for heaven\u2019s sake! \u2018Honestly, I couldn\u2019t care less there\u2019s water everywhere. This is a course where you\u2019ve got to hit your targets and yes, if you miss them and hit bad shots then chances are that your ball is going to finish up wet. \u2018But I\u2019m going into this tournament having led the field last week in greens in regulation and shots that finished closest to the hole. \u2018Yes, it\u2019s a tournament I should have won and I\u2019m devastated in some ways that I didn\u2019t. But I haven\u2019t spent the time since wallowing on the sofa or worrying about the three or four loose shots that cost me. Poulter found the water no less than five times as he missed out on a play off at the Honda Classic . Poulter insists he has put the slump behind him and is fitter than ever heading into the WGC at Doral . \u2018Time to move on and enjoy the fact I\u2019m fitter than I\u2019ve been for some time. I did some tests last week and the strength in my shoulder area is 75 per cent greater than last year, when I was struggling with injuries. No, it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to hit the ball 75 per cent further but it does mean I\u2019m going to be able to cope better with the rigours of a long season and be able to hit the number of practice balls on the range that I want to.\u2019 Poulter was speaking at the official announcement that he will be the host when the British Masters, with Sky Sports as presenting sponsor, is relaunched in October. If that welcome development sounds familiar, it is because Sportsmail broke the news last November. As we revealed back then, Poulter will be followed in future years as host by Justin Rose, Lee Westwood and Luke Donald.","highlights":"Rory McIlroy missed the cut at the Honda Classic, Florida last week .\nWorld No 1 is back playing at the\u00a0WGC-Cadillac Championship in Doral .\nMcIlroy has two events left before the start of The Masters at Augusta .\nIan Poulter announced he would be hosting British Masters in October ."}
{"article":"Dennis Irwin has hailed Daley Blind's versatility and backed him to retain a place in the Manchester United starting XI, even when injured players return. The former United left-back, who made 529 appearances for the club between 1990 and 2002, was impressed by Blind when he played in that position during Sunday's 3-0 win over Tottenham. It was United's best performance of the season, keeping them anchored in the Premier League top four and boosting confidence ahead of this weekend's crunch trip to Anfield to play Liverpool. Daley Blind (right) was impressive for Manchester United in Sunday's 3-0 win over Tottenham . Irwin, seen here celebrating a goal with David Beckham in 1997, believes Blind deserves his place in the team . Sunday's clash between Manchester United and Liverpool will be pivotal in the top four race . 'Daley's a good, honest pro,' Irwin told ManUtd.com. 'He can play at centre-half if you need him, left-back if you need him, and obviously he's played mostly in midfield for us this season. I think he's been a really good signing. 'He's a player who reads situations very, very well, I thought he played extremely well on Sunday. It'll be interesting to see the team the manager picks against Liverpool, but it wouldn't surprise me if he picks the same 11 players, because they played so well. 'That's the manager's decision and he's got one or two back from suspension and injury, but I thought the team played very well on Sunday.' Blind sets off in pursuit of Arsenal's Francis Coquelin during last week's FA Cup sixth round tie . Blind celebrates scoring a late equaliser for United at West Ham last month . The Dutch international also scored a crucial late goal at West Brom earlier in the campaign . Dutch international Blind, who arrived at Old Trafford from Ajax for \u00a313.8m last summer, has at times struggled for form this season but is showing signs of adapting to the English game. Irwin added: 'I know Blind can fill in places and he's done tremendously well for us in midfield. 'He hasn't played at left-back that many times, he's not played centre-half in a three that many times for us but we know he can play there. 'I thought Phil Jones and Chris Smalling were aggressive, didn't give Harry Kane much room, and Antonio Valencia played really well at right-back, so it was good to see and we'll need plenty of that at Anfield.'","highlights":"Man United travel to Liverpool on Sunday in crunch top four clash .\nDenis Irwin believes Blind should keep his place in the side .\nDutch international played well at left-back in 3-0 win over Spurs .\nBlind can fill a number of positions across the defence and midfield .\nLiverpool vs Man Utd XIs: Steven Gerrard fails to make Jamie Carragher's team as Gary Neville picks Angel di Maria .\nREAD:\u00a0Liverpool are the in form side, but  United will hope to open up a gap ."}
{"article":"Paul Scholes believes Manchester United must spend big again this summer if Louis van Gaal's tactics are to bring success to Old Trafford. United were dumped out of the FA Cup by Arsenal on Monday and face a battle to finish in the top four with a difficult run of fixtures over the next six weeks. And former United midfielder Scholes, who has two season tickets at his old club, is unconvinced that Van Gaal's preferred style of play suits the players in his squad. Louis van Gaal gives instructions to Ashley Young during Manchester United's defeat by Arsenal . Marouane Fellaini, Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney (L-R) look dejected at Old Trafford . Arsene Wenger was right! I would have loved to have played with Mesut Ozil... but only if he always performed like he did at Old Trafford . Writing in his column for\u00a0The Independent, Scholes said: 'Watching United at Old Trafford on Monday, I know what Louis van Gaal is trying to do with this team. I do like the concept. I just question whether he has the players to do it. 'In recent weeks, Van Gaal has tried what I would describe as a more Barcelona-style approach to games. His centre backs push wide, the full backs push on and the team pass the ball. It has worked against the weaker teams but it is against the stronger sides, starting with Spurs and the high-pressing game they play, that you have to wonder whether it will be found out. 'To play this way, you really need to be exceptional. Barcelona can do it because they have the players and they have been playing this way for years. United have spent around \u00a3220m in the last three transfer windows and yet I would question whether they have the players to operate this system.' Van Gaal has been criticised for utilising Fellaini's height and physical presence at times this season . Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes believes the club must buy more new players this summer . United were known for their relentless attacking under Sir Alex Ferguson and Scholes, who was an integral part of the Scot's midfield, wants to see fluid football back at Old Trafford. 'I understand what Van Gaal is trying to do,' Scholes wrote. 'I like that he is playing with the wide players. I also know that as former players we cannot harp on about the old days for ever. Things change, although I believe that certain principles, of attacking, entertaining football, should always be protected. 'Like any other match-going fan \u2013 I have two season tickets for Old Trafford \u2013 I want to see the team play well and win. I just don\u2019t think this system is the best for these players.' Angel di Maria has struggled to adapt since joining the club in a \u00a360million deal from Real Madrid . Former Chelsea midfielder Juan Mata has found himself out of favour under Van Gaal in recent months . Van Gaal's men are fourth in the Premier League table ahead of Sunday's clash with Tottenham but they could drop out of the Champions League places if they suffer defeat and rivals Liverpool win at Swansea on Monday night. Despite the club's precarious position, Scholes is adamant that the Dutchman has what it takes to turn things around - even if he must take action in the summer transfer window. He added: 'I still believe that Van Gaal is the right man for the job. I don\u2019t think he will change his mind about the way he wants the team to play. He is a stubborn man and that is no bad thing in football. But I am afraid to say that if he wants to play this Barcelona style then the club will have to go back into the transfer market this summer to get the players they need to do it.'","highlights":"Paul Scholes believes Louis van Gaal is trying to play a 'Barcelona style'\nHe feels Manchester United do not have the right players to make it work .\nScholes wants Van Gaal to spend big to improve his squad this summer .\nSeason ticket-holder Scholes also wants United to attack and entertain .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Manchester United news ."}

As part of CNN's Instant Startups series, CNNMoney correspondent Laurie Segall reached out to Meerkat's Ben Rubin with some questions. And he agreed to answer them -- on Meerkat, of course. You can see a few moments from the chat in the video above. Rubin is actually the co-founder and chief executive of Life On Air Inc., a livestreaming company with many tentacles. But recently Rubin decided to dedicate his entire team to work on Meerkat after the app's popularity exploded. Still, Rubin said, he doesn't consider the app an \"instant startup\" per se. It took years of work to reach this moment, he said. The half-hour chat between Rubin and Segall was informative and entertaining. Several people said it broke their record for the longest Meerkat stream they had ever watched. We heard more about Meerkat and Rubin's vision for the future; for example, he sees the app branching out to work with other platforms, like Facebook or Tumblr. Rubin also revealed who he'd like most to join in the fun. Startup wannabes also got some great advice from this successful entrepreneur. Launching a new business or product is difficult, and requires flexibility, Rubin said. Entrepreneurs need people they can trust -- who won't be afraid to call \"b.s.\" on a bad idea.

{"article":"(CNN)Pakistan's highest court Friday ordered the release of Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, the alleged mastermind behind the Mumbai attacks, calling his detention illegal. Lakhvi, a top leader of the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, was not present at Friday's court proceeding. The terror attacks in India left more than 160 people dead in November 2008. In the attacks, heavily armed men stormed landmark buildings around Mumbai, including luxury hotels, the city's historic Victoria Terminus train station and a Jewish cultural center. On Friday, India summoned the Pakistan high commissioner \"to convey our strong feelings about (the) Lakhvi verdict,\" said India's external affairs spokesman Syed Akbaruddin. Last year, the court granted Lakhvi bail, a decision the Pakistani government had said it would challenge. Many in India are still angry over the attacks and had criticized the bail decision. \"It is very disappointing that the accused of the Mumbai attacks has been granted bail,\" the nation's home minister, Rajnath Singh, said in December. India executed the last surviving gunman from the attacks in 2012. Other suspects were all killed during the series of attacks, which went on for three days.

{"article":"Los Angeles (CNN)The search for a rookie Los Angeles Police Department officer suspected of homicide has expanded into an international manhunt, focused on the border cities of El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. The FBI said Friday it believes AWOL policeman Henry Solis is armed and dangerous and drove 800 miles across the desert from Southern California to El Paso with his father in a pickup a week ago. The FBI is offering $25,000 for information leading directly to the arrest of Solis in connection with the death of Salome Rodriguez, 23, who died after a fight between the men in a downtown Pomona, California, bar. \"The pattern suggests he crossed into Mexico, but he has family and friends living in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez,\" said Scott Garriola, special FBI agent who runs the fugitive task force from the Los Angeles Bureau. \"So he could be on either side of the border.\" \"It's a quick bus ride from the interior of Mexico to other parts of the country and Central America.\" The FBI, Pomona Police and Los Angeles County District Attorney declined to comment on whether Victor Solis might face charges for allegedly helping his son flee to El Paso. Garriola said Solis is a veteran of the Marines and \"he has extensive training and weapons\" understanding. Authorities posted three photos of Solis, with and without facial hair, and said he may now have a full beard. Police said after the early morning bar fight Solis pursued his victim on foot in the nightclub district and shot him multiple times. Garriola said Solis then reportedly called his father in Lancaster, California, and later that morning they began the trek to El Paso. Victor Solis said he dropped off his son at a bus stop in El Paso and his son made some incriminating statements \"not only about his actions that day but also that he would never be seen again,\" Garriola said. Henry Solis worked in the Devonshire Division of the San Fernando Valley, where he rode with a training officer. Earlier this week, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck fired Solis and appealed for him to give up. \"You have dishonored this police department, your country and your service to your country,\" Beck said. Marine Corps records say Solis served in Iraq from April to November 2007, earning several medals, including for the Iraq campaign, global war on terrorism service and Marine Corps good conduct. The personnel file also shows Solis was an aircraft maintenance technician and a security guard. Garriola said he was confident Solis will be caught, and said he shared Beck's opinion of Solis. \"It's a brother law enforcement officer, he served our country, we echo that same indignation.\"","highlights":"FBI says it believes AWOL rookie policeman Henry Solis is armed and dangerous .\nHe is accused of shooting a man after a fight in a Pomona, California, bar ."}
{"article":"Scotland centre Alex Dunbar could miss the Rugby World Cup \u2013 after collapsing with suspected ligament damage to his left knee in training on Thursday. Dunbar had been named in the XV to face England in Saturday's Calcutta Cup clash at Twickenham. But, running on his own just an hour before selection was announced this morning, he changed direction and his knee simply gave way. The damage is being scanned at a private hospital in Edinburgh, while a specialist will need to examine the images before making a final diagnosis. Alex Dunbar faces a race against time to be fit for the Rugby World Cup after injuring his knee at training . While Scotland coaching staff are hopeful that he may only have torn his cartilage, putting him out of action for around six weeks, there is a real fear that Dunbar has sustained damage to his ACL \u2013 which means up to six months on the sidelines. Matt Scott, who had been due to start on the bench, will take Dunbar's place in the starting line-up on Saturday. Scotland centre Dunbar was due to start against England in the Calcutta Cup on Saturday . David Denton, Jim Hamilton and Dougie Fife will all start for Scotland against England on Saturday after Vern Cotter made five changes to his starting XV. Stand-off Finn Russell also returns to the Dark Blues line-up for the penultimate RBS 6 Nations clash at Twickenham after suspension ruled him out of the 22-19 defeat to Italy at Murrayfield two weeks ago. The Scots are desperate to restore pride in the Calcutta Cup meeting following three straight defeats to France, Wales and the Azzurri. Edinburgh number eight Denton - the only player among the incoming five not to have featured in this year's competition - replaces Johnnie Beattie after shaking off the calf strain which has kept him out of action so far. Denton's Gunners team-mates Fife - a try-scorer against France in round one - and Matt Scott replace injured wing Sean Lamont and centre Alex Dunbar, who are both ruled out with knee complaints. Russell, meanwhile, starts in place of Peter Horne while experienced Saracens lock Hamilton takes the place of benched forward Tim Swinson. Cotter said: 'Jim comes in and will bring his physicality and understanding of English rugby to our forward pack. 'It's good to have Dave Denton back as he provides us with strong ball-carrying and strong defence. He's also a very good lineout forward and will give us a bit more physical density against a big forward pack. 'It's been tough on Finn to sit out and it's great to have him back. He's slotted straight back in to the structure we're looking for. 'Finally, Dougie came on and played well against France and has had a couple of games with his club. 'We're looking for him to bring his enthusiasm, energy and high work-rate, particularly in kick-chase and receipt.' Tighthead prop Euan Murray, meanwhile, will equal Allan Jacobsen's all-time appearance record for a Scotland prop when he collects his 65th cap. Dunbar, here showing his disappointment after Scotland's loss to Wales, awaits results of scans on his knee . He will partner Alasdair Dickinson and fit-again Ross Ford, who has recovered from the back spasm suffered against Italy to start in an experienced front-row. Jonny Gray remains in the second-row to pack down with Hamilton, while Blair Cowan and Rob Harley start together for the sixth consecutive time in the back-row, alongside Denton. Captain Greig Laidlaw will again partner the returning Russell from scrum-half, with the back-line completed by Glasgow Warriors trio Mark Bennett, Tommy Seymour and Stuart Hogg. Hogg, Fife, Bennett, Scott, Seymour, Russell, Laidlaw. Dickinson, Ford, Murray, Hamilton, Gray, Harley, Cowan and Denton . Subs: Brown, Grant, Cross, Swinson, Beattie, Ashe, Hidalgo-Clyne, Tonks . Cotter added: 'This is a very important game. 'It will be played away from home at a very intense level and will allow us to assess further our ability to operate away from home in a hostile environment. 'Our focus, however, has been on ourselves and how we can perform better, by identifying the areas that we can control - like improving our skill sets and reinforcing our cohesion - to withstand the difficult times and also apply some pressure.'","highlights":"Alex Dunbar was running on his own when his knee gave way on Thursday .\nThe injury puts the Scotland centre in doubt for the 2015 Rugby World Cup .\nScotland face England in the Six Nations for the Calcutta Cup on Saturday ."}
{"article":"London (CNN)British Prime Minister David Cameron formally asked Queen Elizabeth II to dissolve his country's Parliament on Monday, opening the way for campaigning ahead of the May 7 general election. The procedural step means there are officially no members of Parliament until it reconvenes on May 18 for the swearing-in of members and the official state opening of Parliament on May 27. Addressing media outside the official prime ministerial residence at 10 Downing St., Cameron said that Britain had been \"on the brink\" when he came into office. \"Of course, we haven't fixed everything, but Britain is back on her feet again.\" Cameron said the nation faced \"a stark choice\" in 38 days. \"The next Prime Minister walking through that door will be me or (Labour Party leader) Ed Miliband,\" he said. \"You can choose an economy that grows, that creates jobs, that generates the money to ensure a properly funded and improving NHS (National Health Service) ... and a government that will cut taxes for 30 million hard-working people ... or you can choose the economic chaos of Ed Miliband's Britain,\" Cameron said. \"After five years of effort and sacrifice, Britain is on the right track. This election is about moving forward -- and as Prime Minister here at No. 10 that's what I will deliver.\" Miliband launched Labour's Business Manifesto on Monday, saying that a second Conservative term would threaten Britain's EU membership and pose \"a clear and present danger\" to British firms and prosperity. \"There are two futures on offer at this election,\" Miliband said. \"To carry on with a Conservative plan based on the idea that as long as the richest and most powerful succeed, everyone else will be OK. Or a Labour plan, a better plan, that says it is only when working people succeed that Britain succeeds.\" Miliband also referenced Cameron's March 23 announcement that the Conservative leader had ruled out standing for a third term -- before the election that will decide whether he even gets a second term in the top job -- saying the Conservative candidates would be \"vying against each other for who can be the most extreme on Europe.\" Cameron and his Conservative Party won the last election in 2010, but not by enough to go into government alone. Without a majority in Parliament, a government becomes dependent on MPs, or lawmakers, from other parties to get its program voted through the House of Commons, the chamber that passes laws and legislation. For five years, Cameron has been governing in coalition with the UK's third party, the Liberal Democrats. Nick Clegg, Liberal Democrat leader and deputy prime minister, has mostly backed Cameron in parliamentary debates against Labour's Miliband. \"For the first time ever, the Liberal Democrats go into this campaign with a record of action in government to be extremely proud of,\" Clegg said Monday. \"We have kept the government in the center ground and shown that we are the only party that can build a stronger economy and a fairer society.\" The right-wing UK Independence Party, or UKIP, which has pledged to take the UK out of the European Union, has made massive gains in the past year -- mostly at the expense of Cameron's Conservatives. Last year, in a backlash against the EU, UKIP caused a political earthquake and won elections to the European Parliament in Britain, and some commentators have likened its impact on UK politics to that of the tea party in the United States. It is unclear how UKIP will perform in the May 7 UK general election. Some of its supporters appeared to be casting protest votes last year and could return to the established Conservative and Labour parties when more is at stake. On Monday, UKIP leader Nigel Farage tweeted: \"UKIP is the party of real change for real people. If you #VoteUKIP on May 7th, you'll get MPs willing to hold the government to account.\" Meanwhile, in Scotland, the September independence referendum (which narrowly failed) so reinvigorated the Scottish National Party that it could hit what is usually a key Labour stronghold, undermining Miliband's bid for power. Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond quit after the referendum, and Nicola Sturgeon now heads the party. \"The general election on May 7 is a fantastic opportunity for Scotland to make Westminster sit up and take notice,\" Sturgeon said Monday. \"By holding the balance of power in a hung Parliament, SNP MPs can work with others to lock David Cameron out of Downing Street -- and ensure that Scotland's priorities become priorities at Westminster,\" she said. Eligible Britons must be registered by April 20 to vote.","highlights":"British Prime Minister David Cameron formally asks Queen to dissolve Parliament .\nMove paves way for official campaigning ahead of May 7 general elections ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Southerners, don't pack your sweaters or heavy coats away just yet. You're probably going to need them for a few days. A cold front is headed across the country. Enjoy the warmth until it gets where you are, because after that temperatures are going to drop 20 degrees or more before you know it. And it's not just the South that will have to put up with the cold. Almost a third of the people in the United States are bundling up and looking up to the sky. Another widespread winter event was shaping up Wednesday afternoon, and it looks as if it will last through Thursday. About 92 million people are under some sort of winter weather warning, watch or advisory.  The wintery weather will eventually extend nearly 2,000 miles, from New Mexico to Massachusetts. For once, Boston won't be worried about a being a segment leader in snow totals. Looks likes that will be Kentucky, where some spots could see 6 to 10 inches. Other areas will have to worry about heavy rain dumped by the slow moving front. Cities in southeast Missouri, western Kentucky, northern Tennessee and western Pennsylvania might get 2 to 4 inches. Rain will transition to snowfall across many states as colder air pushes in behind the front as it moves to the southeast. The National Weather Service warned that flooding could be an issue, especially across the lower Ohio Valley and western Mid-Atlantic regions. CNN affiliate WCHS reported a mudslide in Mingo County resulted in one woman going to the hospital. There are concerns about ice and the potential for power outages. Arkansas, northern Mississippi and western Tennessee will get the brunt of the icy weather. Some areas could see more than a third of an inch of ice accumulation. Sleet and ice are expected to make things messy in the Dallas area. The precipitation was causing problems at Dallas\/Fort Worth International Airport, where more than 630 arrivals and departures were canceled or delayed. Nationwide, more than 3,800 flights were delayed, according to the air traffic tracking website FlightAware. At least 1,750 were canceled. Things will be worse Thursday, at least as cancellations go. More than 2,000 flights with U.S. ties have been scrubbed. So far this season Boston has seen 105.7 inches -- almost 9 feet -- of snow. That's just 1.9 inches short of the record set nine years ago. More snow is expected from this system, but it's only likely to be 1 inch Wednesday as the forecast models indicate the majority of snow will stay south of the city. There is a slim chance of snow on Thursday, followed by days of sunshine and temperatures near 40 by Monday. CNN meteorologists Dave Hennen and Matt Daniel contributed to this report.","highlights":"More than 5,000 flights with U.S. ties canceled or delayed .\nPeople in Louisville and other cities in Kentucky will have plenty of snowman-building material .\nBoston is close to a season snow record, but it's iffy this system will provide enough to top the mark ."}

Today is has nearly 250 automobiles. \"When I was modeling, the best part of my modeling career was (that) I was expressing what my client wanted me to do,\" he says. \"I still express what (clients) want me to express, but this time in a three-dimensional form with an engine and an exhaust and some wheels. And that is ultimate satisfaction.\" During his fashion model days, Elo owned seven cars and would drive a different one each day of the week. What started as a passion gradually demanded more and more of his time, and after a while Elo felt that he came to a crossroads. \"I had to weigh between continuing modeling or stopping modeling to just do cars. So I chose the latter,\" he says. \"My friends told me 'You're absolutely crazy, look at all these beautiful women, look at all this traveling around the world.' And I'm like 'Are you out of your mind? Look at that beautiful steel!'

{"article":"(CNN)Iraqi forces say they've captured key areas in their offensive to take back Tikrit, which has been under ISIS control since June. The security forces, backed by Shia militias, raised the Iraqi flag over the governorate and the main hospital buildings in the city Monday night, a security official with the forces in Tikrit told CNN. The gains, according to the official, came after a slow advance into the city as the forces dealt with more than 300 improvised explosive devices planted in the city's streets. At least 26 militants were killed in the operation, the official said. Earlier Monday, Iraqi federal police said in a statement aired on Iraqi television that the forces had liberated four neighborhoods in southern Tikrit. The renewed push into Tikrit comes days after a series of U.S.-led airstrikes aimed at ISIS targets around the city. The goal of those airstrikes was to pave the way for Iraqi forces to go in. Now security forces and fighters from Hashd Al-Shaabi, a predominantly Shia paramilitary force that has doing much of the fighting in the critical battle to take Tikrit back from ISIS, say they're gaining ground. Iraqi forces have tried multiple times to win back Tikrit since ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, conquered the city in June as part of its campaign to amass an expansive Islamic caliphate. And each time, so far, they've failed. The latest push began after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on March 1 ordered Iraqi forces to retake Tikrit and Salahuddin province. Militants have been under pressure ever since in the battleground city, which is the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and  located about 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of Baghdad. ISIS responded by adjusting its positions in and around the city, hiding in buildings and other key infrastructure, said Saad al-Hadithi, a spokesman for al-Abadi. This movement led Iraq's military to pause its operation, out of growing worries that a full-on invasion could produce heavy Iraqi military and some civilian casualties. The situation spurred the Iraqi Prime Minister to request help from the U.S.-led coalition, which conducted airstrikes around Tikrit last week. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, Catherine E. Shoichet,  Ashley Fantz, Ben Wedeman and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","highlights":"A push to retake Tikrit stalled as ISIS repositioned its forces around the city .\nSpokesman: Iraq's leader requested help because coalition has \"advanced\" capabilities .\nLeaders of predominantly Shiite militia fighting in area had resisted such intervention ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Two U.K. charities have stopped funding a Muslim advocacy group that had earlier helped ISIS's masked murderer \"Jihadi John,\" now identified as Mohammed Emwazi, before his radicalization, the group said. The human rights and advocacy group CAGE in London said it accepted the loss of funding from the Roddick Foundation and the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust. But CAGE blamed a \"neo-conservative\" leadership on the U.K.'s Charity Commission for pressuring the two charities to halt funding. \"We respect their decision. We thank them for their past support. Both of these charities have played a significant role in contributing to the development of Muslim civil society here in the UK,\" CAGE spokesperson Amandla Thomas-Johnson said Friday. The termination of funding came after the Charity Commission \"took robust action\" and cited how \"public statements by CAGE officials heightened concerns about the use of charitable funds to support their activities,\" the commission said in a statement. The commission didn't specify those statements by CAGE, but stated that \"in our view, those statements increased the threat to public trust and confidence in charity and raised clear questions for a charity considering funding CAGE's activities as to how the trustees of those charities could comply with their legal duties as charity trustees,\" the commission said. \"CAGE is not a charity but has been in part funded by British charities. As it is not a charity and given the nature of its work, and the controversy it has attracted, the Charity Commission has been concerned that such funding risked damaging public trust and confidence in charity,\" the commission said. \"As the regulator of charities, we expect all charities and trustees to ensure that all charitable funds are used according to their charity's purposes and in the way that the public would expect,\" the commission said. CAGE said it had worked with Emwazi and indicated that British authorities' tactics pushed him to radicalize. CAGE said that emails he sent the organization paint a picture of a desperate man hounded by authorities who saw his plans for a new life crumble as he tried unsuccessfully to get help. Emwazi felt he was being harassed by authorities and tried to seek legal help to stop it, according to CAGE. Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born Londoner, was a \"polite\" and \"beautiful young man\" who would drop into the CAGE office with treats to thank the group for helping him, the group said. Emwazi came to CAGE in 2009 looking for support when he felt that British authorities were -- in the words of Asim Qureshi, CAGE's research director -- \"harassing\" him. But Emwazi has now been identified by U.S. officials as the masked man in ISIS videos showing beheadings of Western hostages. More than a dozen British administrative court documents obtained by CNN reveal British security services initially believed Emwazi was part of a radical West London recruitment network for terrorist groups in East Africa. The two charities gave sizeable funds to CAGE. The Rowntree Charitable Trust has given 271,250 British pounds, or almost $408,000, to CAGE since 2007, the commission said. The trust had pledged a total of 305,000 pounds, or almost $459,000, the commission said. The Roddick Foundation gave CAGE of 120,000 pounds, or more than $180,000 between 2009 and 2012, the commission said. In acknowledging the funding losses, CAGE criticized the commission. \"This is just another manifestation of their objective of pursuing a Cold War on British Islam,\" Thomas-Johnson said. \"CAGE will remain committed to its principle of speaking truth to power and calling for accountability and transparency. We will not hesitate in performing our role as whistleblowers and as advocates for due process.\" Supporters of CAGE tweeted their criticism of the Charity Commission and the two philanthropies' decision to terminate funding. One supporter remarked that \"if @UK_CAGE is not there to provide us with a counter-narrative when it comes to 'radicalization'.... who will?!\" The commission said it will soon conclude its \"open cases\" into the two charities and publish a report and lessons \" for other charities which fund non-charitable bodies.\"","highlights":"UK Charity Commission takes \"robust action\" against Muslim advocacy group CAGE .\nTwo charities under commission's regulation no longer fund CAGE .\nCommission cites unspecified public remarks made by CASE ."}
{"article":"London (CNN)A British mother is standing by her decision to let her son, 11, wear a \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" costume to his school's World Book Day celebration. \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" tells the tale of a naive college graduate's energetic trysts with a billionaire -- Christian Grey -- who has a penchant for bondage. The Manchester Evening News reported that Liam Scholes arrived at Sale High School in northwest England dressed as Grey, complete with cable ties and an eyemask on Thursday. The school contacted Liam's mother and told her the costume was inappropriate. Nicola Scholes told the newspaper she and her son had thought the idea was funny. \"We were walking home from school and he had the idea of going as Christian Grey,\" she said. \"At first we laughed it off but then we discussed it with a few friends and saw the funny side and decided it was quite a good costume idea.\" The school called her to say the costume was not appropriate and that Liam would not take part in the book day event or appear in any photographs, Scholes told the paper. A teacher from the school had dressed as the fictional serial killer Dexter, Scholes said: \"I don't see why sex is more offensive than murder.\" Scholes told BBC News that her son had not read the book or watched the movie spin-off but had been aware of the media around the tale. \"He understood what the cable ties were supposed to represent, as did other children of his age.\" Scholes told the BBC the costume was light-hearted:  \"It was a laugh, it was tongue in cheek and there was no offense.\" On Friday Scholes tweeted an image of Liam with the caption: \"Liam's offensive book day costume, it was that inappropriate that they told him to change his character and wouldn't include him on any photos. It also required a phone call home regarding the matter. \"Yet it was appropriate for a teacher to dress up as a serial killer and other students to come in with 'guns.'

{"article":"(CNN)When one man sat down next to a second man in a St. Louis light rail car and asked him his opinion on the shooting of Michael Brown, it was not the beginning of a discussion. It was the start of an assault, police said. The second man, who was white, didn't want to answer the question. Then the first man, who was black, boxed him in the face. Two more African-American men joined in the beating, according to a police report about Monday's incident. It was caught on surveillance cameras on the MetroLink train and a passenger recorded it with a cell phone and posted the video online. It has gone viral. Police confirmed to CNN that the online images came from the attack. The victim, 43, was commuting home when a young man in a red T-shirt and cap walked up to him. The victim asked not to be named in media reports. The man asked to use the victim's cell phone. He declined, and the young man sat down beside him. \"Then he asked me my opinion on the Michael Brown thing,\" the victim told KMOV, \"and I responded I was too tired to think about it right now.\" The suspect, in his 20s, stood up. \"The next thing I know, he sucker punches me right in the middle of my face,\" the victim said. The video showed the suspect unleashing a barrage of punches at the head of the victim, who covered himself with his hand and forearms. The two other men, also in their 20s, joined in, police said. As the train pulled into a station, a security guard saw part of the beating and alerted police. The man in the red T-shirt could be seen on video kicking at the victim's face before the train's doors opened and the assailants ran out. The train's surveillance cameras captured clear images of their faces, which MetroLink passed on to journalists. Police are looking for the three men. They face possible charges of third-degree assault, police said. It is a misdemeanor under Missouri law. The victim was left with bruises on his face and forehead, police said. The first punch dug the frame of his eyeglasses into the skin of his nose, the victim said.  He declined to receive medical treatment. But then there was the emotional pain. On the video, people could be heard laughing while the man was beaten. \"I think it was disgusting that people were sort of laughing and smiling about it,\" the victim said. \"And no one offered to help. No one seemed to call 911.\" Condemnation of the beating has spread across social media, including from people who protested the shooting of Brown last year by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. The officer was not indicted in Brown's death. St. Louis alderman Antonio French, a vocal community leader in the aftermath of Ferguson, tweeted his disappointment in the beating. \"Mike Brown question sparks MetroLink beating caught on video,\" he wrote. \"This is disgusting.

{"article":"(CNN)Astronauts on the International Space Station completed a spacewalk Sunday despite the appearance of water inside an astronaut's helmet, NASA reported. In a tweet, the space agency said astronaut Terry Virts experienced water inside his helmet, just as he did Wednesday, but \"it's a known issue; no concern.\" The spacewalk lasted five hours and 38 minutes, NASA said. \"Crews have now spent a total of 1,171 hours and 29 minutes conducting space station assembly and maintenance during 187 spacewalks,\" the agency said in a release. NASA previously said the suit worn by NASA astronaut Virts has a history of \"sublimator water carryover.\" Water in the sublimator cooling component can condense when the suit is repressurized after a spacewalk, causing a small amount of water to push into the helmet, NASA said. NASA said International Space Station managers had \"a high degree of confidence\" in the suit. On the upcoming spacewalk, Virts and Barry Wilmore installed antennas to provide data to visiting vehicles and deploy 400 feet of cable along the edge of the station. Virts said he first noticed traces of fluid and dampness in his helmet Wednesday while he was waiting for the crew lock cabin to repressurize. He and Wilmore had been outside  the space station for nearly seven hours working on the station's robotic arm and performing some maintenance. Virts immediately alerted  fellow astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti about the water, and she alerted Mission Control in Houston. Cristoforetti helped Virts out of his helmet and examined it. She confirmed the presence of moisture, mostly in the helmet absorption pad, or HAP, describing it as \"wet and cold.\" At the request of Mission Control, Anton Shkaplerov used a syringe to draw as much water as he could from the top of the helmet.  Water had collected in the white plastic at the top and around both ear cups.  Shkaplerov estimated there was 15 milliliters of water in the helmet. That's a far cry from the amount of water that accumulated in Luca Parmitano's suit during a spacewalk in July 2013.  Between 1 and 1.5 liters of water backed up in the suit and helmet, prompting fears Parmitano could drown in his own helmet.  The spacewalk was cut short, and NASA implemented some changes to its suits, including the addition of absorbent padding in helmets. There was another intrusion of water into the helmet during another spacewalk on December 24, 2013.  NASA commentator Rob Navias said it was noticed at the same point in the mission as Wednesday's leak -- during the repressurization of the crew lock, the area from which astronauts enter and exit ISS while in space.","highlights":"Spacewalk last more than five hours; crews have spent more than 1,171 hours spacewalking .\nAstronaut Terry Virts found a small amount of water inside his helmet ."}

Short video, which was uploaded earlier today, shows a dejected 'John Terry' standing on the platform of the Paris metro as a train pulls into the station. The carriage is packed with a gang of PSG fans, who are chanting 'Here is Paris' in a good humoured fashion at the man, who is wearing a replica \u00a0shirt bearing the Chelsea captain's name. A dejected 'John Terry' stands on a Paris Metro station following his side's Champions League exit . The man, wearing a Terry 26 jersey waits for the speeding train to stop before he can board . Unfortunately, the carriage is full of jubilant Paris St Germain fans who are through to the next round . As the fake John Terry attempts to board the train, he is pushed back by the smiling fans. The video is a response to a video featuring Chelsea fans on the Paris metro where a black man is prevented from boarding the train.

In a final barb to Chelsea fans, the video features a shot of a sign with the Champions League logo and Berlin 2015 - where the final is being held. Chelsea had offered the victim of the Paris metro racism row a free trip to last night's second leg. But the victim, Soulemayne S said he could not go to the game because of the impact of last month's incident. He said: 'This offer to go, this invitation, is just an attempt to make things up. For the moment I don't want to come because of what they've caused, the team and their fans. 'The Chelsea supporters have destroyed me. Even when I drive my car I feel like I'm being followed.

Meanwhile, five men linked to the incident have been served with summonses to appear at Waltham Forest Magistrates' Court on March 25 'regarding a police application for football banning orders'. Football banning orders are issued by courts following a conviction for a football-related offence after a complaint by the Crown Prosecution Service or local police, the Home Office website says. They can last for between three and 10 years. Breaches of the orders can result in a sentence of up to six months in prison.

{"article":"(CNN)It was nothing if not predictable. Take combustible issues like religion and sexuality, stir in a new law and talk of a boycott, then -- boom! -- the debate on social media explodes. And so it has proved with Indiana's new \"religious freedom\" law, signed Thursday by Gov. Mike Pence. The new law could allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers if serving them would contravene the business owner's religious beliefs. Supporters of the bill say it protects their right to believe as they choose. Opponents say it is nothing but bigotry dressed up as liberty. The debate is nothing if not vitriolic. And colorful, too. \"Libs SHUTUP,\" reads one tweet, which goes on to assert that Indiana's \"Relgious Freedom Restauration Act (sic)\" is modeled on federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. People on the other side of the debate are equally emphatic -- and, it seems for the moment, more numerous. Some have likened the new law to permitting businesses to discriminate against black people, if perchance their religion dictated that. Others say that Indiana seems out of step with modern times. And then there is the business reaction -- both the nascent boycott from outside the state and the rush by some businesses inside the state to declare that, law or no law, they have no intention of turning anyone away. \"My team just canceled travel to IN due to the #ReligiousFreedomRestorationAct,\" tweeted a user under the name Mark C Somerville, who says he works for @salesforce. \"We stand against discrimination.\" And a tweet from a the St. Elmo Steak House, a business in Indianapolis, the state's capital and its largest city, pledged in capital letters to continue serving ALL. The word Freedom should only be used when it's inclusive and fair for all. Supporters of the law, however, made it clear what they thought opponents should do with their proposed boycott. \"Before you go and get too self-righteous w\/ your #BoycottIndiana,\" a user called Caleb Parke tweeted, \"@GovPenceIN is protecting #religiousfreedom for EVERYONE! #EqualRights.\"","highlights":"Social media supporters of Indiana's \"religious freedom\" bill say it protects their right to hold their own beliefs.\nOpponents of the bill say its \"freedom\" is a cover for bigotry against gays and lesbians.\nSome Indiana businesses tweet that they will continue to serve all customers, regardless of orientation.\nSome users take to social media in attempt to organize boycott of Indiana ."}

{"article":"(CNN)As long as 7,000 years ago, the Chinchorro people who lived along the desert coast of what is now Chile and Peru were mummifying the bodies of those who died. But, after millennia in which the mummies have remained well preserved, those ancient remains are now in danger of rapid decomposition, Harvard scientists have warned. The culprit? According to the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, in a news report published Monday, rising humidity that helps microbes flourish on the mummies' skin is to blame. As a result, scientists at the University of Tarapaca's archeological museum in Arica, northern Chile, have already seen some of its 120 prized examples of Chinchorro mummies start turning into a \"black ooze,\" it said. Egypt dig unearths 3,600-year-old mummy . The role of rising humidity was confirmed through testing on skin samples by Harvard professor Ralph Mitchell and researcher Alice DeAraujo, according to the news release. Their findings will help conservationists in Arica -- an arid area where humidity levels have been increasing in recent years -- safeguard their precious relics. Egypt's mummies get CT scans . But Mitchell said he was concerned about potentially hundreds more mummies buried just below the sandy surface in the valleys of northern Chile. \"You have these bodies out there and you're asking the question: How do I stop them from decomposing? It's almost a forensic problem,\" he is quoted as saying. A \"complicated process\" was used to prepare the mummies, said Marcela Sepulveda, professor of archaeology at the University of Tarapaca, cited in the news release.

{"article":"New Delhi, India (CNN)A mob, consisting of thousands of people, stormed a prison compound in India's far northeast, dragging out a rape suspect before beating him to death on the streets on Thursday, authorities say. Police say they tried to stave off the mob with tear gas and opened fire, killing one person. The crowd targeted a 35-year-old suspect, identified as an undocumented Bangladeshi settler, who died of his injuries before officers could rescue him, said L.L. Doungal, the director-general of police in the remote Nagaland state, where the attack took place. The mob that broke into the main jail in the state's Dimapur district was comprised of \"thousands\" of people, Doungal told CNN. \"Many of them were students in uniform,\" he said. The suspect was accused of raping a local woman on February 23. Tensions between the native Naga and undocumented Bangladeshi migrants in the district have been simmering for some time, police said. On Thursday evening, thousands of people who were demanding the cancellation of trade permits for Bengali-speaking settlers, tore into the prison complex and pulled the suspect out. Police initially used tear gas and bamboo canes to rescue the inmate, but were not successful, Doungal said. \"There were students in uniform. So, we had to use minimum force,\" he said. The crowd planned to lynch the suspect, but he died from critical injuries suffered in the attack. \"We retrieved his body before it could be (hanged),\" Doungal said. Dimapur town has been placed under curfew, according to the officer, as the situation remains volatile.","highlights":"Mob pulls rape suspect out of jail and kills him .\nSuspect was undocumented Bangladeshi settler .\nRacial tensions between local Naga people and Bangladeshi migrants high ."}
{"article":"(CNN)After postponing its first execution of a woman in 70 years because of \"cloudy\" lethal injection drugs, Georgia has indefinitely postponed at least one other execution until it can analyze the cocktail it uses for the procedures, the state said Tuesday. Kelly Renee Gissendaner was scheduled to die at 7 p.m. ET Monday, but for the second time in less than a week, it was called off. The state postponed the first planned execution because of \"weather and associated scheduling issues,\" department spokeswoman Gwendolyn Hogan said. \"Prior to the execution, the drugs were sent to an independent lab for testing of potency. The drugs fell within the acceptable testing limits,\" the Georgia Department of Corrections said in a statement. \"Within the hours leading up to the scheduled execution, the Execution Team performed the necessary checks. At that time, the drugs appeared cloudy. The Department of Corrections immediately consulted with a pharmacist, and in an abundance of caution, Inmate Gissendaner's execution has been postponed.\" Repeating the \"abundance of caution\" wording, the department issued a news release Tuesday, saying, \"The scheduled executions of Kelly Renee Gissendaner and Brian Keith Terrell have been postponed while an analysis is conducted of the drugs planned for use in last night's scheduled execution of inmate Gissendaner.\" Gissendaner, 47, is condemned to die for a 1997 murder plot in which she conspired with boyfriend Gregory Owen to murder her husband. Terrell was convicted in the shooting and beating death of a 70-year-old friend of his mother's after the man called police to say Terrell had stolen checks from him, according to the Georgia attorney general's office. Gissendaner has already requested an extravagant last meal: two Burger King Whoppers with cheese (with everything), two large orders of fries, popcorn, cornbread, a side of buttermilk and a salad with tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, carrots, cheese, boiled eggs and Newman's Own buttermilk dressing, the Corrections Department said. She also requested a glass of lemonade and cherry-vanilla ice cream for dessert. Terrell was scheduled to die between March 10 and 17. Last year, Oklahoma issued a months-long moratorium on executions after murderer and rapist Clayton Lockett convulsed, writhed and lay alive on a gurney for 43 minutes before dying. It was the state's first time using a new, three-drug cocktail for an execution. The constitutionality of lethal injection drugs has made headlines since 2013, when European manufacturers -- including Denmark-based Lundbeck, which manufactures pentobarbital -- banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions. Thirty-two states were left to find new drug protocols.","highlights":"Brian Keith Terrell execution halted while Georgia analyzes drugs used for executions .\nKelly Gissendaner's execution postponed because drugs \"appeared cloudy,\" Georgia says ."}
{"article":"(CNN)The University of North Carolina will pay whistleblower Mary Willingham $335,000 to settle her lawsuit with the university, following the largest academic fraud scandal in NCAA history. Willingham is the former athletics literacy counselor who blew the whistle about the fake classes that went on for nearly 20 years at the prestigious university. Willingham spent years fielding attacks from university officials -- including accusations that she was lying when she said that officials within the athletic department steered underprepared athletes into the fake classes to keep them eligible. For nearly five years, UNC denied those claims, but Willingham refused to keep quiet. She first told her story to the News & Observer in Raleigh, and then to national media when the university refused to admit that the classes were well-known to faculty. The added attention forced UNC to hire a new investigator and launch a new probe in 2014. That latest review, led by Ken Wainstein, a 19-year veteran of the U.S. Justice Department, found exactly what Willingham had always claimed -- widespread and systematic cheating. Willingham left her job last spring after complaining that she was being retaliated against. \"The University's settlement with Mrs. Willingham resolves all of the outstanding legal issues in the case,\" said Rick White, associate vice chancellor of communications and public affairs. \"We appreciate the efforts of the mediator to help us achieve a successful and timely conclusion to the mediation. We believe the settlement is in the best interest of the University and allows us to move forward and fully focus on other important issues.\" When she sued, Willingham said she hoped to accomplish what no other investigation has done -- to subpoena documents and to depose university officials under oath. Her lawsuit never got that far. Instead, she says she's hoping that will be accomplished by a larger class-action lawsuit filed by powerhouse attorney Michael Hausfeld on behalf of two former UNC athletes. Devon Ramsay and Rashanda McCants both sued in January, saying they were promised an education but didn't get one because of the paper class scandal. Hausfeld is the attorney who beat the NCAA last summer in federal court on behalf of former UCLA player Ed O'Bannon, winning a case that will forever change college sports by forcing the NCAA to eliminate the rule that forbids schools from paying players. That lawsuit is the reason Willingham says she was OK with entering into mediation in her whistleblower suit. She shared the settlement document with CNN. \"It's about the students and not about me. I don't need it to be about me,\" Willingham said. \"I got an education, but those students left without one, and we still have a system that doesn't work. And so I'm hopeful that (the Hausfeld lawsuit) will move forward and prove that (NCAA Division I) schools all across the country have a flawed system where a promise of an education isn't happening, and therefore these students are getting nothing.\" Willingham is co-founder of Paper Class Inc., which serves as a portal and rallying point for the college sports reform movement and includes a program to give students reading help in middle school.

{"article":"(CNN)Three Florida police officers were fired and a fourth resigned after exchanging a series of racially offensive text messages and a video that portrayed President Barack Obama in a derogatory way, Fort Lauderdale police said. Jason Holding, James Wells and Christopher Sousa were terminated after a five-month internal affairs investigation found sustained department misconduct, conduct unbecoming of a police officer and engaging in \"conduct prejudicial to the good of the order of the police department.\" A fourth officer, Alex Alvarez, resigned but authorities said Friday that he would have been fired had he not done so. In the text message exchanges, the former officers used racially derogatory terms to refer to people they encountered while on duty, included  racially insensitive material from the film, \"Django Unchained,\" and talked about getting drunk and \"killing n*****,\" according to investigative documents. The men allegedly criticized co-workers, including African-Americans, making crude comments about their grammar, appearance and work ethic. One message referred to an entire shift as \"lazy f****,\" the documents state. Alvarez created a faux movie trailer with the title \"The Hoods,\" with offensive language and images of Obama, the Ku Klux Klan and African-Americans. \"There was no criminal behavior detected during this investigation, however, the four officers' conduct was inexcusable and there is zero tolerance for this kind of behavior in the Fort Lauderdale Police Department,\" Chief Franklin Adderley told reporters. \"Its attempt was to damage the image of our agency and I just hope that the people and the public realize that we're not going to tolerate it and anyone that's engaged in this behavior will be addressed immediately,\" he said. In a statement, the Fort Lauderdale Fraternal Order of Police said the officers deserve their due process, CNN affiliate WSVN reported. \"The Fraternal Order of Police is a multicultural organization which does not tolerate racism,\" the group's president, Jack Lokeinsky, said in the statement. \"Our officers take great pride in our commitment to diversity. Our dedicated officers have positive relationships with residents in every community we serve.\" The officers worked in a predominantly African-American neighborhood. \"I am very disappointed, disgusted and shocked by this incident,\" Mayor Jack Seiler said. \"The inappropriate racist behavior exhibited by those involved is unacceptable and reprehensible, it violates the trust we place in our law enforcement officers, it damages the bond we have established in our community and undermines the standards in which each and every city employee is held accountable,\" Seiler said at a news conference. Police officials were alerted of the existence of offensive material by Alvarez's ex-fiancee, who discovered it when the couple agreed to check each others' phones, according to the documents. The woman told police she thought their behavior was wrong, but feared he would hurt her if she told anyone. After the 10-month relationship ended, she went to the authorities. Adderley said that four officers had not exhibited a pattern of race-related complaints. Holding was recently disciplined with a two-day suspension for mishandling property of a suspect. The police department is implementing a mandatory \"diversity class\" for officers and a screening process for new hires,  said Adderley.","highlights":"Fort Lauderdale officers exchanged racially offensive text messages .\nThree officers were fired, a fourth resigned .\nPolice chief: \"There was no criminal behavior detected\""}

{"article":"David Denton insists Scotland will look to bounce back from their Wooden Spoon shame by winning this year's World Cup. The Dark Blues had a nightmare RBS 6 Nations as they lost all five games, suffering their third whitewash in 11 years. But Edinburgh number eight Denton believes the Scots can brush off their embarrassment by lifting the Webb Ellis Cup at Twickenham on October 31. David Denton believes Scotland can bounce back from a nightmare Six Nations by winning the World Cup . Scotland have been drawn in Pool B alongside South Africa, Samoa, Japan and the US. They kick-off their World Cup bid on September 23 against the Japanese in Gloucester. Asked if he still believed the side would look to challenge the best nations in the world for the trophy, he replied: 'Yes'. Pushed further on that statement, he added: 'I understand it's hard to see. Our first goal is to get out of the pool and then give ourselves every chance of winning the World Cup. 'We never change [our views on what we can achieve]. We are in this sport to win. There is no doubt about that. There is a process to getting there - we need to get out of our pool first. Scotland were thrashed 40-10 by Ireland on their own patch at Murrayfield on Saturday . 'We're in a tough pool - it could have been worse. We have tough games particularly against South Africa and Samoa that we need to make sure we perform well in. 'It's a pool I think we can do well in and then [if] we get a favourable quarter-final we move on from there. You just need to take it one game at time and that's what we are going to do.' Scotland ended their campaign with another hard-luck story as Ireland steamrollered their way to a thrilling title triumph with a 40-10 win. And Denton admits it was not the way he saw the championships going. Scotland lost all five of their Six Nations matches in 2015 to finish at the bottom of the table . 'Today was a disappointing end to a disappointing campaign,' he said. 'We came in to this competition with a lot of ambition and the prospect of winning the trophy. We came in thinking we were a good enough team to do that. 'But a few of the results didn't go our way and today we weren't good enough. 'There are a lot of things we can improve on and we will do. 'Was it realistic to think we can win the title? One hundred per cent. There was no ambiguity about. (Coach) Vern (Cotter) said it at the start and we all believed it.

{"article":"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)The U.S. military has pulled its remaining personnel out of Yemen due to the deteriorating security situation, the U.S. State Department said. The evacuation involved about 100 Special Operations forces members from the Al Anad airbase, sources in the region familiar with the situation told CNN. The State Department called it a temporary relocation. Those evacuated, which include Navy SEALs and members of the Army's Delta Force, were the last American forces stationed in the Arab nation, which is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terrorist group also known as AQAP. \"We ... continue to actively monitor terrorist threats emanating from Yemen and have capabilities postured in the area to address them,\" State Department Spokesman Jeff Rathke said late Saturday.  \"As we have in the past, we will take action to disrupt continuing, imminent threats to the United States and our citizens.\" The United States closed its embassy in Sanaa last month, after Houthi rebels took over the Yemeni capital. And hundreds of al Qaeda members escaped two Yemeni prisons Thursday and Friday, raising further security questions. \"There is no military solution to Yemen's current crisis,\" Jeff Rathke said.  \"We urge the immediate cessation of all unilateral and offensive military actions.\" The United Nations is taking the situation seriously. The Security Council will meet at 3 p.m. ET Sunday to discuss Yemen, the French mission said Saturday via Twitter. For years, the U.S. military has worked closely with Yemen's government to go after AQAP, together carrying out numerous attacks like the 2011 drone strike that killed prominent al Qaeda figure Anwar al-Awlaki. And U.S. President Barack Obama has hailed this cooperation as a pillar in his anti-terrorism campaign. \"Yemen has never been a perfect democracy or a island of stability,\" Obama said in January, promoting the policy of \"partnering and intelligence-sharing with that local government\" as the best approach in a bad situation. \"The alternative would be for us to play whack-a-mole every time there is a terrorist actor inside of any given country,\" the President said. But while there have been drone strikes as recently as last month, these cooperative efforts have been hampered by Yemen's growing difficulty in maintaining unity and peace. These include the rise of the Houthis, their battles with forces loyal to ousted President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi and the presence of not only al Qaeda fighters but other militants. On Friday, for instance, ISIS purportedly claimed responsibility for bombings at two mosques in Sanaa what, if true, would mark that group's first large-scale attack in Yemen. The claim came in a statement posted on a site that previously carried ISIS proclamations, but couldn't be immediately authenticated by CNN. Those blasts killed at least 137 people and wounded 357 others, according to Yemen's state-run Saba news agency. While ISIS and al Qaeda are both Sunni groups that espouse extreme versions of Islam and violent opposition to the West, that doesn't mean they will be working together anytime soon. In fact, AQAP strongly rebuked ISIS in a video released in November, characterizing its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's declaration of an Islamic caliphate as illegitimate. More than anything, the idea of the group calling itself the Islamic State violently flexing its muscles speaks to the chaotic situation there. With no one really in control, that means numerous groups -- including those with a history of killing civilians and lashing out at the West -- have been more room to operate and a better chance potentially to take over. Meanwhile, the main players for control of Yemen's government -- those siding with Hadi, who still claims to be president after being deposed earlier this year, and the Houthis, a minority group that's strongest in the northern part of the country -- remain very much at odds. Just two days ago, a Yemeni jet commanded by the capital's Houthi conquerors fired missiles at a palace housing Hadi in the port city of Aden. No one was injured, but the direct strike nonetheless marked an escalation in the deadly fighting between the two sides. The airstrikes came on the same day opposing Yemeni military forces -- some under the Houthis, others led by officers loyal to Hadi -- battled in Aden, said Aden Gov. AbdulAziz Hobtour. At least 13 people died and 21 others were injured in those clashes, according to Hobtour. Hadi took to the airwaves of Adan TV, a station he recently started, on Saturday in his first televised speech since escaping house arrest. He called on all political factions to take part in upcoming talks in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, condemning the Aden strike and urging Yemeni troops to refuse orders from Houthi officials. Hadi tied the Houthis to Iran, which he was said supported the \"coup\" that led to his departure from Aden. \"The Iranian agenda of the Houthis will not last,\" he said. After Hadi spoke, the Houthi-run SABA news agency responded, saying the Supreme Revolutionary Committee has decided to mobilize forces and \"directed security and military institutions to carry out their duties to confront (the) dirty war.\" \"The Committee announces the decision to call proud sons of the Yemeni people in all regions to unite, collaborate and cooperate with members of the armed and security forces in the face of terrorist forces in all parts of the country,\" the report said. Mohammed Al Bukhaiti, a top member of the Houthi Political Council, said Hadi's speech won't help Yemen reach a peaceful resolution and accused him of reneging on a deal last September to transfer power. \"We blame Hadi for not implementing this deal that drew the road map that would have solved Yemen's ongoing crises,\" Al Bukhaiti said. \"Hadi will be held responsible for the country's failures and that chaos that could follow.\" Journalist Hakim Almasmari reported from Sanaa, and CNN's Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Ed Payne and Laura Koran contributed to this report.","highlights":"U.S. military forces have been evacuated from Al Anad airbase .\nU.N.

{"article":"(CNN)A crowd of tens of thousands filled Yitzhak Rabin Square in Tel Aviv on Saturday evening, calling for a change in Israeli leadership amid growing discontent with the current administration. The rally, called \"Israel Wants Change,\" was put on by One Million Hands, a grassroots movement that focuses its efforts on two major issues: a two-state solution and a reduction in the cost of living. On both of these topics, founder Dror Ben-Ami says, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has failed. \"We think that the only way to go forward on that account is to change government and to get this current government out of office. To get Bibi out of office,\" says Ben-Ami. Organizers are not promoting any specific candidate or pushing voters toward any political party in the March 17 balloting. Instead, they are encouraging voters to change the current administration. Police estimated the crowd at 40,000 people. Headlining the rally was Meir Dagan, the former head of Mossad, Israel's spy agency, and a vocal critic of Netanyahu. In recent weeks, Dagan criticized Netanyahu's decision to speak before the U.S. Congress, and he continued his criticism at the rally, saying that he has never seen such stagnation in Israeli politics. Netanyahu still has broad support in Israel, and his Likud party is doing well in the polls. The Zionist Union is Likud's primary challenger. In the initial round of polling immediately following Netanyahu's speech before Congress, the Zionist Union was expected to win 24 seats in the Knesset while Likud was expected to win 23 seats. The poll comes from CNN affiliate Channel 2 Israel. Because of the nature of Israeli politics, Netanyahu's Likud party could lose the election while Netanyahu still becomes prime minister. In many ways, this rally was reminiscent of a similar social movement that began in the summer of 2011. Hundreds of thousands of protesters packed the streets of Tel Aviv, demanding improvements in the cost of housing, education, and health care. What started as a small social media campaign turned into a nationwide movement that spread to other major cities. This time, the issues are different. But the growing sense of discontent and the calls for change remain.","highlights":"Group One Million Hands sponsors event in Tel Aviv .\nThey want to see a new prime minister .\nIsraeli elections come March 17 ."}

The 67-year-old will sign a short-term deal until the end of the season and his package will be incentivised with the target of survival. Advocaat told Voetbal International: 'I am now in a dark hotel, but soon I'll be working in the Stadium of Light.' Dick Advocaat, pictured here in charge of PSV Eindhoven in 2012, is set to take charge at Sunderland . Gus Poyet has been sacked by Sunderland with the club just one point above the relegation zone . Sunderland supporters turned on manager Poyet after their side were thrashed 4-0 by Aston Villa . 525 - Poyet's number of days in charge since his arrival on October 8, 2013. 75 - The Uruguayan's number of games in charge, winning 23, losing 22 and drawing 30. 3 - The number of games against bitter rivals Newcastle. He won them all with an aggregate of 6-1. 35 - Poyet was the 35th man to manage Sunderland either permanently or as a caretaker. 22 - The number of years between Sunderland's appearances in a major final. Poyet took them to the 2014 Capital One Cup final, 22 years on from their defeat to Liverpool in the FA Cup showpiece. They lost to Manchester City. 14 - Sunderland's final position in Poyet's first season. 4 - The amount of games won in the Premier League by Sunderland this season. The joint-worst with bottom side Leicester. Advocaat could land up to \u00a3500,000 if the Black Cats \u2013 currently one point above the relegation zone \u2013 avoid the drop. He will bring with him Montenegrin coach Zeljko Petrovic, who was Avram Grant's assistant at West Ham in 2010. It is unlikely, however, that Advocaat will be considered as the permanent successor to Gus Poyet, who was sacked yesterday after 17 months at the Stadium of Light. Sportsmail\u00a0understands that West Ham manager Sam Allardyce and Real Madrid assistant Paul Clement are at the top of the club's shortlist to take charge beyond this season. Clement, in particular, fits the profile of coach who could work within the structure at the club, where sporting director Lee Congerton has control over transfers. Clement and Congerton know each other from their time at Chelsea and the Real No 2 is thought to be keen to try his hand as a manager back in England. Meanwhile, it is Congerton's contacts book which has led to talks with Advocaat. Former Chelsea sporting director Frank Arnesen \u2013 who worked with Advocaat at PSV Eindhoven and Congerton at Stamford Bridge and then Hamburg \u2013 has recommended him for the role and he will be installed before Saturday's trip to West Ham. Advocaat could land up to \u00a3500,000 if the Black Cats \u2013  one point above the drop zone \u2013 avoid relegation . 'This is something I always wanted to do, the Premier League. The Premier League is a phenomenal competition,' Advocaat told AD Sportwereld. 'As a manager that is where you want to work, that has such a pulling power. 'Saturday, West Ham awaits. And then there's the international break. And then \u2013 the derby with Newcastle United. That is really something to look forward to because believe me, this just is a very big club.' Sunderland owner Ellis Short moved swiftly to dismiss Poyet during a telephone conversation after training on Monday. It is understood the Uruguayan asked for his contract \u2013 which expires in 2016 \u2013 to be paid up in full after he was informed that his position had become untenable. Zeljko Petrovic, who was Avram Grant's assistant at West Ham in 2010, will work alongside Advocaat . West Ham boss Sam Allardyce could be the long-term successor to Poyet at the Stadium of Light . His assistant Mauricio Taricco and first-team coach Charlie Oatway are also set to leave the club. Former Sunderland favourites and academy coaches Kevin Ball and Paul Bracewell will now be on hand to help at senior level. Short acted on the advice of the influential Congerton and chief executive Margaret Byrne in getting rid of Poyet. They felt there was no way back for the head coach following Saturday's 4-0 defeat at home to Aston Villa. Supporters tried to storm the dugout and also let their feelings be known to those seated in the directors' box. The decision was soon made to dispense with Poyet and contact initiated with Advocaat, who left his post as Serbia national team manager in November after just five months in charge. His first home game will be the visit of North-East rivals Newcastle on Easter Sunday.","highlights":"Dick Advocaat will sign a short-term deal until the end of the season .\nHe\u00a0will be tasked with keeping the Black Cats in the Premier League .\nIt is unlikely he will be the long-term successor to Gus Poyet with West Ham boss Sam Allardyce and Real Madrid No 2 Paul Clement in the frame .\nAdvocaat expected to be\u00a0installed\u00a0before Sunderland's trip to West Ham ."}

Tuttosport's message is the most resounding, with their front page specifically calling for Juve to attack at the\u00a0Signal Iduna Park making it clear that in order to qualify, the Old Lady need goals. The paper also calls for Argentine winger\u00a0Roberto Pereyra to be used in a 4-3-1-2 system by Allegri - who it also reports is set to be offered a new contract. Both Gazzetta and Corriere look to Juventus' talisman, former Manchester City and Manchester United striker, Carlos Tevez. Gazzetta also want to see Pereyra deployed in a 4-3-1-2 behind Tevez and Alvaro Morata in a game that could be worth \u00a36.5million to Juve. Carlos Tevez trains ahead of the last-16 tie, and the Italian papers see him as a key man for Juventus . Paul Pogba takes a moment away from the training session as Juventus look to hold on to their lead . Meanwhile, Corriere calls for the 'class of Tevez and super defence to tackle Klopp'. 'We go into the game with an advantage,' Allegri said ahead of the game. 'We know the difficulties of the task ahead of us, no doubt about it. 'I don't expect it to end 0-0. We need to score at least once and if we could score two goals it would be great.' Allegri believes the game in Dortmund will not end 0-0 and that his side will need to find a way to score . Alvaro Morata hits a pass during training, and Gazzetta dello Sport want him upfront alongside Tevez . The Germans have been improving in recent weeks after a bad first half to the Bundesliga season and have lost none of their last six league games. They are also unbeaten at home in Europe this season although they have lost all three previous encounters against the Italians in Dortmund. 'We have to be ready for the strengths of Dortmund, their speed, their pressure,' the Italian coach added. 'We have to have a technically perfect game and pounce on their weaknesses.' The Italian papers called for Tevez to lead the attack at the Signal Iduna Park while Juve's defence holds firm . Roberto Pereyra (second right) is seen as a key man by the Italian papers, who want him deployed in a 4-3-1-2 .","highlights":"Juventus travel to Borussia Dortmund in their last-16 tie second leg .\nThe Italian champions won first leg 2-1 after Alvaro Morata's winner .\nItalian papers back Massimiliano Allegri's calls for Juventus to attack .\nGazzetta dello Sport and Tuttosport call for Juve to use 4-3-1-2 system .\nCorriere dello Sport want Carlos Tevez to guide the team through .\nAllegri has admitted Juve must score in Germany to reach quarter-finals ."}
{"article":"Kevin Pietersen has yet to consider Leicestershire's bold attempt to sign him for this summer's NatWest T20 Blast. After new England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves hinted last weekend there is still a possibility of a return to international cricket for the record-breaking batsman, sacked last year, the first definite attempt by a county to secure his services surfaced on Friday. Leicestershire chief executive Wasim Khan told Cricinfo he had been in touch with Pietersen's advisers about the possibility of signing the 34-year-old between his existing commitments at the Indian and Caribbean premier leagues. Kevin Pietersen played for Surrey in last year's Natwest Twenty20 Blast . Pietersen's agent confirmed an initial discussion did take place, but added it was 'some time ago'. Leicestershire's gambit therefore appears to pre-date Graves' remarks, in which he indicated Pietersen's return to county cricket - as a pre-requisite of being considered again for England - would need to encompass all formats, rather than just Twenty20. Wasim told Cricinfo: 'I approached his agent about his T20 availability. 'But he said it was unlikely he would play any T20 (in England) due to his full CPL commitments.' The former England batsman pictured watching QPR's 2-1 defeat by Arsenal on Wednesday night . Pietersen's agent said: 'I haven't had a conversation with Kevin about Leicestershire - it is not something we have discussed.' Pietersen, who was axed by the ECB 13 months ago after England's 2013\/14 Ashes whitewash defeat and described by his employers' managing director Paul Downton as 'disengaged', has since published an autobiography in which he is very critical of several former team-mates and management staff. He played for Surrey in last year's domestic T20 competition, but was de-registered by them at the end of the season. Pietersen, playing for Melbourne Stars, waits to bat in the Big Bash League semi-final in January .","highlights":"Leicestershire have made bold attempt to sign Kevin Pietersen for T20 .\nThey want Piertersen to play between Caribbean and Indian commitments .\nFormer England batsman's agent says he hasn't had a conversation with Pietersen about the offer ."}

{"article":"(CNN)There is plenty of noise surrounding the nuclear deal that is being negotiated with Iran. But for all the heat generated by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress and an ill-conceived, panicky letter to Iran's leadership organized by Sen.Tom Cotton -- the latest debate is creating little light. Indeed, it may actually be obscuring the fundamental issue of Iran's own foreign policies -- and whether Tehran's destabilizing activities abroad should preclude a deal at all. Unfortunately, few in Congress have taken the time to consider the matter in a thoughtful, coherent manner. There are, of course, certain realities that should not be in dispute: Yes, Iran is a regional adversary to a number of its Gulf neighbors and Israel. And it does aim to provoke Sunni-led Gulf states and generally to sow seeds of sectarian Islam abroad. In addition, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp's Quds force is alleged to have provided training and weapons to a range of militants -- Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories, Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, Houthi rebels in Yemen, disenfranchised Shia Muslims in Bahrain, and even to militant groups in West Africa. Most recently, Iran has been directing military operations by U.S.-equipped Iraqi forces against ISIS militants in Iraq, forces that have been aided by U.S. airstrikes. Netanyahu grasped the irony, starkly warning \"when it comes to Iran and ISIS, the enemy of your enemy is your enemy.\" (Although Sen. Marco Rubio appears to be confused, insisting at a March 11 hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Iran must be unhappy with U.S. airstrikes against ISIS). Yet the question that Netanyahu did not answer, and which Sen. Cotton and his 46 colleagues have not even asked, is what exactly should be done about Iran's activities abroad? Many in Congress fail to grasp that Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and his colleagues in Iran's Cabinet, with their U.S.-PhDs and understanding of plural democracies, are not cut from the same cloth as the hardliners in charge of Iran's Quds force (its commander, Qasem Suleimani turns up in Lebanon and Iraq despite a travel and asset ban).  And yes, it was the Quds force that provided the explosives and operatives that led to significant U.S. casualties in the early years of the 2003 Iraq war. To answer the question of what to do about Iran's activities, it is important to understand that the nuclear agreement, while it has little to do with Iran's arms transfers or extracurricular activities in the region, can lay the groundwork for a far more serious engagement about Iran's role in the region -- and in a manner that addresses head-on the concerns of its Sunni neighbors, many of whom are eager to resume longstanding trading relationships with Iran. The reality is that Iran's reemergence into the international community in a postnuclear deal environment would allow the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to assert its interests in the region, and to lay out expectations of Iran as a constructive partner. It might even lead to quiet, back-channel diplomacy about the future of Syria without al-Assad. None of this is possible in the absence of the nuclear deal. Once Iran begins to navigate its relationships as more than the isolated, nuclear-threshold pariah state it currently is, there will be less tolerance internationally for destabilizing arms transfers and the training of would-be insurgents. And there is no need to rely on Iran's word that it will refrain from such activities. As U.N. Security Council resolutions are rewritten to lift the ban on uranium enrichment in Iran, the ban on Iranian arms transfers can and should remain in place, with U.N. member states required to report to the Security Council any violations of that ban by Iran. Ultimately, as important as the nuclear issue is, the real promise of a deal is only partially about limiting the country's nuclear ambitions -- it is also about returning stability to a shattered region, exhausted and impoverished by war. Iran, the United States and Gulf allies can be partners in such a process with clear eyes and no illusions about how difficult it will be. A nuclear deal is just the beginning.","highlights":"Talks are continuing over Iran's nuclear program .\nJacqueline Shire: A nuclear deal is just the beginning ."}

{"article":"(CNN)If death is the big sleep, as it is sometimes called, is there anything wrong with a dying person choosing a medically induced smaller sleep -- deep sedation -- to avoid the pain of a terminal illness? Is it OK for a patient to choose to spend his or her final days on this mortal coil in what would amount to a medically induced coma? Or is it simply euthanasia in disguise? Members of the French Parliament offered resounding support Tuesday for the proposition that is should be permissible for doctors to induce sleep until death in terminally ill patients who are in pain. They approved a bill allowing that by a vote of 436-34. There were, however, 83 lawmakers who declined to vote -- a measure of just how contentious the issue has been. The bill goes now to the French Senate. Should it become law, doctors would be allowed to administer \"deep sedation until death\" to terminally ill patients who request it, and for whom palliative care would not ease the pain. The law would also allow doctors who have stopped life-saving measures to administer deep sedation, if they deem it appropriate, to terminally ill patients who are unable to give their consent. \"Everyone has the right to a death that is dignified and soothed,\" the proposed law says. And health professionals, it continues, should \"implement all the means at their disposal to fulfill this right.\" What the law entails, according to Jean Leonetti, the member of Parliament who proposed it, is simple: \"Sleep before death to avoid suffering.\" What it also entails is legal protection for doctors who, in fact, already sedate some dying patients, and who are sometimes taken to court by relatives as a result. Euthanasia is illegal in France, though President Francois Hollande promised in his 2012 campaign that he would reopen the issue. Polls show that more than 90% of French people support the proposal -- an astonishing majority for any proposal -- and Hollande has said it  would represent a big step forward. But, as might be predicted, the proposed law has proved divisive in the extreme. Some lawmakers on the left of the political spectrum said in advance they would abstain from Tuesday's vote because they thought the bill did not go far enough toward legalizing euthanasia. And some on the right said they, too, would abstain, because they saw the law is a way of legalizing euthanasia in disguise. CNN's Jim Bittermann in Paris contributed to this report .","highlights":"French Parliament approves Tuesday a bill that would allow doctors to put patients under deep sedation until they die .\nCritics call the proposed law euthanasia in disguise .\nMore than 90% of French people support the bill ."}

{"article":"Brendan Rodgers took radical steps to transform Liverpool\u2019s season as he feared a failure to do so would leave him in danger of being sacked. Liverpool\u2019s fortunes have transformed since Rodgers drastically switched his side\u2019s system to an attack-minded 3-4-3 formation in December; they are the form team in the Barclays Premier League, having taken 27 points from the last 33. The memory of how bad things were in November, though, has not left Rodgers and he has admitted that his experience at Reading, when he was axed in December 2009 after just 20 matches in charge, triggered his decision to rip things up and start again. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers speaks to his coaches during a training session at Melwood . The former Swansea City manager shares a joke with Ivorian defender Kolo Toure in training . Rodgers chats to England full back Glen Johnson during the training session at Melwood . Rodgers is highly-regarded by Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool\u2019s owners, and he signed a new long-term contract last May but the 42-year-old knows none of that would have mattered had his side\u2019s results continued on a downward spiral. \u2018I certainly wasn\u2019t going to roll over and die,\u2019 said Rodgers, whose side face Burnley On Wednesday. \u2018I love it here and I want to be successful. But after the Crystal Palace game (in November when Liverpool lost 3-1) in particular, I felt \"it doesn\u2019t matter how much support you have, the team is not functioning\". \u2018It could not go on, really. My experience at Reading told me that. That\u2019s what I learned from that sacking. I went in with the full backing of the chairman, who was great to me. Even though it was a three-year project and they wanted me there, I got the sack after 20 games. \u2018I learnt that it does not matter how much support you have in the boardroom, you have to get results \u2013 and you have to win. So I needed to make sure that I was going to make decisions which would allow us to get back to at least somewhere near where we were. Liverpool beat Premier League champions Manchester City 2-1 in their last league outing . Midfielders Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho both scored brilliant goals during the win . Rodgers admitted the fear of being sacked had driven him on to turn the club's results around . \u2018I think the transformation in the team has been really good to see; to see the confidence, and everyone talking about the system and how dynamic it is, and the fluency. I should have done it earlier! I am an innovative coach and I needed to find a way to make us play better.\u2019 At the lowest point in the campaign, when Liverpool tumbled out of the Champions League and were playing predictably, Rodgers\u2019 was noticeably subdued, particularly before they drew at home to Basel in December. He needed to lift himself as much as his players. \u2018We had a huge challenge, probably the biggest I have had as a coach or manager,\u2019 said Rodgers. \u2018We had no identity and everyone could see it. We just weren\u2019t the team I had created over a couple of years with an identity for the way we played. \u2018I knew I had to do something radical because I had seen enough of the players to know we were not going to be able to shape up and work and play as we had done for the previous couple of years with what we had got.

{"article":"Jonny Brownlee had to settle for fifth place in the opening World Triathlon Series race of the season in Abu Dhabi. The Olympic bronze medallist paid the price for slipping towards the back of a large leading pack at the end of the bike leg and was unable to close the gap to leading trio Mario Mola, Vincent Luis and Richard Murray on the run. Brownlee then lost out in a sprint finish to Joao Silva of Portugal but did at least have the consolation of beating great rival Javier Gomez, who could only manage sixth. Jonny Brownlee came a disappointing fifth after a poor bike leg in the World Triathlon Series in Abu Dhabi . Gomez's Spanish compatriot Mola was the class of the field over the sprint distance and pulled away during the second half of the five kilometres run to clinch a comfortable victory. Jonny's brother Alistair missed the race because of a minor ankle injury but, with Olympic qualification to be decided in August and September at the test event in Rio and the world series Grand Final in Chicago, none of the leading triathletes will want to peak too soon. Jonny, 24, said: 'I wanted better than that. I messed up everything I possibly could. That's what the first race is about. 'I thought my running was going well, but obviously not so well off the bike. I got into it later on but it was too late then. I just need to iron out the mistakes and sharpen up a little.' Brownlee celebrates after winning the silver medal in the men's Triathlon Final at Strathclyde Country Park . The women's race was once again dominated by world champion Gwen Jorgensen of the United States, with a disappointed Jodie Stimpson the leading British athlete in 17th. Stimpson, who won gold at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow last year, missed the front bike pack and was unable to make up any ground on the run, with a niggling Achilles problem not helping. Britain's former world champions Non Stanford and Helen Jenkins along with Commonwealth bronze medallist Vicky Holland all chose to stay at home and continue their training.

{"article":"London (CNN)It's a phenomenon that's been linked to a dragon, a black squirrel and Tiangiou, the magical dog of heaven. Mythologies from across the globe have blamed them all for eating the sun. In reality, solar eclipses, like the one that can be seen across parts of the Northern Hemisphere today, are down to an amazing coincidence. The moon and sun are at just the right distance away from the Earth that they appear to be of the same apparent size in the sky even though the sun is about 400 times larger than the moon. On occasion, the sun, moon and Earth are perfectly aligned so that when the moon passes in front of the sun it casts a shadow on the Earth, blocking the light. But that's not the whole story. A total eclipse can only be seen in the narrow corridor known as the \"path of totality\" --- or the \"inner umbral shadow.\" The area where the sun's rays are only partially obscured is called the \"penumbra.\" Today the moon's shadow falls across parts of North Africa, Europe and the Middle East. Millions will be in the penumbra part of the shadow and able to see a partial eclipse but if you want to catch the full majesty of the 2015 totality it will require a trip to the North Pole, Svalbard or the Faroe Islands between the UK and Norway. You can find out whether you will be able to see the eclipse by watching our animation. Solar eclipses are relatively common -- partial eclipses are visible somewhere on Earth most years -- but not necessarily in the same region. You might wait hundreds of years between two total eclipses at the same place. And not all eclipses are the same. The moon follows an elliptical orbit around the Earth which means it is sometimes closer to us -- at \"perigee\" -- and sometimes further away -- at \"apogee.\" At apogee, the moon doesn't appear quite big enough to completely obscure the sun during a solar eclipse and an observer sees a ring of brilliant light around the moon. This is called an annular eclipse. At perigee (as now) the sun will be completely blocked by the moon during totality. This gives scientists a chance to study the sun's atmosphere and help solve a cosmic conundrum. Astronomer Robert Massey of the UK's Royal Astronomical Society explained that the sun's atmosphere or corona is a massive 2 million degrees Celsius but the sun's surface only around 5,500 Celsius. He said this temperature difference has long mystified scientists. \"The eclipse at totality allows us to see the inner most regions of the sun's atmosphere even if it's only for a few minutes -- it's very hard to do otherwise,\" he said. Perhaps the brief window will give solar experts a chance to collect more data. But you don't have to be an astronomer to appreciate the incredible spectacle of an eclipse. CNN would like to see your pictures and videos and hear of your experiences by using CNN's eclipse iReport assignment-- but please take care. NEVER look directly at the sun -- it is dangerous and can cause permanent damage to your eyes. Regular sunglasses are NOT safe either. Special filters are needed. Ahead of last year's eclipse in the United States, NASA advised CNN readers: \"Even at maximum eclipse, a sliver of sun peeking out from behind the moon can still cause pain and eye damage. Direct viewing should only be attempted with the aid of a safe solar filter.\" NASA suggested some old tricks for viewing indirectly, like punching a hole in cardboard and projecting the light seeping through it onto a surface away from the sun. You can find more safety advice on NASA's eclipse website. A total solar eclipse is a phenomenon that won't last forever. The moon is moving away from the Earth at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters (about 1.5 inches) every year. There will come a time when the moon will appear to be too small to cover the sun. But don't worry, you still have to time to catch one -- NASA calculates this will take about 563 million years.","highlights":"Solar eclipses happen when the sun, moon and Earth are perfectly aligned so that when the moon passes in front of the sun it casts a shadow on the Earth .\nOn March 20 this year the moon's shadow falls across parts of North Africa, Europe and the Middle East .\nThe moon is slowly moving away from the Earth so there will come a time when the moon will appear to be too small to cover the sun ."}
{"article":"Kevin Pietersen has a vocal supporter in fellow former England captain Geoff Boycott as he clings to renewed hope that he might yet play international cricket again. New England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves has provided the first hint that Pietersen could resume a career which reached an apparently irrevocable full stop when he was sacked 13 months ago. Pietersen was in optimistic mood again on Monday that an unlikely reconciliation could be achieved, tweeting: 'Incredibly humbling how supportive you've all been since the news broke yesterday from Mr Colin Graves. Gonna try work this out for sure!' Kevin Pietersen has made no secret of his desire to return to the England setup but it seems unlikey . Indications in the 24 hours since Graves' BBC interview appear to have been less encouraging for the exiled 34-year-old batsman. The ECB issued a statement on Sunday, insisting 'nothing has changed' in his status and adding 'only players who are playing consistent high-quality county cricket and who are seen as a positive influence will be selected for England'. But BBC pundit Boycott has called for face-to-face discussions in which the governing body is 'fair' to Pietersen and does not 'lead him on' without a true intention to recall him as long as he plays well. He also suggested that, if key personalities such as ECB managing director Paul Downton and national selector James Whitaker disagree with Graves, they should leave their jobs. Graves stressed the pre-requisite of any conceivable progress must be a return to county cricket, something Pietersen's summer Twenty20 contracts in the Indian and Caribbean premier leagues will hardly help. New ECB chairman Colin Graves suggested over the weekend the door could still be open for Pietersen . His involvement in English domestic cricket for Surrey last summer was fleeting - exclusively in the NatWest t20 Blast - following his sacking by England. Downton has spoken on several occasions since then of the record-breaking batsman's apparent 'disengagement' with his team-mates while England were losing the final 2013\/14 Ashes Test in Sydney by 281 runs. Surrey de-registered Pietersen at the end of last season, and are not publicly inclined to reopen negotiations. Boycott has identified clear communication between Pietersen and Graves as the starting point to ensure no new stumbling blocks are created. He told the BBC: 'It says to me that Kevin needs to get a meeting with Colin Graves as soon as he can - and, preferably, with Paul Downton and James Whitaker there after he has spoken to the chairman - because he wants to be clear. New England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves wants Pietersen (right) to play county cricket . 'It's all right the chairman saying he has to play county cricket. But if he does that and gives up a lucrative IPL contract and Downton and Whitaker are still not going to pick him, that's kind of like leading him on isn't it? And that's not fair. 'It needs to be put clear to him that if he plays well in county cricket then there's going to be a genuine - and I mean the word genuine - change of heart and change of opinion that he is going to be open for selection and that they are going to put bygones to one side. 'I don't think that it is fair to ask anybody to give up an IPL contract - because that's all he has. 'He only has Twenty20 around the world.' Boycott senses Downton and Whitaker could even be expendable, if there is a difference of opinion on Pietersen between them and former Yorkshire chairman Graves. He added: 'If Whitaker and Downton can't accept a change of plan or opinion from the chairman then they have to resign, don't they? Former England captain Geoff Boycott has warned the ECB to not 'lead on' Pietersen over a possible return . 'It's simple. They have to do what the chairman tells them, or go. 'We need to listen to our chairman from Yorkshire. He is no fool. He is very quiet and a nice man - but underneath he has got some steel about him.' There was, understandably, little engagement in the Pietersen topic from former team-mate Joe Root who has more pressing issues to confront in Australia and New Zealand as England try to stay in the World Cup after three defeats in four matches. Root is tipped by many as a future England captain, however, and opinions such as his could yet be pivotal to Pietersen's chances of a recall. He made it clear Pietersen is hardly uppermost in his mind at present, but also that he has a good working relationship with the South Africa-born batsman. Kevin Pietersen (left) has recently been playing for the Melbourne Stars in Australia's Big Bash competition . 'We're in the middle of the World Cup, and there's plenty of other stuff we need to be focusing on,' said Root. 'He doesn't really enter that. I've no problems with Kev. I've not spoken to him for a while, but he seems to be doing okay.' Pietersen, meanwhile, intends to seek an audience with Graves - well aware he and his advisers must somehow try to resurrect a county career before they can think about any more glory days with England. His world-class standing means he can command a budget-busting salary, but if he finds himself in a position where he needs a county contract at all costs, he could perhaps be re-entering a buyer's market. He closed his Monday tweet with a 'peace' motif - but it will surely be a vexed process if he is to get his wish.","highlights":"Kevin Pietersen admits he'd love to play cricket for England again .\nColin Graves appointment as ECB chairman has opened the door for Pietersen to make a return if he plays county cricket .\nThe batsman would be forced to drop a Twenty20 franchise to play county .\nKevin Pietersen has not played for England since the 2013\/14 Ashes tour .\nFormer England skipper Boycott has called for face-to-face discussions ."}

{"article":"After fighting to stay cool, Steve McClaren now has a battle of greater significance. His Derby County team must arrest their alarming slump if this season is not to finish in even deeper disappointment than the last. Wolves inflicted another defeat with a determined display and have the play-offs firmly in sight. Derby were top after 33 games, 11 points ahead of Kenny Jackett\u2019s side. After a sixth match without a win the gap is just two. Derby do not look safe in fifth. Wolves are in the prowl in seventh. McClaren was furious with referee Keith Stroud\u2019s call that denied his team an opening goal. He will be angry with his defenders for the Wolves goals. Derby goalkeeper Lee Grant punches a sliced clearance into his own net to make it 2-0 to Wolves . Nouha Dicko celebrates with Scott Golbourne and Bakary Sakho after giving Wolves the lead at Molineux . Dicko fires past Lee Grant in the Derby goal just minutes after half-time to set Wolves on their way to victory . Wolves (4-4-2):\u00a0Kuszczak 7; Doherty 6.5, Batth 6, Stearman 6.5, Golbourne 6.5; Henry 6.5 (Van La Parra 68\u2019 6.5), Price 6.5, McDonald 7.5, Sako 7; Afobe 7 (Doyle 90\u2019), Dicko 7 (Edwards 65\u2019 6) Subs not used: McCarey, Ebanks-Landell, Hause, Iorfa .

Subs not used: Ward, Roos, Hanson, Thomas, Shotton, Warnock . Booked: Christie . Manager: Steve McLaren 6.5 . Referee: Keith Stroud 3 . Attendance: 27,480 . In the 69th minute goalkeeper Lee Grant elected to punch rather than catch the ball after Craig Forsyth had slashed a clearance skywards. Grant succeeded only in diverting it horribly into his own net. Forsyth was at fault earlier. Three minutes after the interval he erred in sending a clearance to Kevin McDonald, who fed the Nouha Dicko. The Mali striker dispatched his finish through the legs of two Derby defenders. The match was utterly absorbing. Derby hit the woodwork twice, Wolves once. There were shots, saves, and in the 39th minute a real shocker. Amid the end-to-end chances, Stroud intervened in entirely unnecessary fashion. Jesse Lingard slipped a pass to Darren Bent, who was tugged down by Wolves captain Danny Batth as he ran clear. In an instant Tom Ince arrived to pop the ball into the unguarded net. But Stroud had blown to award the visitors a free-kick. He compounded the error by failing to administer a card of any colour despite the foul warranting red for denying a goalscoring opportunity. The Wolves players celebrate after Grant punched the ball into his own net to make it 2-0 . Derby manager Steve McLaren shows his frustration during the Championship defeat on Friday . McClaren, sitting in the stands, ripped the headset from his ear and made his way to the touchline to remonstrate. Growing animated, he was mocked by Wolves fans. \u2018Where\u2019s your brolly gone?\u2019 they sang. Craig Bryson fired the free-kick at goal and Tomasz Kuszczak, not for the first or last time, dived to save. The Polish goalkeeper had earlier made fine stops from a Lingard piledriver and a long-ranger by Ince. Ince was targeted by Wolves fans for his England Under-21 withdrawal. \u2018Eng-ur-land,\u2019 they chanted. He nearly silenced them in the 25th minute with a curling shot that hit the bar. Wolves were more than competing. In the 27th minute a cross by Dicko was deflected to Benik Afobe whose volley was kept out by Lee Grant. Dicko sent another effort just wide. Bakary Sakho holds off the challenge of Derby County midfielder WIll Hughes . He made no mistake with his goal to send Molineux wild. Derby pressed hard in the second period and Kuszczak produced his finest save by getting his fingertips to Bryson\u2019s sweet drive, diverting the ball onto the post. Wolves hit the woodwork too, when McDonald sent Afobe clear with a long pass. The Wolves striker smacked the crossbar. Grant then gifted the hosts the clincher and Derby\u2019s race was run. Afterwards, McClaren had one thing on his mind. \u2018It\u2019s cost us the game,\u2019 he said of Stroud\u2019s decision. \u2018He will watch it again and know he is wrong.\u2019 McClaren implements a no-swear policy but admitted he breached it when trying to make sense of the officiating. He spoke to the referees assessor to air his grievance. Tomasz Kuszczak of Wolves celebrates his team's second goal against Derby on Friday night . \u2018We try not to complain too much about referees like we see in the game,\u2019 he said. \u2018But it is very difficult to keep our humility.\u2019 McClaren believes his side can \u2018absolutely\u2019 win all their remaining seven games to reassert a push for automatic promotion. A play-off place is the minimum requirement. He hopes his injured players including Chris Martin, Jeff Hendrick, and George Thorne will all be back after the international break. Jackett wants two points per match in the run-in to reach the play-offs just a season after winning League One. \u2018We\u2019re in with a really good shout of being able to take one of those three promotion places,\u2019 he said. \u2018We have potency up front and pace that disturbs defenders. \u2018When Derby beat us by five (in November), at that junction it looked like a chasm between the two clubs. Derby have been setting the benchmark for quality in the Championship. So for us to be two points behind we\u2019re delighted.\u2019","highlights":"Wolves beat Derby 2-0 at Molineux in the Championship on Friday .\nNouha Dicko opened the scoring for the hosts minutes after half-time .\nDerby keeper punched into his net to double the lead on 69 minutes .\nDerby missed the chance to go third while Wolves\u00a0claimed\u00a0to seventh ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Manchester United defender Jonny Evans and Newcastle United striker Papiss Cisse have been charged by the Football Association for allegedly spitting during an altercation in Wednesday night's Premier League game at St James' Park. In a statement, English football's governing body said the players had been charged \"in relation to an alleged breach of FA Rule E1[a] in that in or around the 38th minute of the game the two players spat at each other. \"The incidents were not seen by the match officials but [were] caught on video.\" The players have until 6pm GMT on Friday to respond to the charge, and could face six-game bans if found guilty. Both Evans and Cisse released statements the day after the incident, with Evans saying: \"I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse.\" Cisse's statement said: \"I reacted to something I found very unpleasant. Sometimes it is hard not to react, particularly in the heat of the moment. I have always tried hard to be positive a role model, especially for our young fans, and yesterday I let you down.\" Spitting at another player is considered beyond the pale by professional footballers, and former Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann, now a TV pundit, told the BBC's Match of the Day programme the incident had been \"disgusting.\" \"This is not acceptable,\" he said. \"There are kids watching. Something has to be done. The behaviour towards each other and the referee is deteriorating on a weekly basis.\" Ex-Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes said he did not believe Evans had deliberately spat at Cisse, telling BT Sport: \"Look, it's not very nice.

{"article":"London (CNN)Previously secret correspondence between Britain's Prince Charles and government officials is to be made public after a Supreme Court ruling Thursday. The Guardian newspaper had been fighting for the communications to be released since 2005. Charles is next in line to the British throne and as King would constitutionally be required to maintain strict political neutrality. Some commentators say letters to officials suggest he could be a \"meddling king,\" attempting to influence politicians. After the judgment was released Thursday, Guardian Editor-in-Chief Alan Rusbridger said the paper was \"delighted\" about the Supreme Court's decision after what he said was a \"brilliant 10-year campaign by Guardian reporter Rob Evans.\" \"The government wasted hundreds of thousands of pounds trying to cover up these letters, admitting their publication would 'seriously damage' perceptions of the Prince's political neutrality. Now they must publish them so that the public can make their own judgment,\" Rusbridger said. Max Foster, CNN's royal correspondent, says the letters are part of a broader discussion about the role of the heir to the throne. \"These were private letters, never meant for public consumption, which is why the Prince's office has resisted their release,\" he said. \"But they play into a much bigger debate about the role of monarchy. Should Charles be getting involved in politics at all when, as head of state, he'll be expected to be politically neutral? He's not in that position yet so feels he has some leeway.\" Prime Minister David Cameron said the judgment was \"disappointing\" and the government would now look at how to release the letters. \"This is about the principle that senior members of the royal family are able to express their views to government confidentially. I think most people would agree this is fair enough,\" he said. Cameron suggested the legislation might need revision in light of the decision: \"Our FOI (freedom of information) laws specifically include the option of a governmental veto, which we exercised in this case for a reason. If the legislation does not make Parliament's intentions for the veto clear enough, then we will need to make it clearer.\" The Prince's official residence, Clarence House, issued a brief statement about the decision. \"This is a matter for the government. Clarence House is disappointed the principle of privacy has not been upheld.\" The anti-monarchy group Republic welcomed the news but warned that 2010 changes to the Freedom of Information Act to remove the public interest clause put future releases at risk. \"The government must now act to end royal secrecy. Any risk to the monarchy must pale against a risk to democracy from having an activist prince acting in secret,\" CEO Graham Smith said. \"We can't have a situation where we don't know what influence Charles is having on government policy.\" In a statement issued on the eve of the decision, Smith branded the monarchy one of Britain's \"most secretive institutions.\" \"Charles clearly has his own political agenda, yet his name won't be on the ballot in May. So we all need to know what influence he is trying to exert and what impact he is having on policy.\" Evans, the Guardian reporter, had been fighting a legal battle to get the letters published since 2005 when he requested disclosure of communications between Charles and various government departments under the UK's Freedom of Information Act and environmental regulations. After the departments and the information commissioner denied his requests, Evans appealed to the Information Tribunal, which referred the matter to the Upper Tribunal. The Guardian reported in 2009 that Charles had written to Treasury, Foreign Office and Education Department ministers over the previous three years and that his aides had also written letters to government officials. \"The disclosures will fuel growing concern that the prince is continuing to interfere in political matters when many believe he should remain neutral if he wishes to become king,\" the paper said. The Upper Tribunal ruled in 2012 that many of the letters, \"advocacy correspondence,\" should be disclosed, but its decision was vetoed by Britain's attorney general, who issued a certificate overriding it. Explaining his decision, the attorney general said that in that his view, the correspondence was \"undertaken as part of The Prince of Wales' preparation for becoming King\" and contained nothing that outweighed \"strong public interest against disclosure.\" The Guardian challenged the veto in court, but three high court judges dismissed it, so Evans appealed to the Supreme Court, which on Thursday ruled that the attorney general was not entitled to issue the certificate.","highlights":"Letters from Prince Charles to officials must be released after a Supreme Court judgment .\nBritain's Guardian newspaper fought for 10 years to have the documents made public .\nClarence House and Prime Minister David Cameron call the decision disappointing ."}
{"article":"Liverpool's win over Manchester City on Sunday lifted them to within two points of the Champions League places and Brendan Rodgers' side are one of the hottest teams in Europe right now. Since the turn of the year, Liverpool - led by the form of Philippe Coutinho - have picked up 20 points from eight games at a remarkable two and a half points per game. Arsenal, with 18 points from eight games, and Chelsea, who have 14 from seven, have been the next best in the Premier League this calendar year, but Liverpool's quest for Champions League football has outstripped all their rivals.

In the top five leagues in Europe only Wolfsburg, who have won five and drawn one of their six games this year, have picked up points at a better rate. The German side have narrowed the gap to Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich since the beginning of January, but still trail the champions by eight points. With striker Bas Dost in remarkable form - with 13 goals in his eight games since January 1 - and former Chelsea midfielder Kevin De Bruyne pulling the strings behind him, Wolfsburg now look nailed on for a Champions League spot. In fact, qualification for Europe's biggest competition links all of the top form teams, with few of 2015's best performers actually challenging for the title in the top leagues around the continent.

In Spain, Valencia's excellent run of just one defeat and one draw in nine games this year has lifted them to within a point of Atletico Madrid in third place, though they are still eight points short of Real Madrid at the top of the table. The most remarkable upsurge in form comes from Caen, who have picked up 19 points from eight games, having only earned 15 from their  19 matches in the first half of the season. The run has seen them earn a 2-2 draw against PSG and beat Marseille 3-2 having trailed 2-0 in both games.

On-loan Argentine foward Emiliano Sala, signed from Bordeaux at the end of January, has scored four times in the last three games as Caen have climbed from bottom of the league on New Year's Day to a comfortable mid-table spot, five points above the drop zone. Only in Italy have the team top of the league started 2015 with the best form. Juventus have earned 19 points from nine games - the same number as city-rivals Torino - to stretch their lead over Roma at the top of Serie A to nine points. The top two sides in Italy met on Monday night when they played out a 1-1 draw that keeps Juve on course for a fourth straight Scudetto.

{"article":"Graphic cell phone footage has emerged of brutal attack on a school girl that took place in Brooklyn after class on Monday afternoon. The three minute clip shows an unfair fight that begins with a small girl in a light blue hoodie being set upon by at least four other students. As the girl is mercilessly pummelled by the gang her blonde hair extensions are ripped from her head as she is repeatedly punched and kicked. Graphic cell phone footage has emerged of brutal attack on a school girl that took place in Brooklyn after class on Monday afternoon . The vicious fight is cheered on by dozens of other youths who jockey for a good view of the senseless violence. The video, posted on Facebook, captures the afternoon brawl at a McDonald\u2019s  near Erasmus Hall High School on Flatbush Avenue. Despite being outnumbered, the small girl gives as good as she gets and at one point she pulls a black hoodie off one of her attackers to reveal a bra. Towards the end of the video - which has been shared more than 19,000 times and viewed more than 740,000 - the smaller girl is left cowering under a table. Finally an adult appears and attempts to break up the fight, but the taller attacker now stripped down to her bra\u00a0kicks and stomps on her victim's head, calling her a 'bitch,' before storming off. Bystanders can be heard saying, 'She\u2019s dead,' and, 'You murdered her.' One of the main protagonists in the fight is left stripped to her bra, while the girl being picked on is so weak at the end that she collapses on a bench . A few students then intervene, pick the small girl up and sit her on a nearby bench. Immediately she collapses and so the students help her to lie down. NYPD have reviewed the video, but there is very little they can do because it doesn\u2019t appear that anyone has filed a complaint, reports the New York Daily News. Brooklyn community activist Tony Herbert hopes the victim comes forward and is demanding her assailants be arrested. 'The message has to be sent very clearly, that this kind of violence will not be tolerated whether in a mall or in restaurants and those involved should turn themselves in to authorities immediately so as to face the consequences of their violent actions,' he said. Anyone with information about the fight is asked to call Crime Stoppers on 1-800-577-TIPS.

{"article":"(CNN)For years, Native Americans have called on Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder to change the team's name. It's a dictionary-defined racial slur that's dehumanizing to Native Americans. And, in my view, that outweighs the arguments of Redskins advocates who defend the name as a symbol of team pride. But what about the thousands of high schools across the United States that have the name as its mascot? Where do they fit in the debate? Once you factor in freedom of speech, how should one approach this issue? Recently, in upstate New York, the Lancaster Central District School Board unanimously voted to retire its high school's mascot and moniker -- the \"Redskins.\" The board called the mascot \"a symbol of ethnic stereotyping\" and said the school \"cannot continue practices which are offensive and hurtful to others\" -- namely Native Americans. Some students opposed the board's decision citing school legacy and tradition. A group of Lancaster High students hosted a walk out in protest with many carrying placards reading, \"Redskins Pride\" and \"Once a Redskin, Always a Redskin.\" Coincidentally, around the same time in Delaware, the Conrad Schools of Science announced it will begin to take steps to drop its \"Redskins\" mascot before the beginning of the 2015-16 school year. Local school districts are responding to the growing chorus of voices who oppose antiquated Native American mascots. Furthermore, there's research that shows Indian mascots and monikers harm the mental health of Native American youths. According to one study, Native American students are reported to have low self-esteem and a suppressed sense of self-worth as a consequence of such images and language. Other research shows how all ethnic groups are hurt by poor representations of Native Americans. People \"are more likely to negatively stereotype other ethnic groups as well,\" according to Wendy Quinton, clinical assistant professor of psychology at the University at Buffalo. What the Conrad Schools of Science and the Lancaster school board decisions represent for Native Americans are hope -- for us and our kids -- that broader awareness is changing perspectives and that hurtful stereotypical nicknames should not have to be tolerated by any ethnic group. Still, there's the issue of free speech. Many have made the argument that Native Americans like me are trampling on the First Amendment when we call for the Washington football team to change its name. Even the ACLU has chimed in on the matter. On March 6, the organization said in a blog it does not support the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's decision to cancel federal trademark protection of the Washington football team's use of the word \"redskins.\" In June of last year, the USPTO had repealed six of the team's seven trademarks, finding the r-word is \"disparaging to Native Americans.\" Although the ACLU agrees the team name is \"offensive and perpetuates racism against Native Americans,\" it cannot support what it refers to as language policing. \"... Because the First Amendment protects against government interference in private speech,\" staff attorney Esha Bhandari wrote. \"It isn't government's role to pick and choose which viewpoints are acceptable and which are not.\" Here's the thing, folks -- no one has a First Amendment right to federal trademark protection. Tara Houska, a tribal rights attorney in Washington, said, \"Freedom of speech is a fundamental right. In contrast, federal trademark protection is a privilege that one applies for at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\" I think the ACLU is confusing rights with privileges. The U.S. government isn't telling the Washington football team it can't use the word. According to the USPTO, Snyder and his ilk can keep using the team name -- he just won't have federal trademark protection. Last month, Democratic Rep. Mike Honda of California filed a bill that would ban existing and future teams that use the word from receiving federal trademark protection. He told me he's \"disappointed\" that the ACLU would defend the Washington team, which he refers to as \"a multi-billion dollar company profiting off a racial slur.\" \"The First Amendment is not the issue here -- no one, including the football team, would be prohibited from using the name,\" he wrote in an email. \"The team would only lose their exclusive rights to it.\" And in the case of Lancaster High Schools, the government didn't step in -- the decision to retire the name was made by conscientious objectors in the community. Let's look at the issue from another angle. What do we do as responsible adults when we learn a habit or tradition is adversely affecting our children? We do everything we can to fix the problem. What we do not do is make excuses so we can continue the terrible habit. As the late Maya Angelou so aptly put it, \"Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.\" America needs to do better as a whole with regard to Native Americans. This isn't just about Indian mascots. This isn't just about offensive racial slurs. This is about the dehumanization of Native Americans. And if history has shown us anything, it's that when one group dehumanizes another, bad things happen. Honda's bill, the USPTO's repeal and the Lancaster school board's decision are not examples of anti-free speech madness. They are acting like responsible adults in defense of children who are at risk. And as for me, I'll protect children first before I protect anyone's right to harm them.","highlights":"Recently, schools are deciding to retire the term 'redskins' for their mascots .\nSimon Moya-Smith: It's a dictionary-defined racial slur that's dehumanizing to Native Americans ."}
{"article":"Southampton have jetted off to Switzerland for a break ahead of what James Ward-Prowse believes are the 10 biggest matches in the club's history. Saints' late, and somewhat fortuitous, victory against Crystal Palace on Tuesday evening got them back to winning way after their remarkable season started to go off kilter. The latest in a line of disjointed displays looked set to cost Ronald Koeman's men, only for Sadio Mane to strike late on to secure a 1-0 win which moved them back to within a point of the top-four. James Ward-Prowse (front) uploaded an image to Instagram of the Southampton team on the plane . Sadio Mane (centre) scores the decisive goal as Southampton beat Crystal Palace 1-0 on Tuesday . Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has taken the squad to Switzerland fora team break . It means Champions League qualification remains a realistic - and scarcely-believable - prospect for Saints, whose players flew to Switzerland on Wednesday for a break ahead of what Ward-Prowse knows is a crunch period. 'I think it will be great to just have a good time, the pressure of the Premier League is massive, especially where we are in the table,' the midfielder said. 'It's good to get away, put our feet up and have a bit of a laugh with the group. It should be a good bit of fun and then we'll move on from there . 'These next 10 games are probably the biggest in the club's history and we're determined as a group of players to make history for the club. 'We want to get us to the biggest stage in the world where we feel we belong with the best teams and best players in the world.' Next up for Southampton is the unenviable task of a trip to Chelsea on March 15 - a match Ward-Prowse will hope to be starting after his telling impact against Palace. The England Under 21 midfielder was brought on in a bid to inject some fresh impetus into Saints' toiling attack and had the desired impact, producing the shot which led to Mane clipping home. 'We reflected on the win in the changing room and we believe it's going to be a pivotal three points come the end of the season,' Ward-Prowse told Southampton's official YouTube channel . 'We haven't been on the best of runs lately and it's great to obviously get the three points and move forward. You could feel the whole stadium was pleased. 'It wasn't a pretty performance, not a vintage Southampton display, but we dug deep, the fans got behind us and I think we showed great character.' Southampton's displays have been inconsistent lately but Mane's goal keeps  their Champions League hopes . Ward-Prowse believes the final 10 league games of the season are the biggest in Southampton's history . While Ward-Prowse deserved credit for the run and shot that led to Mane's goal, it would not have got that far had Julian Speroni dealt with the initial attempt. The long-serving Palace goalkeeper could only parry Ward-Prowse's shot into the Senegal winger's path, but defender Scott Dann stood up for his team-mate after the costly mistake. 'You can't just point the finger at Jules,' he said. 'He has kept us in games at times this season and he will carry on making important saves for us. Scott Dann refused to criticise goalkeeper Julian Speroni for spilling the ball into the path of Mane for the goal . 'Jules said he should have done better but these things happen and we should have reacted better. 'He is a great goalkeeper and has done really well for us. He made a couple of good saves last night and made some good decisions coming out when they played balls through. 'These things happen but we'll stick together as a team.'","highlights":"Southampton have 10 days off before their next game against Chelsea .\nThey beat Crystal Palace 1-0 on Tuesday to move a point off the top four .\nThe squad are heading to Switzerland for a team break before the run-in ."}
{"article":"Andy Murray responded to an earsplitting welcome from his adoring Scottish crowd to put Great Britain 1-0 up in their Davis Cup first round against the United States. In front of a packed 7,700 crowd at a Union Jack-bedecked Emirates Arena in Glasgow he recovered from a brief lull to eventually crush American number two Donald Young 6-1 6-1 4-6 6-2 in just under two hours.

States like Illinois, Hawaii, Minnesota and New York joined the fold voluntarily, while others were ordered by state or federal judges to offer and recognize the unions.

{"article":"Bafetimbi Gomis was given a clean bill of health on Thursday after revealing his shocking mid-game collapse was caused by the stress of his father\u2019s ill health. The Frenchman was discharged from hospital in London in the morning having fainted eight minutes into Swansea\u2019s 3-2 defeat against Tottenham at White Hart Lane. There were distressing echoes of Fabrice Muamba\u2019s collapse at the same ground three years ago, with Spurs\u2019 substitute goalkeeper Brad Friedel admitting he \u2018feared the worst\u2019 as he watched the striker slump to the ground. Bafetimbi Gomis lies face down on the pitch after collapsing during  Swansea's game with Tottenham . Medical staff attended to the France international for four minutes before he regained consciousness . Concerned Tottenham players look on as the Swansea forward is attended to my medical staff . But hospital tests through the night have found no deeper cause for concern beyond the 29-year-old\u2019s vasovagal condition, which the Welsh club insist they have been aware of since before they signed the player from Lyon last summer. A senior club source told Sportsmail that knowledge of at least three previous episodes involving Gomis in France meant they were \u2018extra rigorous\u2019 in testing him during his medical and cardiology exams. A source close to the player confirmed those tests took place in a specialist facility in Cardiff ahead of Gomis\u2019s Bosman move to south Wales. The Frenchman tweeted to insist he was feeling better, claiming he fainted because of the anxiety caused by his father\u2019s illness. He said: \u2018I wanted to reassure you concerning my health. It actually looks much scarier than it is physically dangerous, and I am feeling well now. Gomis, who has a history of blacking out, is taken off the field on a stretcher at White Hart Lane . Tottenham midfielder Nabil Bentaleb (right) holds his head in his hands as Gomis is taken off on a stretcher . Players from both sides appear shocked as referee Michael Oliver prepares to restart the game . \u2018I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father\u2019s health, which requires me to go back and forth from France. \u2018I was disappointed that I couldn\u2019t help my team tonight (Wednesday), but now everything is back in order. I also want to thank everyone for their support and get well messages.\u2019 The striker will not return to training until Tuesday, though the time off was agreed for the whole squad ahead of Wednesday\u2019s incident, with Swansea not playing again until Monday week\u2019s clash against Liverpool. He is expected to return to France imminently. Club officials were adamant on Wednesday night that Gomis has suffered no previous issues with fainting since his arrival at the Liberty Stadium, though the dressing room had been made aware of a condition that is understood to have first affected the striker when he was 14. A vasovagal syncope, which is what Bafetimbi Gomis suffered on Wednesday night, is caused by a sudden decrease in blood pressure or heart-rate, triggered by emotional or physical factors. Reduced blood flow to the brain makes a person faint. It can be prompted by extreme exertion or anxiety. On the physical side, there are numerous tests that can be done when a player has a medical and it appears Swansea knew all about Gomis\u2019s history. They will have checked the flow through his blood vessels under exercise stress, though emotional triggers are harder to quantify. It is a rare condition for a professional sportsman and is more common in older people. It is not something I have encountered in any other footballer. Thankfully, it is not an especially dangerous condition in isolation. The risks are low beyond what happens when you fall. You could hit your head or suffer trauma damage to another part of the body on landing. Often there is a stimulus that the person will recognise and they can act, by sitting down. Most sufferers feel fine in a matter of moments. Gomis has a history of fainting and can be seen here collapsing during France national team training in 2009 . It has been reported in France that Gomis previously fainted during a friendly for Lyon against Deportivo La Coruna in August 2009, before this episode in training . Gomis is helped by French goalkeeper Cedric Carrasso after the collapse in Guincamp . The French striker is understood to have resumed playing within 10 to 15 minutes of the episode . It has been reported in France that he previously fainted during a friendly for Lyon against Deportivo La Coruna in August 2009, before it happened again in training for the France national team two months later. On each occasion he is understood to have resumed playing within 10 to 15 minutes of the episode. Gomis is believed to have collapsed a third time in a Ligue 1 match for Lyon against Monaco in August 2010. Such episodes are caused by low blood pressure to the brain, usually brought on by emotional or physical distress. Medical experts told Sportsmail that the main risks associated with the condition would come from falling, though Swansea claim Gomis is able to detect when a problem occurring and acts accordingly. AUGUST 2, 2009 - LYON 2-2 DEPORTIVO . WHAT HAPPENED? In one of his first games for Lyon, Gomis both scores and faints in a pre-season friendly. However his new club are not overly concerned. WHAT HAPPENED NEXT? Club doctor Emmanuel Ohrant said: \u2018Since 14-years-old, Bafe has been the subject of such vasovagal episodes, comparable to a drop in blood pressure. At St Etienne, he used to faint. We got his whole medical file, and I can testify very exhaustive medical examinations have been . OCTOBER 7, 2009 - FRANCE TRAINING . WHAT HAPPENED?

The striker was seen on the ground with his eyes rolled back before club doctor Emmanuel Orhant intervened. WHAT HAPPENED NEXT? However, Gomis quickly regained consciousness and continued playing until he was subbed off in the 76th minute. He later said: \u2018I had an [incident] early in the game. I often do early in the season. I have immediately felt good after that. I think it was related to stress.'

Friedel was in the stands when Muamba collapsed with a cardiac arrest and said: \u2018Anyone who was at that game probably thought the worst immediately. 'It's not normal for someone to be standing there and collapse and you know it's going to be something serious. 'But after a minute or so the word got back, so that's why you didn't see the panic on the players' faces because everyone knew he was all right.

{"article":"Kevin Pietersen is willing to give up his Indian Premier League contract to play county cricket in an attempt to make an extraordinary return to the England side. In what would be the first step of a very long journey back to international cricket, the exiled star is ready to accept the challenge of new ECB chairman Colin Graves and try to fight his way back to the England side. Graves had said in a BBC interview last month that Pietersen would have to be playing regular county cricket if he was to have any chance of being considered by the a regime which is making sweeping changes at the ECB. Kevin Pietersen is willing to turn his back on the Indian Premier League in order to represent England . Pietersen, pictured in 2008, would have to repair his relationship with England boss Peter Moores . The governing body were then quick to emphasise that nothing had changed in their stance and they would only pick those who were not only performing well in county cricket but who were \u2018a positive influence on the England side.\u2019 Pietersen was picked up relatively cheaply by the Hyderabad Sunrisers of the IPL this year in a deal worth around \u00a3200,000 making it less expensive for him to throw in his lot with an as yet unnamed county and try to call Graves bluff. Yet a comeback, approaching 35, would still be remarkable. England\u2019s need is greatest in one-day cricket, the format of the game Pietersen least enjoyed during his later years with England, and the wounds from his bitter sacking from England are still raw. He reopened many with his bitter book. If he came back it would be hard to see how he could work with senior players like Alastair Cook, Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson as well as coach Peter Moores, who he tried to force out in 2009, managing director Paul Downton, who sacked him last year, and national selector James Whitaker, who said in December that Pietersen would never play for England again. For Pietersen to come back now a lot of people would have to either depart or rebuild some seriously broken bridges.

{"article":"(HLN)Nick Gordon, romantic partner of Bobbi Kristina Brown, sat down recently with Dr. Phil McGraw for his first on-camera interview since Whitney Houston's daughter was rushed to the hospital in January after being found face down in her bathtub. The interview aired Wednesday on NBC. When his team traveled to Atlanta and initially approached Gordon about the interview, Dr. Phil says they found him in a hysterical state. Video showed an intoxicated Gordon crying and mumbling about missing Krissy, as Brown's family calls her. Brown was found unresponsive in her Roswell, Georgia, home on January 31 and remains hospitalized. Authorities say they're approaching her case as a criminal investigation. See more: Who's who: Bobbi Kristina's small family circle . Dr. Phil first spoke with Nick Gordon's mother, Michelle Gordon, who said her son had admitted to her his desire to take his own life. Even though she's never known him to abuse drugs or alcohol in the past, she said she has recently spoken to her son on the phone when he appeared to be drunk or high. \"He has blamed himself for [Krissy] being in the condition that she's in, he's torn up by that,\" Michelle Gordon told Dr. Phil. \"He's dealing with it by drinking. I've begged him to stop.\" She said repeatedly that Nick Gordon is at a breaking point and that he's even attempted to kill himself by taking Xanax and Unisom. \"Left to his own devices, he'll be dead inside a week,\" Dr. Phil told her. That's when Dr. Phil went up to Nick Gordon's hotel room to persuade him that he needs an intervention. On the way back to the interview room, Gordon admitted that he'd had two shots of alcohol earlier that morning and later started crying in the elevator while showing Dr. Phil his new tattoo: Bobbi Kristina's name on his forearm.

Gordon kept switching from crying in his mother's arms, to laughing at Dr. Phil's multiple requests to go to rehab, to agreeing that he needs to get sober in order to help Krissy. He admitted to drinking too much and taking too many pills, only to say he's fine and doesn't care about rehab later in the interview. He told Dr. Phil he hasn't been sleeping and has been waking up in the middle of the night, praying for Krissy.

{"article":"(CNN)A 20-year-old man from the St. Louis area has been arrested in connection with the shooting of two police officers during last week's protests in Ferguson, Missouri, a prosecutor said Sunday. Jeffrey Williams was arrested late Saturday, and he has been charged with two counts of first-degree assault, a count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal activity, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch said at a news conference in Clayton. \"The demonstrations were pretty much over (when the officers were shot). People were leaving, and that's when this happened,\" he said, describing Williams as a demonstrator who had taken part in protests on numerous occasions. At the time of his arrest, Williams was on probation for receiving stolen property, and McCulloch said he believed Williams had an outstanding warrant after not reporting to his probation officer for several months. The prosecutor repeatedly thanked the public for the information that led to the arrest. He also said that, because of the public's assistance in the case, police were able to serve a search warrant on Williams' residence where they seized a .40-caliber handgun, \"which has been tied to the shell casings that were recovered\" at the scene of the shooting. Williams is being held on a cash-only $300,000 bond, McCulloch said, adding that it's possible Williams could face more charges and that others could be charged in the case. One element of the case that authorities have yet to sort out is intent, McCulloch said, adding that Williams has acknowledged firing the shots but has said he wasn't aiming at the police officers. Investigators are not sure they \"buy\" Williams' claim that he opened fire after a dispute with other individuals, McCulloch said, but he didn't rule it out. \"It's possible he was firing at someone else,\" he said, urging any other witnesses with information to come forward. Bishop Derrick Robinson, an area organizer, challenged the idea that Williams was a well-known protester. \"I asked him (Williams) why would he say that he was a protester because it makes us look bad -- because so many things that we've done to rebuild our community. It sets us like five steps back to say that it was a protester who did it, but he admitted to me that he'd never protested,\" said Robinson, who spoke to Williams on Sunday. Robinson added: \"We won't allow this to distract us from our mission, and from purpose, because we will continue to fight.\" The shootings occurred Wednesday night. The shots rang out from a hill overlooking the city's police station shortly after midnight Wednesday, at the end of a protest against the Ferguson Police Department, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at the time. Officers saw \"muzzle flashes ... about 125 yards away,\" Belmar said. \"We could have buried two police officers,\" Belmar told reporters last week. \"I feel very confident that whoever did this ... came there for whatever nefarious reason that it was.\" Public donations poured in to be used toward a reward to find the gunman and any accomplices, Belmar said. Authorities offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of person or persons responsible for the gunfire upon the two officers, according to the St. Louis Regional CrimeStoppers website. McCulloch said the tipster whose information led to Williams' arrest is eligible to receive the reward. He declined to provide any information on the tipster or the nature of the tip. Protesters said they had nothing to do with the shooting, saying the demonstrators believe in nonviolence. \"As the protest was dying down, someone, somewhere got violent. Now who they were and what group they were affiliated with, we don't know,\" said Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman. \"In no way are they representative of the thousands of people ... who have been protesting.\" Belmar believes someone targeted the police, who have faced heated criticism for months, he said. \"These police officers were standing there, and they were shot just because they were police officers,\" he said. The department has been under fire since one of its officers, Darren Wilson, shot and killed African-American teen Michael Brown in August, and more recently since a scathing U.S. Department of Justice report documented a pattern of racial discrimination. Police Chief Thomas Jackson resigned Wednesday. \"We are actively addressing the issues that have raised concerns of fairness and fair treatment. We support peaceful protesting.

{"article":"(CNN)Since Friday, social media debates such as #thedress were silenced. There was more sobering news. Leonard Nimoy, \"Star Trek's\" beloved Mr. Spock, had died. His co-stars, fellow celebrities and fans reacted with heartfelt tributes from around the world and all the way to space, where astronaut Terry W. Wirts flashed a Vulcan salute aboard the International Space Station. As the weekend went on, billboards from the company Outfront Media (formerly CBS, owners of \"Star Trek\") showed up around Atlanta. Longtime friend and co-star William Shatner remembered Nimoy \"like a brother.\" George Takei wrote, \"Today, the world lost a great man, and I lost a great friend. We return you now to the stars, Leonard.\" And Zachary Quinto, who played Spock in the recent \"Star Trek\" movie reboots, said, \"my heart is broken.\" The hashtag #LLAP, which stands for \"Live long and prosper\" and which Nimoy used to sign his tweets,  was trending across several social media platforms after the news of his death. The outpouring on Twitter and elsewhere left no doubt about Nimoy's indelible mark on pop culture. Nimoy's career also inspired some of the most brilliant minds in space and science. NASA posted a 1979 photo of Nimoy and the \"Star Trek\" cast -- some sporting '70s leisure suits -- visiting the space shuttle Enterprise. And then there were the ordinary fans -- Trekkies, aspiring actors and science geeks who related to Nimoy's brainy Spock character -- who posted personal messages and remembrances. Nimoy in 2010: \"I feel very fulfilled\" with my work . Paul Roth, 39, chief information officer at Chesapeake Systems in Baltimore, posted a teary-eyed photo using the #LLAP hashtag. \"Leonard Nimoy showed a young, nerdy, bullied me that not only could science be important and valued, but it could literally save entire ships, planets, and galaxies of lives,\" he said. \"As I grew up, he taught me that reason could be tempered with humor. That learned adults still had more to learn. That feminism and opposing prejudice was vital. And that there is no age too late to reinvent yourself.\" Neil Macdonald from Widnes in the United Kingdom wrote on Instagram: \"I have been and always shall be your friend.\" And, Molly Desormeaux, an acting student in Montreal, Quebec, said: \"Leonard Nemoy is one of the reasons why I still believe that acting can change peoples' lives.\" Nimoy: \"Fringe\" cast impressed me the most . We'll give Nimoy himself the last word. The actor, filmmaker and author, who was an active user of Twitter up until his death, shared a final thought Monday that exemplifies the fleetingness and beauty of life.

{"article":"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)A coalition of Middle Eastern forces continued pounding rebel targets in Yemen from the air on Friday, the second day of a campaign aimed at the Houthi group. While it was hard to immediately determine the extent of the damage and destruction, the resounding sounds of huge explosions heard around Sanaa on Friday night suggested that the Saudi-led strikes were taking a toll. The strikes' target is Houthi rebels, a Shiite Muslim minority group that has taken over the capital and, on Wednesday, captured key parts of the Yemeni port city of Aden. Aden was where President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi had moved because of the rebel advance. Hadi has since left Yemen, and on Friday he'd arrived in Egypt for a summit of Arab League representatives. Many nations in the Arab League are now participating in the armed effort against the Houthis and presumably to return Hadi to Yemen as its leader. While he's not in Yemen, the fierce fighting there continues. Not surprisingly, the Houthis are bearing the brunt of the bloodshed -- and not just in Sanaa. That includes at least 10 killed in the northwestern province of Saada, home to the Houthi's leader Abdul Malik Al Houthi, Houthi commanders said. More than a dozen more people were wounded, as 15 locations saw airstrikes. Five Houthis died were hurt in an attack by fighters loyal to Hadi on a Houthi post about 6 miles (10 kilometers) outside Al Anad airbase, two security officials in Lahj province said. That's where U.S. Special Operations Forces involved in fighting al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula had been based as recently as this month. Hadi has also ordered the closure of all Houthi-controlled media -- including Yemen TV and Saba TV. The Houthis, though, responded by raiding two TV channels and the prominent Al Masdar newspaper. Al Jazeera's office in Sanaa was also targeted, with Houthis looting security cameras and damaging equipment, the Qatar-based network said. The nations stepping into Yemen's civil war are predominantly Sunni Muslim, and they are working to rescue a government that has strong Sunni support. The Houthis are allied with majority Shiite Iran. Saudi Arabia, the largest contingent in the intervention dubbed al-Hazm Storm, considers the Houthis to be proxies for the Shiite government of Iran and fear another Shiite-dominated state in the region. \"What they do not want is an Iranian-run state on their southern border,\" CNN military analyst Lt. Col. Rick Francona said of the Saudis. The kingdom says Hadi, who is out of the country, pleaded for military intervention in a letter. \"I ask you, based on the principle of self-defense in Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, and on the basis of the Charter of the Arab League and the treaty of joint Arab defense, to provide instant support by all necessary means, including military intervention to protect Yemen and its people from continuous Houthi aggression,\" read the letter, which was posted by Saudi Arabia's Foreign Ministry. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Thursday that the United States commends the military action and is supporting it through intelligence sharing, targeting assistance and logistical support, a senior State Department official said. The other nations participating in the military action are the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Jordan, Morocco, Sudan and Egypt, a Saudi adviser has said. The adviser also included Pakistan, saying its military was offering naval support. But on Friday, that country's Defense Ministry said it had only vowed to defend Saudi Arabia, according to a local media report. Saudi Arabia and Egypt have spoken about the possibility of sending ground troops. Saudi Arabia has blockaded the Houthis, effectively cutting off their supply lines. By Thursday afternoon, the Saudis controlled Yemeni airspace, the adviser said, and the military threatened to destroy any naval ships trying to enter Yemeni ports. Supreme leader Al Houthi spoke live Thursday night in Yemen on al-Masirah TV, saying, \"If any army tries to invade our country, we will prove that Yemen will be a grave for those who invade us.\" Iran denounced the military intervention. Marzieh Afkham, a spokeswoman for the country's Foreign Ministry, said the operation will throw an already complicated situation into further turmoil and disrupt chances at a peaceful resolution to Yemen's months-long internal strife. It also won't help a region already facing terrorist threats from groups like ISIS and al Qaeda, she said. \"This is a dangerous action against international responsibilities to respect countries' national sovereignty,\" Afkham said, according to a report in Iran's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. At least one major player in Yemen besides the Houthis -- the General People's Congress, which is the party of longtime leader Ali Abdullah Saleh -- thinks the Saudis and their partners should stay out. The GPC says the airstrikes have already led to civilian casualties. The best way to stop the bloodshed is to bring everyone to the negotiating table, the group said. Opinion: Why Yemen has come undone . Journalist Hakim Almasmari reported from Yemen, and CNN's Greg Botelho and Ben Brumfield wrote this story from Atlanta.

{"article":"(CNN)A volcano in Russia led to the cancellation of flights in Alaska over the weekend. \"We canceled two roundtrip flights between Anchorage and Bethel, and Anchorage and Nome after an advisory of low visibility,\"  Alaska Airlines  spokeswoman Halley Knigge said. Ash from Russia's Shiveluch volcano was the culprit behind the flight disruptions Saturday,  said Jeff Freymueller, a scientist at  the Alaska Volcano Observatory. The volcano erupted Friday, shooting ash into the atmosphere some 30,000 feet.  Winds blew the ash cloud across the Bering Sea and into western Alaska, Freymueller said. Shiveluch, which has been erupting consistently, caused a similar incident in January, he said. The airline will only operate flights when it's safe to do so and will not fly into areas of reported ash. Alaska Airlines was uncertain if additional flights would be canceled, but said it's monitoring the situation.

{"article":"(CNN)Organized labor is up in arms about President Barack Obama's effort to obtain fast-track authority to finalize a free trade agreement in the Asia Pacific that involves 11 nations. The agreement, union leaders argue, threatens to take even more jobs away from Americans. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka sent a clear message to members of Congress, warning, \"There is such a dramatic impact on the standard of living and lowering of wages and a loss of jobs -- this will have a major impact, and then we will not forget this vote for a long time.\" The AFL-CIO announced that it would withhold donations to political action committees until this controversy cleared up. The tension between organized labor and Obama is not new. The struggles have been going on since 2009 when the President allowed the Employee Free Choice Act to wither in Congress. The act would require that a union be deemed as legitimate when it had the support of a majority of employees and imposed tough penalties on employers who tried to punish workers from forming unions. The President avoided making any strong appeals for the bill, though it was greatly desired by labor organizations as a way to increase membership. When Democrats chose Charlotte, North Carolina, for their 2012 political convention -- a city not friendly to labor -- unions were livid. \"There is broad frustration with the party and all elected officials,\" one labor leader said, \"broad frustration with the lack of a union agenda.\" Even though unions were crucial to administration victories such as the Affordable Care Act, President Obama has often been extremely tepid when it comes to the rights of unions. Organized labor has not been that surprised. The truth is that unions have been on the defense against Democratic presidents for decades. In the 1970s, President Jimmy Carter treated unions like one more special interest in Washington that needed to be brought down while President Bill Clinton demonstrated lukewarm support to these organizations as he aggressively pursued global free trade policies that labor opposed. \"It will cost jobs,\" warned Michigan Democrat David Bonior said of the North American Free Trade Agreement that Clinton endorsed. \"It will drive down our standard of living. If we don't stand up for the working people in this country, who is going to?\" In the past few decades, many Democratic politicians no longer believed that organized labor was a major player within their party, as they had been during the creation of the New Deal and Great Society. As organized labor became a smaller part of the American workforce, Democratic politicians were not as determined to court their vote. A larger number of Democrats since the 1970s have been elected by upper middle class suburban constituencies in which unions are not a big presence. These voters have been more concerned in a style of liberalism that revolves around quality of life issues, such as environmental regulation, than they are with middle class jobs. Many Democrats leaders embraced a vision of economic policy that centered on deregulation and free markets. New voices that came into the Democratic Party after the 1960s wanted to challenge Republicans by offering a more centrist vision of economic policy. The opportunities for Democrats to embrace a more pro-union agenda have only intensified with the fierce assault taking place among conservatives. The Koch brothers have unleashed fierce financial assault against unions. Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin and potential Republican presidential candidate, has stripped away the power of public unions and signed a right to work law that barred unions from collecting dues from employees who weren't in unions. Unions are under assault, and the movement is looking for help. Democrats, and some Republicans, often talk about needing to deal with the problem of economic inequality. Much of the talk is often vague and offers little in the way to real solutions. Shoring up the strength of unions is one area where the government can help protect jobs for middle class Americans. Without strong unions, the battle against economic inequality and insecurity will never really get started. As George Gresham, the president of United Health Care Workers East wrote in The New York Times, \"By defunding unions and weakening union members via 'right to work' laws, corporations and those that do their bidding remove workers' primary means of raising wages, securing pensions and improving workers conditions. Workers' main vehicle for advancing themselves and their communities is jeopardized.\" Democrats need to listen to what the AFL-CIO is saying. They need to push back against President Obama, even if this creates political opportunities for Republicans, so that the party does not abandon what has been at the heart and soul of their agenda. As Democrats continually watch Republicans outdo them in terms of organization and pursuit, they need to look to labor more as an ally than an enemy in the battle for the White House and Congress in the coming years.","highlights":"President Obama wants to obtain fast-track authority to finalize a free trade agreement in the Asia Pacific .\nJulian Zelizer: Organized labor is right to worry that this would take away more jobs from Americans ."}
{"article":"Formula One breathed a sigh of relief in the sunny early Saturday morning at Melbourne when Sauber's former Dutch driver Giedo van der Garde abandoned his legal action against the team. He had been suing them for dropping him despite having a contract to race for them this season, starting with Sunday's Australian Grand Prix. Courts in Melbourne found in his favour, saying he had a right to drive. However, he has not got a super-licence, so could not. Giedo van der Garde has decided to drop his case against former side Sauber after settling out of court . Marcus Ericsson (left) and Felipe Nasr (right) will race for Sauber in the absence of Van der Garde . This brought about an impasse: Sauber would be in contempt of court if they left him out. But they could not put him in according to the FIA rules. Heads we knocked together over Friday night and Van der Garde settled out of court. Van der Garde wrote on Facebook: 'With respect to the interest of motorsport, and F1 in particular, I have decided to give up my legal rights to race this weekend at the Melbourne Grand Prix. 'As I am a passionate race driver this decision has been very difficult for me. 'However I also wish to respect the interest of the FIA, Sauber Motorsport, as well as Nasr and Ericsson.' Crucially, Van der Garde has made clear further negotiations need to take place, however, before the matter can finally be closed. The 29-year-old added: 'My management will continue talks with Sauber early next week to find a mutually acceptable solution for the current situation that has now arisen. 'I am confident such solution will be found and I will inform the media once done.' Van der Garde dropped the case against Sauber out of respect to 'motorsport, and F1 in particular' Marcus\u00a0Ericssson and Felipe Nasr will race for them in his place. Both were named on Sauber's race entry and took part in second practice on Friday, having sat out of the first session while the lawyers argued. With three valid driver contracts and only two race seats available, Sauber and Kaltenborn had found themselves mired in controversy. Given Sauber's financial struggles last year, when approached by two drivers in Ericsson and Nasr who could offer considerable sums of money in sponsorship, both the Swede and Brazilian were signed. But with Van der Garde on contract, and despite also having paid up front - albeit a figure less than that of Ericsson and Nasr - the battle became legal. It remains to be seen what 'mutually acceptable solution' can now be ironed out between the two parties. Whatever the outcome, under-pressure team principal Monisha Kaltenborn, a trained lawyer, has emerged from the sorry mess in a poor light. Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn insists she will not resign from her role despite the recent saga . At the circuit on Friday, while unable to talk about the case as it remained ongoing, she did insist however she remained competent to carry on with her role as team boss. 'I don't see it (the case) having any effect,' Kaltenborn said. 'We have a very clear view of what we did. We took action after thinking about it for a while. 'For us that was very clear, but the outcome is different.' Pressed on whether she had considered resigning, Kaltenborn added: 'I've not considered that. 'This whole matter does not have any effect on the way we work, the way the team works.' Kaltenborn did concede, however, the past week had damaged morale given the team's name had been dragged through the courts. 'It's had a very negative impact on the team because the situation was, for a while, unclear,' she added. 'We now have certain actions taken against the team, and we are acting accordingly.'","highlights":"Giedo van der Garde was planning to sue former side Sauber .\nSauber dropped Van der Garde despite having contract to race .\nThe Dutchman and Sauber have decided to settle out of court .\nUnder-fire team principal Monisha Kaltenborn insists she will not resign ."}

{"article":"New York (CNN)A federal jury Wednesday found Abid Naseer guilty of plotting with al Qaeda to bomb a shopping center in 2009 in Manchester, England, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York said. Naseer, 28, was convicted on three criminal violations: providing material support to al Qaeda, conspiring to provide material support for al Qaeda and conspiring to use a destructive device in relation to a crime of violence. The Manchester plot was allegedly part of a three-pronged plan that included attacks on the New York City subway system and on a newsroom in Copenhagen. None were carried out. The New York plot allegedly originated with Najibullah Zazi, who is believed to have corresponded with the same al Qaeda contact as Naseer. Zazi pleaded guilty to terrorism charges and was the first witness in Naseer's trial. Naseer, a Pakistani national, was in the United Kingdom on a student visa at the time of his arrest. Among the evidence presented, prosecutors pointed out that Naseer had dropped out of classes after only a week. Naseer had no intention of completing his studies because \"that was never the plan,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Zainab Ahmad argued, saying that Naseer applied for a student visa as a means of entering the country to carry out the attack. Naseer maintained throughout the two-week trial that he was innocent, repeatedly denying all charges and insisting that he was in the United Kingdom to find a wife, not to plan an attack. He represented himself. He told jury members that prosecutors were only able to produce circumstantial evidence, with no witnesses offering direct information of Naseer's role in the alleged plot. They did not offer any outright proof of any link to al Qaeda or any other terrorist organization, he argued. Naseer's arrest in England was part of a massive sweep in connection with an alleged plot to carry out bomb attacks in Britain. He was extradited in January 2013.","highlights":"Naseer is convicted of supporting al Qaeda, conspiring to bomb a shopping center in England .\nHe maintained his innocence throughout the two-week trial in New York ."}

Never one to miss a media opportunity, Trump, the owner of the Blue Monster course in Florida, got a scuba diver to retrieve the 3-iron club which world No. 1 McIlroy had thought he had seen the last of during Friday's second round at the WGC-Cadillac Championship. The 68-year-old American entrepreneur presented it to McIlroy before his final round Sunday, telling him that it was unlucky to continue playing with 13 clubs as against the usual 14 allowed under golf's rules. \"He's never one to miss an opportunity,\" McIlroy told the official PGA Tour website after his round. \"It was fine. It was good fun.\" Not that opportunity knocked for McIlroy when he chose the 3-iron to play his third shot to the 18th and final hole of the tournament and promptly found the water again. The Northern Irishman feigned to repeat his earlier antics, before placing it back in the bag. His mistake led to a double bogey six and left him tied for ninth at one-under-par, eight shots behind winner Dustin Johnson. McIlroy had promised to return the club to Trump after the round and was as good as his word. \"We're thinking about auctioning it for charity or doing a trophy case for Doral, putting it on a beautiful mount,\" Trump said. Johnson is looking set to be one of McIlroy's main rivals in the first major of the season, the U.S. Masters at Augusta, next month and his victory completed a triumphant comeback to the PGA Tour. The 30-year-old American took a six-month break from the Tour last July to cope with \"personal problems\" and returned earlier this year. Johnson finished with a three-under 69 in testing conditions to leave him one ahead of long-time leader JB Holmes and two clear of Bubba Watson, the reigning Masters champion.

Judd retweeted messages that are too explicit to include here. \"Everyone needs to take personal responsibility for what they write and not allowing this misinterpretation and shaming culture on social media to persist,\" Judd said. \"And by the way I'm pressing charges.\" The actor, who is also an advocate for women's rights, added: \"The amount of gender violence that I experience is absolutely extraordinary, and a significant part of my day today will be spent filing police reports at home about gender violence that's directed at me on social media.\" Twitter, trolls and sports collided recently in another high-profile social media fight involving former Major League Baseball pitcher Curt Schilling.

Revenge porn is sexually explicit material posted online without the consent of one or more participants.

{"article":"(CNN)On any other Wednesday morning, the steps in front of the Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium would be packed with kids on their way to class, discussing homework, chattering about last night's TV shows, or laying out plans for the coming weekend. But not today. Instead, students approached in silence, carrying photographs and flowers. In small groups, the teenagers lined up to lay tributes to their lost classmates before hugging each other wordlessly, or dissolving into tears. At 10:53 a.m. Tuesday morning, this school in the small western German town of Haltern was changed forever by events more than 1,000 km (about 620 miles) away. A Germanwings plane carrying 16 of its pupils and their two teachers home from a school exchange trip to Spain crashed in the French Alps, killing all of those on board. Headmaster Ulrich Wessel said when the first reports of a crash came through he was still hopeful, thinking \"perhaps they had missed the plane, or perhaps there was a second Germanwings flight at the same time.\" Instead, the worst was confirmed, leaving him \"stunned and somewhat speechless,\" the community devastated and the classmates of the dead struggling to understand their loss. \"A week ago Tuesday we sent 16 happy young people and two young colleagues off on a trip,\" Wessel told reporters. \"What was intended as a school exchange ended in tragedy.\" Of the 16 teenagers killed, 14 were girls, and two boys; one of the two female teachers who died was a newlywed. In a post on the school's website, Wessel and other school representatives announced the names of the dead, \"who will never again return to us,\" leaving all those concerned \"unutterably sad.\" The teenagers who died were: Linda Bergjurgen, Elena Bless, Lea Druppel, Selina Eils, Gina Michelle Gerdes, Ann-Christin Hahn, Julia Hermann, Marleen Koch, Paula Lutkenhaus, Fabio Rogge, Rabea Scheideler, Lea Schukart, Helena Siebe, Steffen Strang, Aline Venhoff and Caja Westermann. The two teachers were identified as Sonja Cercek and Stefanie Tegethoff. As news of the crash spread, the area at the entrance to the school became a makeshift memorial, filled with red and white candles, notes and swiftly-painted signs. \"Yesterday we were many, today we are alone,\" reads one. \"Why?\" demands another, with painful simplicity. Philippa, a friend of many of those who died, told CNN she was shocked by what had happened: \"I knew all of them, they were in my grade. To some I was very close. \"We had already planned things for the future, what we were going to do when they returned from their trip. It is very hard to believed that we cannot do that.\" Grief counselors, chaplains and psychologists have been brought in to the school to help all of those involved come to terms with the disaster. \"I've told the students and teachers that we have to accept the sorrow and grieve,\" said Wessel. \"I hope we will all get through it, if we share it.\" As the world's media descend on the town, messages of support have come flooding in too. The local newspaper is running an online book of condolence, in which people can leave messages of sympathy and \"light\" virtual candles to match the real ones flickering on the steps of the school. \"A silent hug says more than many words,\" wrote Manuela Donovang. \"Wishing the families, friends and relatives strength and comfort in the difficult days and months ahead.\" In his message, Udo Hentschel said the suffering of the parents, friends and families was \"incomprehensible, unfathomable\" and offered them his condolences: \"This, the worst of all fates, will bind us all -- friends and strangers -- closer together.\" In an attempt to show that solidarity, schools across the region will share a moment of silence in memory of the dead on Friday at 10:53 a.m., the time the plane crashed. For the classmates of those who will never return, that silence will go on, as the seats they left empty remain unfilled in the weeks and months to come. \"Our school is no longer what it once was,\" said Wessel. \"In Haltern we had 1,283 students. It is horrifying that now we have 16 fewer.\"","highlights":"German town of Haltern in mourning after loss of 16 students and two teachers in plane crash .\nGroup was returning from school exchange trip to Spain when aircraft went down in French Alps .\nHeadteacher says school is in mourning, classmates struggling to understand what happened ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Australian cricket great Shane Warne has been criticized for promoting an unhealthy drinking culture, following post-match interviews at cricket's World Cup final in which he repeatedly quizzed players about their drinking plans. Acting as part of the commentary team for Australian broadcaster Channel Nine, Warne interviewed the victorious Australian players at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in the wake of their comfortable win over New Zealand. Broadcast live and amplified throughout the stadium, the exchanges -- in which Warne seemed preoccupied with how much the players planned to drink -- prompted a backlash on social media using the hashtag \"#thirsty.\" To wicketkeeper Brad Haddin, Warne asked: \"You feeling thirsty?\" He continued the theme with Steve Smith, asking: \"What about you, gonna have a bit of a drink tonight too Smitty? Gonna get thirsty as well? The boys are thirsty they seem.\" Shane Watson and Josh Hazlewood were subjected to a similar line of questioning: . \"So what's the plan, besides lots of drink and that, how long's that gonna last? Just one night, two nights?\" asked Warne. The comments sparked an immediate reaction on Twitter, with users criticizing Warne for setting a poor example to young cricket fans, and one labeling him a \"bogan\" -- Australasian slang for an unsophisticated person -- for his line of questioning. Some Twitter users played on Warne's publicized fondness for the Tinder dating app, which has seen the former cricketer hit the headlines in recent times. Not all responses were critical, with British journalist Piers Morgan among those coming to Warne's defense. Warne, a noted bon vivant who was often photographed with drink in hand after wins during his playing days, took to Twitter to tell his detractors to \"get stuffed.\" Warne's interviews provoked further discussion on Australian television Monday when, on the \"Today\" show, Channel Nine presenter David Campbell criticized the example he set. \"I hate this,\" he said. \"There is a stadium full of young men and women who look up to these guys, and it would have been nice if one of those cricketers was accountable enough to say 'Nothing will be better than what I did on this field, Warnie'.\" \"We can't sit around here... going 'We have a drinking problem' and then sit there and celebrate that.\" The boozy indiscretions of professional athletes often make the news in Australia, although players from the footballing codes of rugby union, rugby league and Australian rules are more commonly in the spotlight. Members of the successful Australian team partied late into the night Sunday, with coach Darren Lehmann tweeting a picture of team members celebrating in their uniforms as the sun came up, with drinks in hand. Warne's inquiries about the team's plans to celebrate were apparently not in vain. At about 3 a.m. he posted a picture on Instagram of himself holding the World Cup trophy alongside Australian captain Michael Clarke, the latter with a drink at his side.","highlights":"Australian cricket legend Shane Warne is criticized for post-match interview questions .\nHe seemed preoccupied with how Australian team were planning to celebrate World Cup win .\nCritics said the comments promoted an unhealthy drinking culture to sports fans ."}
{"article":"Moscow (CNN)Four days after he was gunned down by an unknown assailant in the heart of Moscow, former Russian Deputy Prime Minister and outspoken Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov was laid to rest Tuesday in a ceremony attended by hundreds of mourners. His coffin was lowered into the ground at the Troyekurovskoe Cemetery before family, friends and dignitaries, after being carried in procession through Moscow. Mourners laid wreaths, some with ribbons in the colors of the Russian flag, reflecting tributes to a man whom supporters called a true Russian patriot. Earlier, a stream of people took part in a somber memorial service at the Sakharov Center in Moscow. Some held flowers as they filed past the open casket of the prominent Kremlin critic and paid respects to his mother, Dina Eydman, and his children Anton and Zhanna. Hundreds more lined up in the cold outside. Mikhail Kasyanov, a former prime minister under President Vladimir Putin who is now a leading opposition figure and worked closely with Nemtsov, was among the mourners to speak at the service. He said he believed Nemtsov, known for his outspoken views, was killed out of revenge for his politics. He also said he thought the killers would be brought to justice, under the next government of Russia if not the current one. The assassination has spawned a flood of conspiracy theories. Though politically marginalized in recent years, Nemtsov was one of Putin's most vocal critics, and many suspect the Kremlin of either direct or indirect involvement. Putin has vowed to bring those responsible to justice. No one has yet been arrested and authorities have put forward a number of theories, including that the murder was an act of \"provocation\" intended to destabilize Russia, that it was connected to the conflict in Ukraine, that Islamist extremists were involved or that it was linked to Nemtsov's international business affairs. The Moscow Investigative Committee said in a statement on its website Tuesday that \"all scenarios\" are being considered and that it is taking all necessary steps. \"Eyewitness are being questioned, CCTV footage is already being analyzed. Evidence has been collected. A number of tests were carried out -- among them are ballistic, medical examination and trace evidence,\" it said. The memorial service was hosted by Pavel Sheremet, a Russian journalist known for leaving a Russian state TV channel in protest at the Kremlin's current policies on Ukraine. Other prominent Russian figures at the service included Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's spokeswoman Natalya Timakova, and former Finance Minister Alexey Kudrin. Russian economist Yevgeny Yasin, who served as economy minister between 1994 and 1997 and is now an academic, said: \"Nemtsov always said everything that others were afraid to say.\" Evgeniya Albats, editor-in-chief of The New Times magazine, described Nemtsov in a speech as an amazing friend and a fearless politician. She added, \"This murder is impossible to forgive. It's on Putin's conscience.\" Foreign dignitaries included U.S. ambassador to Russia John Tefft, who said Nemtsov would be remembered as a Russian patriot, and former UK Prime Minister John Major. Major told CNN: \"It's clearly a very sad day for Russians, it's a very sad day for Boris' family, and I'm personally extremely saddened by what has happened. \"I knew him in the 1990s, I admired him, I admired what he stood for, and I hope now a thorough investigation will determine who is responsible for this outrage.\" The opposition politician was shot Friday night as he walked across a bridge about 100 meters (330 feet) from the Kremlin with his girlfriend, Ukrainian model Anna Duritskaya, 23. Duritskaya -- the only known witness to the shooting -- left Moscow for Kiev late on Monday. She had been staying at the apartment of an aide to Nemtsov under constant police guard. Her mother, Inna Duritskaya, told CNN on Monday that her daughter faces constant psychological pressure from Moscow authorities and fears she will be implicated in his death. The Moscow Investigative Committee said Duritskaya was not detained while in Moscow and that she was offered witness protection, which she turned down. Duritskaya was free to leave at any point but wanted to give her testimony and contribute to the investigation process, \"understanding the important of it for the investigation,\" the statement said. \"It is needless to state how important her testimony is.\" Edward Lucas, a senior editor for The Economist and a senior vice president at the Center for European Policy Analysis, told CNN that the manner of Nemtsov's death was highly suspicious. \"The circumstances of his shooting point very much to official involvement,\" he said. \"If it was some random, ragtag extremist militia from eastern Ukraine killing him, I doubt they would've been able to do it with such precision in the heart of Moscow.\" Lucas also said that the recent history of politically motivated killings in Russia suggested that the investigation would come to little. \"One of the signal things that they all have in common is that they are not cleared up. We have a lot of bluster at the time of the death, promises of investigation, but either the culprits are never found or the culprits who are found are very unconvincing ones and the people who gave the orders are never identified.\" Meanwhile, he said, the Kremlin continues to pump out propaganda which suggests opposition activists or those critical of Russia's involvement in Ukraine are traitors to their country. Some of Nemtsov's supporters accuse the Kremlin, if not of direct involvement, of creating an atmosphere of hatred which fostered the killing. Not everyone who hoped to attend Nemtsov's funeral has been able to do so. Latvia's former foreign minister and European Parliament member Sandra Kalniete said she was denied entry to Russia on Monday night on spurious grounds. Speaking to CNN by phone from Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport, Kalniete said she was finally told she was refused entry \"according to Russia's code of law regarding the defense and security of the Russian state and the general health of the public.\" She had intended to represent Latvia and the European People's Party -- the biggest parliamentary group in the European Parliament -- at the funeral, she said. \"Like many I admired him, I admired his joyfulness and eloquence,\" Kalniete said. \"My wish was not to cause any danger to Russia. I just wanted to go to pay tribute to a political personality, Boris Nemtsov.\" The European People's Party said it was the third time a member of the European Parliament had been stopped at the Russian border. Thousands of Nemtsov supporters gathered Sunday in Moscow to mourn the death of the 55-year-old, who was deputy prime minister during President Boris Yeltsin's administration in the 1990s. The event took place the same day Nemtsov was supposed to lead a rally in Moscow decrying Russia's policies on Ukraine. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said last weekend that Nemtsov was about to reveal information that would be damaging to Russian interests, Ukraine's state-run Ukrinform news agency reported. Putin condemned the killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate the shooting, the Kremlin said. The President also wrote to Nemtsov's mother, saying he shared her grief, and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice, the Kremlin said. Police said they are looking for a man with short hair who stands between 5 feet 7 inches and 5 feet 9 inches, Russia's official Sputnik news agency reported. The shooter was wearing blue jeans and a brown sweater. Russia's Investigative Committee is offering a reward of 3 million rubles ($49,000) for information leading to the arrest of the killer. It said the tipster will be guaranteed anonymity. CNN's Matthew Chance and Alla Eshchenko reported from Moscow and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London. CNN's Ivan Watson, Emma Burrows and Lucy Pawle contributed to this report.","highlights":"Boris Nemtsov is buried in a Moscow cemetery following a somber memorial service .\nNemtsov \"always said everything that others were afraid to say,\" says one mourner .\nMoscow Investigative Committee says \"all scenarios\" are being considered in Nemtsov slaying ."}
{"article":"(CNN)One of the nine suspects was killed. Another was shot in the stomach. All eight responding officers were injured, including one 10-year veteran who required surgery. It's the aftermath of an all-out melee in a Walmart parking lot in Cottonwood, Arizona, a town of 11,000 people about an hour's drive south of Flagstaff. But details are murky outside of the injury and arrest reports. What's known, according to the Arizona Department of Public Safety statement released by spokesman Raul Garcia, is that someone at the store called the Cottonwood Police Department a few minutes before midnight Saturday to report that a woman who worked at Walmart \"had been assaulted in the store by multiple suspects.\" The suspects were in the parking lot when police responded, and they immediately attacked the officers, the DPS statement said. Two suspects were shot, one in the abdomen and one fatally, while one of the suspects shot a Cottonwood officer in the leg, according to DPS. \"I heard about eight to 10 shots,\" Louie Solano, an eyewitness, told CNN affiliate KPHO.  \"It was a lot of noise. It looked like a riot in the middle of the parking lot. I mean it was unbelievable,\" he said. Investigators believe the nine suspects were all from the same family. \"We believe they are from Idaho because of the license plate on their vehicle,\"  DPS spokesman Bart Graves told CNN. The condition of the suspect who was shot in the stomach was not known. Seven other suspects were taken into custody, the statement said, and \"a total of eight officers and another (Walmart) employee were assaulted in the parking lot during the fight. Seven of those officers sustained minor injuries to include lacerations and bruising.\" The Walmart employee, who was a loss prevention officer, had a broken arm,  Graves said. The 31-year-old officer who suffered the gunshot wound was flown to Flagstaff Medical Center, where he underwent surgery. The veteran officer is expected to make a full recovery, according to the statement. The Cottonwood Police Department and the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office directed media questions to DPS. Asked for additional information, Arizona DPS spokesman Bart Graves said, \"This is a very complex investigation, we are still sorting things out and there are a lot of witnesses to talk to, so we are in the early stages.\" He added, \"We were asked by Cottonwood police to conduct a criminal investigation.\" CNN's Brian Carberry contributed to this report.","highlights":"The shot officer underwent surgery and is expected to make full recovery, police say .\nIncident began when police got report that Walmart employee was attacked, statement says .\nPolice:  Nine suspects, believed to be from the same family, \"immediately\" began attacking them ."}

Spieth won a three-way play-off with a 28-foot birdie on the third extra hole to become only the fourth player since 1940 to win twice on the PGA Tour before turning 22. It is a feat that not even McIlroy mastered with Tiger Woods, Sergio Garcia and Robert Gamez the only players to have achieved that particular accolade in the past 75 years. But it is the Northern Irishman that is within Spieth's focus heading towards Augusta. \"I like studying the game, being a historian of the game,\" Spieth told the PGA Tour website. \"It's really cool to have my name go alongside those. \"But right now currently what I'm really focused on is Rory McIlroy and the No.1 in the world.

On Sunday, he held his nerve at the Innisbrook Resort in Palm Harbor, Florida, to hold on for the victory. He first rescued par on the 16th with a 60-foot bunker shot and needed a 32-foot putt to ensure his place in the playoff, which he duly holed. It was a putt of similar length that ensured a second Tour win to add to his John Deere Classic success in July 2013, which he also won courtesy of a playoff making him the youngest PGA Tour winner for 82 years at the time.","highlights":"Jordan Spieth only the fourth player since 1940 to seal two PGA Tour wins under age of 22 .\nGolfing's newest star sets his sights on usurping Rory McIlroy as the world's No.1 .\nConfidence is high going into the Masters, in which he finished second a year ago ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Israel's ruling Likud Party pulled off a victory in Tuesday's election -- and it was a stunning one. During the campaign, incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had come in for heavy criticism from across the political spectrum, for reasons ranging from concerns over his frosty relationship with the White House, to his fixation on the Iran nuclear issue, to allegations over Netanyahu's household expenses. Yet despite this unpromising backdrop, Likud is on course to win 30 seats in the Knesset, six seats more than the main opposition Zionist Union -- headed by Isaac Herzog and Tsipi Livni, and an obvious favorite of the Israeli media establishment and Europe, Washington, and the West Bank. The blow to the Zionist Union is particularly painful because some opinion polls had actually had the party leading Likud as the campaign drew to a close. (Likud wasn't the only winner of the night --the new center-right party Kulanu (All of Us), which focuses on the economy, also had a good showing, securing 10 seats). Still, Likud's resounding hasn't settled the eventual makeup of the government -- in the coming weeks, the work of negotiating a coalition will begin. With this in mind, there is a good chance that President Reuven Rivlin will ask Netanyahu to form a national unity government, either with the Zionist Union, or as the head of a right-wing coalition (although the bitter rivalry between Herzog\/Livni and Netanyahu during the campaign makes the latter more likely). Overall, the election results seemed to reflect the rightward shift of the electorate, with even voters who self-identify as centrists consistently expressing conservative positions on both the Palestinian issue and broader questions of national security. Meanwhile, the numbers for the left in Tuesday's election -- a four seats for Meretz, 24 for the Zionist Union and 14 for the Arab List suggests the bloc is some 20 seats short of a viable coalition. As a result, the international community and the Palestinian leadership will have to face the reality that negotiations over the Palestinian state will be conducted with the center-right. So, what can we expect from the new Netanyahu government? Issues that dominated the campaign, namely security and the economy, will likely dominate. For a start, Netanyahu will try to improve his record on domestic and social issues by introducing more proactive policies tied to housing and land reform.  The issue of housing  requires especially painful economic and bureaucratic changes over the Israel Land Authority and planning and zoning processes. But to address these Issues properly, Netanyahu will have to confront land owners and the housing constructors, meaning key structural reforms are unlikely in the short term. In addition, Netanyahu will also have to repair the fractured relationship with Washington, something that may not be easy given that ties with the Obama administration will largely depends on whether a nuclear deal over Iran is reached, and what shape such a deal takes. That raises the question over what direction the government will take over national security, and on this, the government can probably be expected to pursue the status quo. This is despite the fact that growing instability and the proliferation of non-state hostile actors suggests that Israel should instead move beyond a short-term approach and toward building a long-term, comprehensive national security strategy that could make it an integrated regional power. Making such a change would require a political process capable of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, rather than merely kicking the can down the road. Restarting communication with the West Bank leadership and properly engaging with the Arab Peace Initiative would be steps in the right direction. All that said, this will be Netanyahu's fourth term in office, and so there is plenty of evidence with which to judge his likely trajectory. And that suggests that he will find it easier to focus on issues tied to the economy than making any real steps forward on building a comprehensive long-tern national security strategy. Those hoping that the prime minister might rethink his national security policies are likely to be disappointed again.","highlights":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won re-election in Tuesday's poll .\nOlena Bagno-Moldavsky: Netanyahu unlikely to rethink national security policies ."}
{"article":"The International Cricket Council has described the remarks of its own president Mustafa Kamal as 'very unfortunate', and insists its umpires' 'integrity cannot be questioned'. Kamal put himself at the centre of a row over umpiring decisions which went the way of India in their World Cup quarter-final victory over Bangladesh in Melbourne on Thursday. India opener Rohit Sharma was reprieved as he neared his century when a no-ball was called because of the height of the delivery; then Bangladesh batsman Mahmudullah had to go when a marginal call came down in favour of boundary fielder Shikhar Dhawan, whose foot was ruled to be just clear of the rope when he took a catch at fine-leg. Shikhar Dhawan's catch of Bangladesh's batsman Mahmudullah during their quarter final proved controversial . Bangladeshi politician Kamal's ICC role is largely ceremonial since cricket's world governing body updated its constitution a year ago. He has nonetheless threatened to resign over the decisions taken by umpires Aleem Dar and Ian Gould in the match which finished in a 109-run win for India. Kamal implied the result was a foregone conclusion, and that world cricket is being run for the benefit of its superpower India. 'There was no quality in the umpiring. It looked like they took the field after it [the outcome] was pre-arranged,' he said. 'As the ICC president, whatever I have to say I will say it in next meeting. It could happen that maybe I will resign. There was doubt about whether the fielder had made contact with the boundary rope, but the decision stood . 'I cannot represent the \"Indian Cricket Council\". If someone has imposed a result on us, in that case no one can accept it.' ICC chief executive David Richardson has responded with an emphatic dismissal of Kamal's insinuations. He said: 'The ICC has noted Mr Mustafa Kamal's comments, which are very unfortunate but made in his personal capacity. Rohit Sharma was given a reprieve after being caught out off a no ball, and went on to make three figures . 'As an ICC president, he should have been more considerate in his criticism of ICC match officials, whose integrity cannot be questioned. 'The no-ball decision was a 50-50 call. The spirit of the game dictates that the umpire's decision is final and must be respected. 'Any suggestion that the match officials had 'an agenda' or did anything other than perform to the best of their ability are baseless and are refuted in the strongest possible terms.' Mustafa Kamal (right) threatened to resign from the ICC over what he saw as unfair umpiring .","highlights":"Mustafa Kamal has threatened to resign after Bangladesh lost to India .\nBangladesh were on the wrong end of some controversial decisions .\nBut ICC insists umpires' 'integrity cannot be questioned' in World Cup .\nIndia will play Australia in World Cup semi final on Thursday ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Before this week, David Boren didn't need to add to his resume.  It was impressive enough already. The 73-year-old University of Oklahoma president was also a former governor, former U.S. senator and Rhodes scholar. Boren has become the face of the school's stand against racism after a highly visible and passionate condemnation of a video that appears to show Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity members chanting a racial epitaph. It started with a bullhorn at a campus rally. \"I have a message for those who have misused their freedom of speech in this way. My message to them is: You're disgraceful. You have violated every principle that this university stands for.\" It continued with a press conference, saying fraternity members had until midnight Tuesday to get out of their house. \"The house will be closed, and as far as I'm concerned, they won't be back,\" Boren said, adding that the university is exploring what actions it can take against individual fraternity members. And it extended to network television. \"Sooners are not racists.  They're not bigots,\" Boren told CNN in one of his many public reprimands.  \"They are people who respect each other and care about each other.\" Boren spent nearly 30 years in elected office before becoming the 13th president of the University of Oklahoma in 1994. He was a U.S. senator from 1979 to 1994, where he was the longest serving chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Before that, he served four years as Oklahoma's governor. He campaigned as a reformer, with a broom as his symbol, and when elected, he became the youngest governor in the state. He was 33 at the time. Boren is the first person in Oklahoma history to have served all three positions, according to his university biography. Boren graduated from Yale University in 1963, in the top one percent of his class. He was selected as a Rhodes scholar and earned a master's degree in politics, philosophy and economics from Oxford University, England, in 1965. Boren received his law degree from the University of Oklahoma in 1968. Both his father, Lyle, and his son, Dan, served in the U.S. House of Representatives. Zero tolerance is the only answer to racism, Boren said.  Not just for the school, but the nation. \"It's not just the Greek system, it's not just colleges and universities.  It's Ferguson, Missouri.  All sorts of elements of our society are involved,\" he said. For now, Boren said the school is looking into punishing the individuals involved, especially any of those who led the chants. \"We're trying to determine if we have enough evidence and if we can meet the federal standards to prevail in court, and, if so, we'll take action,\" Boren said. \"This is not a place that wants racists or bigots on our campus or will tolerate it so I think you have to send a very strong signal.\" In the meantime, Boren said he will work with students who are calling for a change, including Unheard, a campus organization that formed in response to the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson. Unheard, along with the university newspaper, anonymously received the video showing the fraternity chant and made it public . Boren started meeting with the group in January, well ahead of the SAE video.  Both sides described the sessions as \"constructive,\" the Washington Post reported Monday. \"They are very constructive.  They have very good ideas and we're going to make it better.  We're determined to make it better,\" Boren told CNN.","highlights":"Boren is the first person in Oklahoma history to serve as governor, senator and OU president .\nHe's the face of the university's stand against racism ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Slain Russian opposition figure Boris Nemtsov knew criticizing the Kremlin was dangerous, but thought his fame would protect him. The 55-year-old was walking home from dinner with his girlfriend Anna Duritskaya when he was gunned down in Moscow on Friday. Nemtsov had been arrested several times for speaking against Putin's government. The most recent arrests were in 2011 when he protested the results of parliamentary elections and in 2012 when tens of thousands protested against Putin. In an interview with CNN's Anthony Bourdain last year, Nemtsov spoke of the deaths of other Kremlin critics, but said his fame offered some protection. \"I'm a well-known guy, and this is a safety because if something happens with me, it will be scandal not only in Moscow city but throughout the world,\" he said then. After Nemtsov was shot, Putin condemned the killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate the shooting, the Kremlin said in a statement. But critics of Putin have in the past suffered miserable fates. Last year, a Moscow court sentenced five men to prison for the 2006 killing of Russian journalist and fierce Kremlin critic Anna Politkovskaya. Business magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky accused Putin of corruption and spent 10 years in prison and labor camps. Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko accused state security services of organizing a coup to put Putin in power. He was poisoned by a lethal dose of radioactive polonium and died in London in 2006. No killer has been caught. In their 2014 interview, Nemtsov told Bourdain he believed Russia's existing power structure was like 19th century Russia, with one person in control and no real freedom of press, real competition or elections or an independent judiciary or rule of law. \"You are in the typical country of crony capitalism,\" he said. \"If you have a good relationship with Putin and his people around, you will have a good relationship with governor or mayor -- it doesn't matter. If you are in the city you have a chance to raise money, to be successful ... you know, to buy real estate in the south of France or Switzerland, to open accounts in Swiss banks. \"But, if something happened between you and Putin and you are governor, you will be in jail.\" Nemstov said in most places around the world, wealth provided opportunity and independence, but said that it was different in Russia. \"To be wealthy, you must be loyal. If you want to be independent, forget about business, forget about raising money,\" he said. \"If you are rich, you are a slave. If you are rich, you are very much dependent.\" Many people preferred to be able make money and not speak out, he said. \"This is a country of corruption,\" Nemtsov said. \"For Putin's Russia, this is a system. This is not a problem.\" \"If you are corrupted, but you are loyal, and you serve the Kremlin, you are first of all rich and secondly you are in a very safe position.\"","highlights":"Kremlin critic and opposition figure Boris Nemtsov was fatally shot in Moscow on Friday .\nIn 2014 he had told CNN's Anthony Bourdain his fame offered some protection .\nNemtsov criticized Putin's Russia in the interview saying the power system was corrupt ."}

Sixteen of the 20 clubs in Serie A voted in favour of the measure on Friday. Roma, Napoli and Sassuolo abstained, and only Cesena voted against the move. The measure means last-place Parma should be able to play Atalanta on Sunday, after their previous two matches - at home with Udinese and at Genoa - were postponed indefinitely because the club couldn't pay for basic services such as security and electricity. Parma have an illustrious history, however the club are in dire straits financially and could go out of business .

The club's debts are estimated at nearly 100 million euros (\u00a372m). The emergency fund will come from money that clubs pay to the league for fines from crowd trouble and other violations. After the league decision in Milan, Italian football federation president Carlo Tavecchio was traveling to Parma to formally present the plan to the squad's players. The plan requires Parma to play its next two matches before the bankruptcy hearing. Parma captain\u00a0Alessandro Lucarelli and his club team-mates have not been paid since July .

{"article":"(CNN)Jeffrey Williams admitted he fired the shots that struck two officers in Ferguson, police said, but claimed he wasn't aiming for them. Nonetheless, the 20-year-old from the St. Louis area has been arrested for the shootings of two police officers during last week's protests in Ferguson, Missouri, a prosecutor said Sunday. Williams has been charged with two counts of first-degree assault, a count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal activity, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch said. He described Williams as a frequent protester in the city -- which some took issue with. Bishop Derrick Robinson, an area organizer, said he spoke to Williams on Sunday. \"I asked him why would he say that he was a protester because it makes us look bad -- because so many things that we've done to rebuild our community,\" Robinson said. \"It sets us like five steps back to say that it was a protester who did it, but he admitted to me that he'd never protested.\" For more than 200 days, protests have taken place in Ferguson since the August shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson was not indicted. At the time of his arrest, Williams was on probation for receiving stolen property. The prosecutor thanked the public for the information that led to the arrest. He said police served a search warrant on Williams' residence where they seized a .40-caliber handgun, \"which has been tied to the shell casings that were recovered\" at the scene of the shooting. Williams is being held on a cash-only $300,000 bond, McCulloch said, adding that it's possible Williams could face more charges and that others could be charged in the case. One element of the case that authorities have yet to sort out is intent, McCulloch said, adding that Williams has acknowledged firing the shots but has said he wasn't aiming at the police officers. Investigators are not sure they \"buy\" Williams' claim that he opened fire after a dispute with other individuals, McCulloch said, but he didn't rule it out. \"It's possible he was firing at someone else,\" he said, urging any other witnesses with information to come forward. The shots rang out from a hill overlooking the city's police station shortly after midnight Wednesday, at the end of a protest against the Ferguson Police Department, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at the time. Officers saw \"muzzle flashes ... about 125 yards away,\" Belmar said. \"We could have buried two police officers,\" Belmar told reporters last week. \"I feel very confident that whoever did this ... came there for whatever nefarious reason that it was.\" Public donations poured in to be used toward a reward to find the gunman and any accomplices, Belmar said. Authorities offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of person or persons responsible for the gunfire upon the two officers, according to the St. Louis Regional CrimeStoppers website. McCulloch said the tipster whose information led to Williams' arrest is eligible to receive the reward. Protesters said they had nothing to do with the shooting, and that the shots came from a grassy hill away from the crowd. \"In no way are they representative of the thousands of people ... who have been protesting,\" said Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman. Belmar believes someone targeted the police, who have faced heated criticism for months, he said. \"These police officers were standing there, and they were shot just because they were police officers,\" he said. The department has been criticized since the shooting death of Brown and, more recently, since a scathing U.S. Department of Justice report documented a pattern of racial discrimination in the city. Police Chief Thomas Jackson resigned Wednesday. \"We are actively addressing the issues that have raised concerns of fairness and fair treatment. We support peaceful protesting. However, we will not allow, nor tolerate, the destructive and violent actions of a few to disrupt our unifying efforts,\" the mayor of Ferguson and the City Council said in a statement Sunday. While many protesters have decried the Ferguson Police Department, neither of the officers shot last week were from the city. One is from Webster Groves, a St. Louis suburb 13 miles south of Ferguson. The officer -- a 32-year-old with seven years' experience -- was shot at the high point of his cheek, just under his right eye, Belmar said. The other was hit in the shoulder and the bullet came out the middle of his back, Belmar said. He is a 41-year-old officer with the St. Louis County Police Department, who has been in law enforcement for 14 years. Both men have been treated and released. CNN's Carma Hassan, Sara Sidner, Jason Carroll, Shimon Prokupecz, Evan Perez and Alina Machado contributed to this report.","highlights":"Jeffrey Williams, 20, is charged with two counts of first-degree assault, prosecutor says .\nProsecutor thanks the public for leading police to a .40-caliber allegedly used in shooting .\nTwo officers, neither from the Ferguson Police Department, were shot during protests last week ."}
{"article":"(CNN)There were screams. Then the sounds of a commercial jetliner slamming into the mountainside. And finally silence. Deathly silence. That much is known about the final few minutes for the 144 passengers on Germanwings Flight 9525. Beyond that, it's a matter of imagination and speculation -- about what they saw and what they felt as their plane approached and then crashed into the Alps. None of them can speak for themselves, nor can any of the flight's six crew members. But authorities have given some clues, based on what investigators know about the aircraft's trajectory and what they've heard on a mangled cockpit voice recorder recovered at the crash site. It all began on what seemed like most any other Tuesday as citizens of 18 countries packed into the Germanwings plane in Barcelona, Spain. The passengers came from all walks of life, using Lufthansa's low-cost carrier to get to Dusseldorf, Germany. They were high school students, heading home after a week in Spain. They were parents and children enjoying their vacation. There were businessmen, scouting out store locations. There was a 26-minute delay before takeoff because air traffic controllers didn't give the OK to start the plane's engines earlier and there was a small wait in the takeoff rotation, according to Lufthansa. For any frequent flier, that kind of delay is nothing abnormal. Nor, it seems, was takeoff. The Airbus A320 left and headed northeast at 10:01 a.m. (5:01 a.m. ET) on what should have been a 726-mile journey. The plane leveled off at 38,000 feet, its cruising altitude. By this point, passengers would be OK to unbuckle, head to the restroom or get their bags out of the overhead bin. A seemingly innocuous act changed everything: The aircraft's pilot had to use the restroom, according to Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr, telling the co-pilot that he was stepping out. It's possible that passengers saw the captain in the cabin, going to or from the restroom. They also could have noticed that the aircraft was going down -- even though they were about a half-hour into a nearly two-hour flight, with the Alps ahead of them. The passengers couldn't have known it, but the co-pilot -- identified as 28-year-old Andreas Lubitz --\"manipulated the buttons of the flight monitoring system to activate the descent of the aircraft\" while the pilot was out, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said Thursday. This was around 10:45 a.m. It wasn't like the plane suddenly jerked down, plunging straight into the ground. Authorities described a steady descent at a rate of about 3,000 to 3,500 feet (or roughly 1,000 meters) per minute. Still, it is the kind of descent you'd expect while nearing an airport -- not traversing the Alps. If passengers didn't notice that fall, they might have caught wind of what was happening at the front of the plane. Students, singers among the victims . Inside the cockpit, the only sound was that of Lubitz breathing steadily. But outside the cockpit, the noises apparently grew louder and more frantic. The pilot tried to open the door but couldn't get in. He likely knocked on the door. He used a video conference system to talk to the co-pilot, Robin said. None of it worked. Nor did his last-ditch attempt, as recounted by a senior French military official involved in the crash investigation to The New York Times. \"You can hear he is trying to smash the door down,\" the official said. Did the passengers hear this commotion upfront? It's hard to imagine they didn't. And if that wasn't reason enough to cause worry, they just had to look outside -- at the mountain chain that should have been far below them instead of getting closer and closer and closer. The voice recorder didn't indicate any abnormal noise in the cabin until the final few moments. Still, even if the passengers didn't know it at the time, all it took was eight minutes for a seemingly normal flight to become a nightmare. The nightmare ended in a violent crash into rugged, remote terrain. So did the screams and the lives of all 150 people on Flight 9525 -- a death that Robin described as \"instantaneous.\" Who was co-pilot Andreas Lubitz?","highlights":"Germanwings Flight 9525 had a slight delay before taking off from Barcelona, Spain .\nAfter leveling off at 38,000 feet, the plane descended steadily before hitting the Alps .\nScreams were heard in plane's cabin in minutes before crash, according to audio recording ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Dropping red meat, and sticking to a plant-based diet that incorporates fish may be the key to preventing colorectal (colon and rectum) cancers, according to a seven-year study published Monday. Pescetarians, as they are commonly referred, had a 43% lower chance of getting the cancer compared to people with omnivorous diets. Why focus on colorectal cancer? It is the third most diagnosed cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the US in 2014, according to American Cancer Society statistics. The disease is particularly dangerous because it is usually asymptomatic in its early stages, making it more difficult to detect when it's less deadly. Only 59% of those recommended for screenings receive procedures that are in line with the American Cancer Society's standards. The study, which followed nearly 78,000 people and was published in the Journal of American Medical Association, adds to the growing body of evidence touting the health benefits of a plant-based diet. Another study, reviewing data from 39 separate studies showing that a plant based diet leads to an average drop in blood pressure similar to 30-60 minutes of exercise per day. Yet another study from last year found an average weight loss of nearly 7.5 pounds for vegetarians. While evidence shows the health benefits of reducing red meat consumption, the recent study highlights the differences between even a fully vegetarian diet and a pescetarian diet. Within the sample group there was a 27% drop in the risk of contracting colorectal cancer if you switch from fully vegetarian to eating fish. The authors of the study suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may be the key to such a low risk of cancer in the pescetarian group. Nutritionist Lisa Drayer agrees. \"In addition to other dietary factors, fish may provide added protection from its high content omega-3 fatty acids. This is consistent with previous research that has found omega-3s have anti-cancer activity and that they may be helpful in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.\" Some questions can be raised though, from observing the recent study's participants Seventh Day Adventists, a group that typically avoids alcohol and tobacco. But despite the caveat, Drayer is optimistic. \"While the study is observational and cannot prove a cause\/effect relationship, it is exciting to think that in addition to regular screenings, a diet rich in fish and fiber-rich foods may play an important role in reducing the risk of colorectal cancer.\"","highlights":"A new study shows a 43% lower risk of contracting colorectal cancer with a pesco-vegetarian diet .\nColorectal cancers are the third most diagnosed cancers in the U.S.\nPlant-based diets may also contribute to greater weight loss and lower blood pressure ."}
{"article":"Fall River, Massachusetts  (CNN)Shayanna Jenkins, the fiancee of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez, revealed for the first time Monday she suspects marijuana was in a box she was instructed to remove from the couple's home the day after the slaying of Odin Lloyd in 2013. Hernandez has been charged with murder and has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the death of Lloyd, the boyfriend of Shayanna Jenkins' sister and semipro football player who was found dead June 17, 2013. Hernandez has also pleaded not guilty to a gun and ammunition charge. His co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, have also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. For the first time, Shayanna Jenkins told jurors on Monday the box smelled \"skunky,\" making her think it was marijuana. Her new description came during cross-examination. Earlier, she told prosecutors during direct examination that she didn't know what was in the box, said Hernandez never told her, nor did she look. Jenkins testified Friday that on the day after Lloyd's slaying, her fiance called her with instructions that it was important to discard the box.  On Monday, she described his tone as \"normal\" when he made the request and said she had never been asked by prosecutors what she thought the box smelled like. \"Were you ever asked what you thought was in the box?\" asked Hernandez lawyer Charles Rankin about her previous testimony to the grand jury. \"Never,\" said Jenkins. \"Were you ever asked if it had any smell to it?\" he asked. \"Never,\" she replied. Jenkins' revelation contradicts the prosecution's previous suspicion that the weapon used in the slaying was in the box. No weapon in the case has been recovered. Home surveillance video played inside the courtroom Monday showed  Shayanna Jenkins hoisting a black garbage bag from her home and putting it in a trunk of her sister's car. At the time, Shaneah Jenkins had been at her home grieving over the death of her boyfriend. Shaneah Jenkins was present in court on Monday and cried while listening to the testimony and watching the video of her sister Shayanna carrying the trash bag. The two sisters now barely speak to each other. Shaneah Jenkins sits next to Lloyd's mother in the courtroom on the opposite side of Hernandez's defense team. After concealing the box with her daughter's clothing, Shayanna Jenkins said she disposed of it at a location she cannot remember. \"I found a random dumpster, and put it in there,\" she told Bristol County District Attorney William McCauley. When questioned about her inability to remember the dumpster's location and other details, Shayanna Jenkins said she had been unsettled at the time. \"I was nervous. I had to comfort my sister. Everyone's emotions were on me, and it was a form of breaking down at that point,\" she said. On Monday, Shayanna Jenkins was asked about what she called  an \"on-again, off-again\" relationship with Hernandez, her high school sweetheart. She recalled spending time apart from Hernandez after discovering evidence of infidelity on Hernandez's phone. She told the court that before getting back together with him, she had to make a difficult choice about her future with the football star. \"I made a decision that if I was going to move back in with Aaron, I would need to compromise with his behavior, including his infidelity,\" she told the courtroom and then started to cry. After Hernandez proposed in October 2012, Jenkins said she continued to tolerate his infidelity. Jenkins admitted giving some different answers during her grand jury testimony, in part, she said because of confusing questions by prosecutors. She faces possible jail time if found guilty of perjury charges. Jenkins has pleaded not guilty. This week, the jury is expected to hear from Alexander Bradley, Hernandez's former right hand man, who has accused Hernandez of shooting him in the face in February of 2013. However, a judge has barred him from discussing that. Bradley is jailed in an unrelated shooting. The trial is scheduled to resume at 9 a.m. Tuesday. Susan Candiotti and Lawrence Crook reported from Fall River, Massachusetts.

{"article":"London (CNN)Mohammed Emwazi, the British-Kuwaiti ISIS fighter the world knows as \"Jihadi John,\" was fuming with righteous indignation when he met with a representative of Cage Prisoners -- a Muslim advocacy group now known as CAGE -- shortly after being deported from Tanzania in August 2009. In a meeting recorded by the advocacy group, he claimed his plans for a safari vacation were ruined when he was detained at the airport and sent back first to Amsterdam and then to Dover, England, where he was subjected to several interrogations by British security officials. He said they accused him of traveling to Tanzania so he could link up with the terrorist group Al-Shabaab in neighboring Somalia and revealed they had been listening in on his phone conversations even before he made the trip. Emwazi said that during the questioning he denied any connection to extremism and stated that innocent people had been killed in the 2005 London transport system terrorist attacks and that the 9\/11 terror attacks in the United States were wrong. Father: No proof my son is 'Jihadi John' But more than a dozen British administrative court documents obtained by CNN paint a very different picture of Emwazi and explain why he was on British security services' radar before he made the trip. The documents reveal British security services believed Emwazi was part of a radical West London recruitment network for terrorist groups in East Africa. Last week, two U.S. officials and two U.S. congressional sources confirmed to CNN that \"Jihadi John\" is Mohammed Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born Londoner. One figure in the group -- a 30-year-old British-Iranian identified only as \"CE\" who was allegedly trained by al Qaeda terrorists in Somalia in 2006 -- was later placed under a \"control order,\" a British administrative measure to restrict the freedom of movement of terror suspects. A December 2011 court document pertaining to CE's case named Emwazi as part of his extremist network. According to the document, British Home Secretary Theresa May \"maintained she has reasonable grounds for suspicion that since his return to the United Kingdom in February 2007, CE has continued to associate regularly with members of a network of United Kingdom and East African-based Islamist extremists which is involved in the provision of funds and equipment to Somalia for terrorism-related purposes and the facilitation of individuals' travel from the United Kingdom to Somalia to undertake terrorism-related activity. The Secretary of State maintains that members of the network include BX, J1, Mohammed Ezzouek, Hamza Chentouf, Mohammed Emwazi, Mohammed Mekki, Mohammed Miah, Ahmed Hagi, Amin Addala, Aydarus Elmi, Sammy Al-Nagheeb, Bilal Berjawi and others.\" Some of these men are now dead. Others are wanted. CE told British officials that Mekki and Emwazi often stopped by his wife's apartment. Several of the visits were in early 2011, according to the document. Many of the young men in this network grew up within a few blocks of Emwazi in West London. According to the court documents, security services believe five members of the group -- CE, Berjawi, BX, Ezzouek, Miah and Chentouf -- attended an al Qaeda training camp in Somalia in 2006 in which they may have been instructed in the use of explosives. The camp was run by two veteran al Qaeda operatives, Saleh Nabhan and Fazul Mohammed, who instructed the British group to return to the United Kingdom \"to carry out facilitation activities and to recruit individuals to work on behalf of al Qaeda and\/or Al-Shabaab,\" according to the British government. Nabhan and Fazul Mohammed were the most-wanted al Qaeda operatives in Africa and, according to a 2009 U.S. State Department cable, their training camps offered far more advanced instruction than that offered by Al-Shabaab. Nabhan, a Kenyan operative, was suspected of playing a key operational role in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1998, as well as a bomb attack on a resort in Mombasa in 2002, and on the same day, a failed missile attack on an Israeli airliner taking off from Mombasa's airport. Fazul Mohammed, who was born on the Comoros Islands, was also suspected of playing a key role in the bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998.  He wrote in a 2009 memoir that Western recruits should be provided with training rather than instantly dispatched as suicide bombers within Somalia \"to build sleeping cells around the world.\" Nabhan was killed in a U.S. Navy SEAL raid in September 2009 and Fazul Mohammed was killed in an ambush in Mogadishu in June 2011. Authorities recovered a document on a thumb drive found on his body -- probably authored by a British recruit -- proposing an attack on targets including Eton College and the five-star Dorchester and Ritz hotels in the United Kingdom, similar to the 2008 Mumbai, India, attacks that killed more than 160 people. The author proposed two months' training in Somalia for British and Western recruits selected for the attack, including target reconnaissance, hostage-taking, weapons and counter-surveillance. According to the court documents, at least one member of Emwazi's circle -- J1, a 36-year-old Ethiopian asylum seeker to the United Kingdom -- had links to the al Qaeda cell that attempted to bomb the London transport system on July 21, 2005, two weeks after bomb blasts on London Underground trains and buses killed 52 people and wounded 770. According to the British government, J1, a Christian convert to Islam known in Islamist circles as Abdul Shakur, contacted bomber Hussain Osman by phone on the morning of the July 21 attempted attack. In October 2009, two months after Emwazi's alleged aborted attempt to wage jihad possibly in Somalia, three members of his west London network -- Bilal Berjawi, Mohammed Sakr and Walla Eldin Rahman -- traveled to join the terrorist group Al-Shabaab in Somalia, according to the documents. British security officials estimate that a total of more than 100 British extremists traveled to join the group, according to published reports. The Lebanese-born Berjawi, from St. John's Wood in West London, swiftly rose to a senior position in Al-Shabaab and likely continued to work closely with the senior al Qaeda operative Fazul Mohammed, according to a profile by Raffaello Pantucci, the director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute. According to the UK court documents, Berjawi remained in contact with the radical network he and Emwazi belonged to in the United Kingdom while in Somalia. Berjawi and Sakr were killed in U.S. drone strikes in early 2012. It is possible one of them authored the blueprint for attacks on luxury London hotels found on Fazul Mohammed's body in Mogadishu the previous year. By 2013, Emwazi's West London radical network had a new cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre: the jihad against the Assad regime in Syria. Drone strikes and infighting in Al-Shabaab had made life increasingly difficult for foreign fighters in Somalia. Two members of Emwazi's network managed to leave Britain despite being under \"terrorism prevention and investigation measures\" (TPIMs), which means the monitoring of terror suspects who can't be charged. Their current whereabouts are unknown, but one possibility is that they traveled to Syria. TPIMs were introduced by the British coalition government in 2012 to replace the previous control order system. According to Robin Simcox, a research fellow at the Henry Jackson Society who has conducted extensive research on control orders, the new system removed authorities' power to relocate terror suspects, making it easier for them to re-engage with their radical networks. Both of Emwazi's associates moved back to London and then fled the country. Ibrahim Magag -- a British-Somali man previously identified as \"BX\" under the control order regime -- fled in December 2012 after using scissors to cut through the strap of his GPS location monitoring device. British authorities believe he hailed a London taxi, and disappeared.  He had previously attended the training camp run by the senior al Qaeda operatives Nabhan and Fazul Mohammed in Somalia in 2006 and was involved in fund-raising for al Qaeda in East Africa, according to the court documents. In 2010, prior to the introduction of TPIMs, a British judge had ruled he was \"too dangerous to allow him to be in London for even a short period.\" Nevertheless, the British secretary of state wrote in court documents that \"Magag is not considered to represent a direct threat to the British public. The TPIMs notice in this case was intended primarily to prevent fund-raising and overseas travel.\" His whereabouts today?  Unknown. Mohammed Mohamed -- a Somali-born radical previously identified as \"CC\" -- went on the run in November 2013 after entering a west London mosque and removing his GPS monitoring device. Security cameras captured him leaving the mosque, disguised as a woman wearing a burqa. In 2008, Mohamed had traveled to Somalia, where Al-Shabaab provided him terrorist training. He was  detained in Somaliland in 2011 and deported to the UK. According to the court documents, he was involved in facilitating travel for others to Somalia and fund-raising for Al-Shabaab, and was planning attacks potentially against Western interests in Somaliland before his arrest. He remains wanted by British security. It's unknown if Magag or Mohamed rekindled their ties with Emwazi in London before leaving the country. In 2013, Emwazi himself traveled to Syria, joined ISIS, and began guarding Western hostages. In August 2014 he was dubbed \"Jihadi John\" -- the menacing, taunting, hooded face of ISIS -- when he orchestrated the brutal beheading of American journalist James Foley, the first of many victims murdered on camera.","highlights":"The man now known as \"Jihadi John\" was on Britain's terror radar for several years .\nCourt documents claim he was a member of a terror recruitment network in London .\nThe papers spell out his connections to other known terrorists in Somalia ."}
{"article":"Barrington, New Hampshire (CNN)U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz was delivering his normal rhetoric during a New Hampshire speech on Sunday, hitting the current administration on the economy, Obamacare and national security. \"And the Obama-Clinton foreign policy of leading from behind -- the whole world is on fire,\" the senator from Texas declared. But he was stopped by a 3-year-old girl sitting in the front row. \"The world is on fire?\" she yelled out. Cruz took it and ran with it. \"The world is on fire -- yes! Your world is on fire,\" he exclaimed, seizing the moment as the crowd burst out into laughter. \"But you know what? Your mommy's here and everyone's here to make sure that the world you grow up in is even better.\" The scene -- while cute -- captured Cruz's determination to remain unwavering in his views and language, never backtracking. There was no \"just kidding\" or \"that was only a metaphor\" to assuage the little girl. Instead, the first-term senator continued with his speechifying and used the moment to illustrate his point that while things are bad now, they could get better -- especially, cough cough, if he becomes president. A woman who identified herself as the child's mother named Michelle later told the WRKO's Kuhner Report that her child's reaction came in a \"high question kind of voice,\" but that her daughter was \"quite happy\" in the aftermath. \"She really, basically was like 'oh, oh, this is a great man.' He's the firefighter in her mind as a three-year-old. And was quite happy and she wanted a cookie.\" Cruz is bringing the resolute disruptor brand that he's built in Congress out on the trail as he lays the groundwork for a White House bid. This weekend, he was on a two-day swing through New Hampshire, stopping Sunday afternoon at an event put on by the Strafford County GOP. In the same way Cruz challenges establishment Republicans in the Senate, he's trying to build a campaign that breaks from the mold and showcases his firebrand conservatism. For example, his first question from the audience came from a woman who wanted to know how Cruz was going to make campaign finance reform a reality, a huge issue in the first-in-the-nation primary state. But Cruz argued that not only is money a form of speech, it emboldens speech. \"The answer is not to muzzle citizens; it's to empower citizens across the country,\" he said. Throwing a bone to his questioner, however, he said he supports requiring that campaign donations be disclosed. He took the same steadfast approach last weekend in Iowa, when he and other contenders were asked about the ethanol mandate requiring that gasoline contain a certain amount of ethanol -- a popular regulation in Iowa where corn is king. While nearly every other potential candidate expressed at least some measure of support for the mandate, Cruz flatly opposed it, saying in front of close to a thousand Iowa farmers that he doesn't think the government should be involved in the private sector. Gov. Scott Walker, who's vying with Jeb Bush for frontrunner status, said he supported the mandate in Iowa, despite previously opposing it in his home state of Wisconsin . Asked by reporters Sunday about accusations that Walker is a flip-flopper, Cruz first praised his potential rival but made sure to mention that candidates need to be challenged on their actions. \"It's easy for candidates to give an answer,\" he said, but added: \"The proof is in the pudding. What I've urged Republicans to ask of every candidate is: Have you walked the walk? Show me your record.\" Cruz got heavy applause when he said he wanted to \"repeal every word of Common Core,\" a set of testing standards that Jeb Bush staunchly defended when he appeared at a nearby event in Dover, New Hampshire just two days earlier. Common Core, however, was not legislation approved by Congress. Rather, it was created by a bipartisan group of governors and state leaders, and states received financial incentives by the government to adopt the standards. Still, Cruz played somewhat coy with his White House aspirations, aware of the tight federal regulations that would start holding contenders to different standards once they admit they're running for president. When voters pressed him Sunday to make a White House bid, Cruz told them to \"stay tuned.\" \"I'm looking at it very, very seriously,\" he told the audience. \"I would point out a week ago I was in Iowa, yesterday I was in South Carolina, and today I'm in New Hampshire.\" But he truly charmed the crowd when he said that after he and his wife got their daughters a puppy recently, one of the girls gave her approval for Cruz's presidential aspirations. \"If you win, that means Snowflake will finally get a backyard to pee in,\" his daughter said, according to Cruz. In terms of energy and turnout, Sunday's event stood out from other events held by potential White House contenders who were in New Hampshire this weekend, in part because it was open to the public, unlike other events headlined by Walker and Bush. His remarks were met with boisterous applause, and he was frequently urged to run for president by people who shook his hand before and after the event. Halfway through Cruz's remarks, a small-business owner in the audience was called on to ask a question but instead stood up proudly next to the senator and went off into a two-minute rant about how other Republicans in Washington aren't representing their conservative constituents. \"It is D-Day in America folks,\" he said, getting the crowd on their feet. \"We can't wait for another Republican. We need Ted Cruz.\" The man said his wife wrote a blank check for Cruz and pulled out his wallet, only to throw it on the ground at Cruz's feet. \"For those who believe in miracles, this gentleman just threw his wallet at a politician,\" Cruz said, getting a big laugh from the crowd. \"And he actually got it back.\" Cruz could not accept the money because he's not yet a candidate. One man, Bill Higgins, stood outside in the snow for four hours hoping Cruz would meet his goat named Izak, an apparent fixture on the campaign trail which was wearing a hat that said \"I voted\" and who happened to bite Jon Huntsman in 2011. Cruz waved hello at Higgins as the senator exited the building Sunday afternoon but didn't stop to greet the goat. \"He'll be back again,\" Higgins said, trying to appear unfazed. \"I'm sure he wants to get to his next stop.\"","highlights":"U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz visits New Hampshire, hits the White House on economy and Obamacare .\nA little girl in the crowd thinks the rhetorically speaking senator is warning of a literal global conflagration .\nMeanwhile, a goat that once bit Jon Huntsman doesn't get the same chance with the Texas senator ."}
{"article":"(CNN)The governor of Virginia has ordered an investigation after a black student at the University of Virginia was injured during an arrest early Wednesday. The university's Black Student Alliance distributed a photograph, showing what it said was Martese Johnson, 20, during his arrest. Blood splatters his shirt and covers his face. Video from the incident shows Johnson pinned to the ground, screaming: \"I go to UVA! ... You f****** racists! What the f***? How did this happen?\" An officer can be heard telling the student to stop fighting. On Wednesday night, hundreds of students rallied in support of Johnson. And Johnson himself took the microphone. \"Regardless of your personal opinions and the way you feel about subjects ... please respect everyone here,\" he said. \"We are one community. We deserve to respect each other, especially in times like this.\" Earlier, the Black Student Alliance issued a statement denouncing the incident. \"Today, we are reminded of the gruesome reality that we are not immune to injustice; as University students, we are not impervious to the brutality that has reeled on news cycles around the country,\" the group said. \"We have marched and shouted that we are Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, but the proximity of this morning's brutality to a member of our community has deepened that wound. It is no longer happening only on national television -- it is a reality here and now at the University of Virginia that we must face as a collective,\" it said. People are also speaking out on Twitter where #JusticeForMartese was trending Wednesday evening. The student's name had 16,000 mentions on Twitter in the past 24 hours. According to the Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC), uniformed ABC special agents arrested Johnson after he was refused entry to a licensed establishment and questioned. He was charged with public intoxication and obstruction of justice, ABC said in a statement, adding that Johnson was treated for his injuries at a local hospital and released. In a separate statement, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said that he has asked the Secretary of Public Safety to open an independent Virginia State Police investigation into the use of force. The special agents involved in the incident will be restricted to administrative duties, pending the results of the investigation. Johnson is a third-year student double majoring in Italian and media studies. He has no criminal record, according to his attorney, and holds a variety of leadership positions on campus. \"As evidenced by both his academic and extracurricular achievements, Martese is a smart young man with a bright future,\" attorney Daniel P. Watkins said. \"I have spoken with him several times today, and he is absolutely devastated by yesterday's events. Currently, we are preparing to investigate and defend this matter vigorously.\" The president of the University of Virginia urged anyone who witnessed the arrest, or who has information about it, to contact authorities. \"We have not yet clarified all of the details surrounding this event, but we are seeking to do so as quickly as possible,\" said Teresa A. Sullivan. \"Today, as U.Va. students, faculty, and staff who share a set of deeply held values, we stand unified in our commitment to seeking the truth about this incident. And we stand united in our belief that equal treatment and equal justice are among our fundamental rights under the law.\" CNN's Patrick Cornell contributed to this report.","highlights":"Martese Johnson: \"We are one community.

{"article":"(CNN)\"This is going to be a test for Serena Williams. We're going to find out what she's made of. How mentally tough she really is.\" Those were the words of tennis analyst Mary Joe Fernandez in 2001, early into Serena Williams' decider with Kim Clijsters in the final of one of tennis' most prestigious tournaments. The match was being televised on one of the biggest sports networks in the world, ESPN. The then 17-year-old Clijsters had just held to love amid vociferous cheers and -- in a breach of tennis etiquette -- a large portion of the fans on center court at the event now known as the BNP Paribas Open roared approvingly when Williams struck a double fault to begin the next game. Despite Williams growing up about 130 miles away in a suburb of Los Angeles, while Clijsters hailed from Belgium, there was clearly no home-court advantage. Williams' father, Richard, and older sister, Venus, were booed as they made their way to their seats prior to the finale, with Richard claiming in USA Today he was the victim of racial abuse. Venus Williams, meanwhile, said in a press conference at her next tournament she \"heard whatever he heard.\" It was Richard Williams who shaped his daughters into grand slam winners from a humble background, bereft of the type of money used to help manufacture many a champion. \"One guy said, 'I wish it was '75, we'd skin you alive,'\" Richard Williams told USA Today. \"I had trouble holding back tears. I think Indian Wells disgraced America.\" Charlie Pasarell, then the tournament director, said in the same story that he didn't discount Richard Williams was racially abused. CNN.com did not hear back from Pasarell when it put in an interview request for him and Clijsters declined an interview request. The fans' reaction apparently stemmed from the sisters' semifinal -- or lack of it. Venus Williams pulled out a mere minutes prior to the start, citing a knee injury. Whispers of Richard Williams pre-determining the outcome grew, no doubt aided by the comments of Elena Dementieva. After Venus Williams beat Dementieva in the quarterfinals, the Russian said the sisters' father would \"decide\" who won. Serena Williams, who was 19 back then, ultimately passed the 'test' that day against Clijsters, judging by the result: A three-set win. Serena Williams has certainly, too, shown her mental toughness over the years, adding 18 grand slam singles titles to the one she won prior to 2001. But what transpired tarnished the tournament, the sport and hurt one of tennis' all-time greats to such an extent that she stayed away from Indian Wells. Until now. Serena Williams plays her first match in Indian Wells in 14 years on Friday, saying she was \"following her heart\" in deciding to return. In the years that have passed since 2001, Williams went from teen to young adult to veteran, all the while collecting major titles elsewhere. \"It has been difficult for me to forget spending hours crying in the Indian Wells locker room after winning in 2001, driving back to Los Angeles feeling as if I had lost the biggest game ever -- not a mere tennis game but a bigger fight for equality,\" Serena Williams told Time.com in February. \"Emotionally it seemed easier to stay away. \"There are some who say I should never go back. There are others who say I should've returned years ago. I understand both perspectives very well and wrestled with them for a long time. \"I'm just following my heart on this one.\" Raymond Moore, a former owner of the tournament and now its chief executive, was \"elated\" to have Serena Williams back in the field. \"In the past, the things that happened, there were no winners,\" Moore told CNN.com. \"I think it was a terrible incident. Regrettable from all sides. Now, Serena has been able to change that. We're grateful, excited and happy and we're going to welcome her with open arms. \"In terms of her reception, I would like her to be here feeling that her decision was received with the greatest and warmest reception possible.\" But Serena Williams will be the lone Grand Slam winner in her family attending. Serena speaks about nerves before 1st match back at Indian Wells . Even with the best efforts of the tournament -- now owned by billionaire Larry Ellison -- Venus Williams is continuing her boycott, as is Richard Williams, according to Moore. The siblings' mom, Oracene Price, will be alongside Serena Williams, though, added Moore. Serena Williams told reporters in Indian Wells on Thursday that her father, mother and Venus Williams gave her their blessing when she contemplated coming back to Indian Wells. \"We wanted to get Venus,\" said Moore. \"In fact we'd like to welcome the whole family. But Venus I think is not quite in the same place as Serena is. And so we've not been successful in enticing her to enter or take a wild card. \"But Oracene is coming and so are some other family members.\" Serena Williams scoffed at suggestions that the sisters' match in Indian Wells -- or any other between them -- was fixed. \"Throughout my whole career, integrity has been everything to me,\" she told Time. \"It is also everything and more to Venus. The false allegations that our matches were fixed hurt, cut and ripped into us deeply. \"The under-current of racism was painful, confusing and unfair. In a game I loved with all my heart, at one of my most cherished tournaments, I suddenly felt unwelcome, alone and afraid.\" Reflecting on the incident, Bart McGuire, the chief executive of the women's tour in 2001, said Venus Williams had been suffering from a genuine injury and that the notion that Richard Williams dictated the outcome of matches between his daughters was off the mark. But he admitted things could have been handled better. Venus Williams, for example, might have explained her withdrawal to fans on court and then signed autographs, he said, citing the example of last year's World Tour Finals. Roger Federer withdrew from the final in London -- but not before he addressed fans and signed autographs. What happened in the final between Serena Williams and Clijsters was awful, said McGuire. \"I thought it was horrible,\" he told CNN.com. \"I thought it was very tough on the players. \"By that time I'd known enough to know that Venus had been significantly injured and that it was not a set-up of any kind. I thought it was unfair to Serena and Kim.\" Serena Williams is twice a champion at the tournament and winning this year would be \"fantastic,\" said Moore. But even if not, he added: \"I think it's a wonderful ending in closing an ugly chapter. We're just looking forward, we're not looking backward.\"","highlights":"Serena Williams makes her return to Indian Wells on Friday .\nShe hasn't played at the tournament since 2001 .\nHer dad said he was racially abused at the tournament in 2001 .\nVenus Williams still has not returned to the California event ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Thousands of Singaporeans gathered in pouring rain Sunday to bid farewell to Lee Kuan Yew, the Southeast Asian city-state's founding prime minister who charted its spectacular economic rise. Draped in the national flag, Lee's coffin was taken on a solemn procession through the sodden streets of the tropical city, where crowds of mourners defied the downpour to pay their last respects. The funeral service was attended by dozens of foreign dignitaries, including former U.S. President Bill Clinton and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. \"The light that has guided us all these years has been extinguished. We have lost our founding father Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, who lived and breathed Singapore all his life,\" Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is one of Lee's sons, said in a eulogy. Lee died early Monday morning at age 91, prompting an outpouring of grief and tributes from around the world. He had been admitted to the hospital with pneumonia on February 5. Born in 1923, Lee co-founded Singapore, a former British colony, in 1965 when it declared its independence from Malaysia. He served as its prime minister for more than three decades, shaping the once poor trading post into a wealthy financial center. He continued to play an important role in government until his final years. After Lee's death, hundreds of thousands of people joined huge lines to pay respects to the former leader as his body lay in state at Singapore's Parliament House for several days last week. The procession Sunday weaved past a number of notable Singapore landmarks on the way to the University Cultural Centre, where the state funeral service took place. \"Together, we came not only to mourn. Together, we celebrate Mr. Lee Kuan Yew's long and full life, and what he has achieved with us, his people,\" his son said in his eulogy. Lee was also honored by a 21-gun salute and a minute of silence, as well as displays by the Singapore Air Force and the Singapore Navy. The funeral service was to be followed by a private cremation. Other international figures attending the funeral included Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Leader of the U.K. House of Commons William Hague and former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Although Lee is admired for the economic success he helped Singapore achieve, he also drew criticism for curbing media freedoms and the treatment of political opponents. \"While remembering his deeds that helped build Singapore up to what it is today, the government should also mark the passing of Lee Kuan Yew, by making a break from the politics of yesteryear that were too often marked by restrictions on basic civil and political rights,\" Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division, said in a statement Sunday.","highlights":"\"The light that has guided us all these years has been extinguished,\" Lee's son says .\nCrowds line the streets fo the city-state to pay final respects to Lee, who died Monday ."}
{"article":"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers insists he is 'relaxed' about Raheem Sterling's contract situation despite claims that the latest discussions have failed to find a solution to a long-running impasse. The club have tabled what a couple of weeks ago Rodgers described as an 'incredible' offer - reported to be in the region of \u00a3100,000 a week. A few weeks before that the Reds boss had suggested an agreement was imminent but latest reports suggest there has been no movement in negotiations. Raheem Sterling has still not penned a new deal despite being reportedly offered \u00a3100,000-a-week . Reds manager Brendan Rodgers (left) insists he is 'relaxed' about the situation .

Sterling has been locked in talks over a contract extension for several months but the 20-year-old has told club officials he wants to focus on the remainder of Liverpool\u2019s Premier League season and on winning the FA Cup. Given Sterling\u2019s status as one of Europe\u2019s top emerging talents, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are watching on closely. Likewise, Premier League clubs will also enter the race if it becomes clear Sterling is available. Nonetheless, Rodgers claims he is not overly concerned by the current situation. 'There is nothing new to report on it. I am quite relaxed about Raheem's situation,' he said. 'He is not going anywhere in a hurry - he has still got this season and another couple of years to go on his contract. 'I think it is quite obvious when you look at Raheem's situation anyone with Raheem's best interests would see Liverpool as the best option for his career. The Jamaican-born winger has scored 10 goals in all competitions this season . Rodgers had previously claimed that the club would not be held to ransom by the player's agent . 'He turned 20 in December and he has made 114 appearances, which is a remarkable amount at a club of this size to be given that opportunity. 'He has made it clear himself that he loves being here and I think he was quoted as saying this is the best place for any young player to develop, so that makes me quite relaxed. 'I am sure the club and his representatives will find the solution for that.' Rodgers has previously suggested the club would not be held to ransom by Sterling's agent and said the contract offer they had made was more than fair for a player of the England international's age and potential. Asked why he thought a deal had not been agreed yet, the manager said: 'I'm not sure. It is not in my area really. 'I speak to Raheem about his football and concentrate on his football and see what goes from there.' Sterling and Jordan Henderson, who has been captaining the side in the absence of the injured Steven Gerrard, are the two players whose contracts appear to be taking most of the headlines. Sterling trains with captain Steven Gerrard (right) who has recovered from a spell out with a hamstring injury . However, with Liverpool closing in on a top-four place and having one eye on a possible FA Cup final, it is imperative they do not allow off-field issues to distract them. Rodgers is confident neither player will drop their standards as he believes they are both focused on the job in hand. 'These are two players who want to ensure they are here for the future,' he added. 'The model of this club is to develop the talent and create world-class players and then, of course, it is important we keep those - especially when they are here already - and that is something we are working hard to do. 'The players are working well, they are concentrated, and that side of it they have to leave to their representatives and the club so we'll just focus on the football. 'It is never easy but there are players, with all due respect, in League Two and League One who are working on six-month or one-year contracts.

{"article":"(CNN)When Chinese photographer Wang Wenlan first pressed the shutter on a borrowed Soviet camera in 1967, he was a teenager taking photos to kill time during Chairman Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution. \"I made rolls of film out of a motion-picture reel I found. The photographic paper was left over from printing Mao's portraits,\" Wang told CNN. Five decades later, Wang, 61, is one of the country's top photojournalists. His work is a rich chronicle of China's fast-changing society. \"Still images are fragments, sections and points that connect the history,\" Wang says. \"The whole process of China's reform over the past four decades -- whether going forward or stalling -- I've been determined to and have managed to document it all.\" One of his most famous series of photographs tracks China's relationship with the bicycle -- once a family's most precious asset but now fast vanishing from the streets. Photography was an outlet for Wang during the dark days of the Cultural Revolution, when China was convulsed by violent class struggle. His family were labeled \"capitalist roaders\" and unlike most other kids, he couldn't join the red guards. Despondent, 14-year-old Wang wandered around Beijing with friends in similar situations, snapping pictures and portraits to distract himself. Taking photos turned into more than a pastime in January 1976, when Premier Zhou Enlai died - beloved by many for his role in tempering the worst of Mao's excesses. Wang went to Tiananmen Square with his camera, capturing the unprompted outpouring of grief, both then, and again in April that year. \"I was in deep grief,\" Wang said, \"And I felt I should record the collective grief.\" He kept the film secret from the military, which then employed him as a photographer, transferring it to friends. The photos were published in the early 1980s. From then on, Wang saw that his camera was much more than a memory keeper. \"I didn't get photojournalism until then,\" he said. \"My biggest regret was not to capture anything meaningful during the Cultural Revolution period; it would've been a precious record.\" In the decades following, Wang has photographed not only major events -- from Tangshan Earthquake in 1976 and the overthrow of the Gang of Four, to the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008 -- but also intimate moments captured in China's changing countryside and growing cities. From April 3, Wang will have the first overseas exhibition of his work in the United States at the University of Iowa. Curator Judy Polumbaum -- a Chinese media scholar and former colleague of Wang -- said his work is a great window to examine contemporary China. \"It reflects not only the many changes in Chinese society emerging over the past several decades but also the endurance of tradition, and the often striking and sometimes amusing clashes between tradition and change,\" she said. The clash between tradition and modernity is stark in the lead picture of the exhibit \u2014 an elderly farmer looks on as a groom carries his bride through the field and \"the couple's Western wedding garb contrasting with this longstanding custom,\" she says. Wang has spent most of his career at the China Daily, the country's official English-language paper, which he joined in 1980 before its official launch. Back then, it broke the mold, using large photographs rather than the stamp-sized images used in most other Chinese newspapers at the time, he says. It was also unafraid to feature ordinary people on its pages, rather than national leaders -- something Wang found he excelled at. \"Thanks to the China Daily, I stood out. It was an irreplaceable platform.\" Wang finds himself nostalgic for the 1980s, when ideas emerged and collided after the Cultural Revolution ended. \"People thought nothing was impossible,\" he said. \"We reflected on the past and were determined to move on. It was a special time; the air was filled with ideals, enthusiasm and all kinds of possibilities.\" Today's China is different,  he said. \"The country's goal has shifted toward a transition to a market economy since the 1990s,\" he said. \"Individuals also have since switched their focus onto consumerism and incomes from ideals.\" Throughout his career, Wang's focus has changed a great deal as well. He said he used to focus on the technical and artistic aspects of photography, but now, with smart phones, he says anyone can be a photographer. To Wang, what matters is the perspective, he said, pointing at his head. Wang says he's felt obligated to observe and criticize through his lens over the years. \"My job isn't to chant slogans.\" \"I take photos first. It's great if they can be published; if not, they'll eventually be part of the history.\" Next year will mark Wang's 40th year in photojournalism. He is planning to have a photo exhibition and wants to call it \"Unfinished.\" The name was inspired by the alternative title of Franz Schubert's Symphony No.8. \"China is unfinished,\" said Wang, who is also fan and critic of classic music. \"It's always a work in progress.\"","highlights":"Wang Wenlan has been a photojournalist in China for almost four decades .\nHis work is a great window to examine contemporary China .\nHis most famous series of photographs tracks China's relationship with the bicycle ."}

In a statement released through the Food and Drug Administration on Sunday, Amy's Kitchen said that it was voluntarily recalling the products after learning from one of its suppliers that it may have received organic spinach that was possibly contaminated with listeria monocytogenes. The California-based organic and natural food company said it wasn't aware of any reports of illness connected with its products, but was recalling them \"out of an abundance of caution.\" The recalled products, which are listed on the FDA's website and were distributed throughout the United States and Canada, include multiple types of vegetable lasagna, tofu scrambles, spinach pizza, enchiladas, brown rice and vegetable bowls and stuffed pasta shells. Listeriosis, a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with listeria, primarily affects the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and people with weakened immune systems, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the United States, an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill each year; approximately 16% of these illnesses result in death. Cervical infections caused by listeriosis in pregnant women may result in spontaneous abortion during the second or third trimesters or stillbirth.

{"article":"Beijing (CNN)When it came to the environment in China, it was hazy through much of the weekend -- literally and figuratively. As a thick layer of toxic air blanketed Beijing and much of northern China on Friday, censors smothered a wildly popular but controversial documentary on the country's air pollution, removing it from all major video streaming sites. At a standing-room-only press conference Saturday, the newly appointed minister of environmental protection ignored raised hands of foreign journalists eager to ask about the development and made no mention of the documentary that he had praised just a week earlier. Without a hint of irony, he promised to be more transparent and reassured the masses of their right to oversee the government's fight against air pollution. \"Under the Dome\" -- a slickly produced two-hour documentary on journalist Chai Jing's dogged quest to find the causes and solutions to China's severe smog problem -- attracted over 200 million views online in just one week, an unprecedented number even in the world's most populous nation. Supporters and detractors of Chai, a famous former anchor and reporter at state-run national broadcaster CCTV, began a war of words almost immediately after the video's release on February 28. Admirers compared it to \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" the Oscar-winning documentary on former U.S. Vice President Al Gore's effort to raise awareness on the dangers of global warming. Critics, on the other hand, portrayed it as a piece of shoddy investigative journalism filled with bad science and biased conclusions, which blamed the problem largely on the entrenched interests of the state oil industry. Some even called it propaganda for President Xi Jinping, who had declared keeping the sky blue a top policy priority. The new environment minister's initial response to the video -- in the form of a widely reported text message of gratitude to Chai -- reinforced some doubts over Chai's claim of editorial independence for her self-funded project. Many more people, however, perceived it as an encouraging sign of the government's adoption of a more open attitude to a politically sensitive topic, as Xi and other leaders started to publicly acknowledge the severity and urgency of the issue. But such optimism was dashed 24 hours after the documentary's launch, as censors moved to reign in increasingly heated online debates surrounding air pollution and beyond, and removed all mention of the video from homepages of major websites. As the week progressed, leaked state media memos -- widely circulated on social media -- revealed ever-harsher wording from propaganda authorities as they scrambled to limit the continuing impact of the video. Finally, after millions of clicks, \"Under the Dome\" vanished from much of Chinese cyberspace Friday as heavy smog descended on the capital. Also in Beijing were almost 3,000 delegates who had gathered to attend the National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp parliament that meets in full once a year to approve the ruling Communist Party's legislative proposals. Pollution has remained a hot topic at this year's session, state-run Xinhua news agency reported, adding that Xi vowed to legislators Friday \"to give an iron hand to any polluters in the smog-choked country.\" With Chai's viral video also encountering an iron hand, analysts explained that the seeming contradiction makes perfect sense in a one-party dictatorship with little tolerance for open dissent. \"Smog is like any other problem in China -- dig it too deep and you touch the issue of political system,\" said Yao Bo, a well-known news commentator with more than 1.2 million followers on Chinese social media. \"The video doesn't do that but comments on it had started to question the system.\" \"I think the video caught censors off guard,\" he added, dismissing the idea that its fate reflected infighting among China's senior leaders. \"The censors eventually acted as expected, after going through this bureaucratic process that is always half a step behind.\" As gusty winds blew away Beijing's smog Sunday afternoon, this much became clear to the public: In China, the government cares about the environment as much as you do, but only one of you is free to talk about it.","highlights":"Film on China's air pollution problem drew praise from environment minister when it came out .\nA week later, after getting millions of clicks, \"Under the Dome\" disappeared from all major websites in China ."}
{"article":"(CNN)There's been plenty of talk lately about how dangerous stereotypes can be when it comes to the empowerment of our girls and young women. For instance, the #LikeAGirl campaign, which took a hammer to the notion that doing anything \"like a girl\" should be viewed as an insult, has become an international sensation. Less discussed, though, is the reality that our boys face damaging stereotypes too. That was the motivation behind a recent workshop held by SheKnows Media, a leading women's lifestyle media company. A group of New York City tween boys ranging in age from 8 to 10 got together as part of the company's Hatch program, which focuses on teaching digital literacy and citizenship to the next generation. The boys were shown dozens of advertisements perpetuating hypermasculine stereotypes, such as images of men all muscled up and not wearing shirts. In one ad for a big truck, the boys heard the tag line \"Can a truck change how people feel about a guy?\" Is the 'be a man' stereotype hurting boys? Another advertisement, this one for a clothing company, showed a man from the waist down along with the caption \"Wear the pants.\" \"That's a man wearing the pants so that shows that men are in charge,\" said one of the boys, who's 9. What was clear was that this group of boys knew what the advertisers were trying to get them to think, but they weren't exactly buying it. \"I play with girl toys and boy toys. I don't really care which one is meant for boys or for girls. I just play with them. They're toys,\" said another boy, also 9. \"Man up\" might mean toughen up and be unemotional, said another boy, who added that his image of what a man should be is completely different. \"If I were to describe the perfect man, the words would be smart, not judgy, and kind,\" said the 10-year-old. 'Dad' gets a makeover in Super Bowl ads . These boys certainly can't speak for all tween boys, but their comments reflect what appears to be growing attention surrounding the use of gender stereotypes for boys as well as girls. Seventy-six percent of men who took part in a recent online survey by SheKnows Media admitted using phrases like \"man up\" and \"be a man\" toward boys. Of the more than 1200 men and women surveyed from across the country, 73% said boys are most often described as \"aggressive,\" 69% said \"strong\" and 53% said \"athletic.\" When the men were asked about stereotypes during their teen years, 72% said they became aware of physical attractiveness and 50% said they grew more conscious about weight. Kids as young as 5 concerned about body image . The awareness starts even earlier, according to a recent analysis of existing research on kids and body image by Common Sense Media, a child advocacy group. It found that over a third of boys ages 6 to 8 think their ideal weight should be thinner than their current body weight. \"These are problems that are often thought of as problems for girls, but boys are just as impacted and they're exposed to unrealistic body images,\" said Ellen Pack, vice president of marketing for Common Sense Media, which is partnering with SheKnows Media to help parents understand the impact that media and technology are having on children. \"The proportion of undressed males in advertising has been steadily on the rise since the 1980s,\" said Pack. \"The same kinds of inappropriate messages that we're giving to our girls, we're giving to our boys too -- that they don't measure up, that they're not adequate.\" At the same time, there does appear to be more open-mindedness on what being masculine means to men and boys today, based on the poll's findings. Of the men surveyed by SheKnows, 78% said it was OK for boys to cry, 65% thought it was fine for boys to wear pink, and 55% of men said boys should be able to play dress-up. \"You should be able to do your own things and do what you want,\" said one of the boys, who is 8. Sheryl Sandberg teams up with the NBA to get men to lean in . The takeaway for parents is that they, more than anyone or anything else, influence the stereotypes their boys will encounter and what impact those stereotypes will ultimately have on them. \"We found the single most significant driver of their perception of what's OK for boys was their parents,\" said Samantha Skey, chief marketing officer for SheKnows Media. \"It wasn't pop culture or Adam Levine or Usher. It was their parents,\" she said. \"If their parents think they're strong and appropriately masculine, then they are. Period.\" Pack, of Common Sense Media, says parents should be talking about the issue to their boys when they are young, even as young as 5, and should call out stereotypes when they see them. \"Don't just turn your eyes. Use it as an opportunity to engage in a conversation with your kids and challenge assumptions,\" Pack said. \"When you are seeing things on TV that you think are unrealistic, point it out.\" I, for one, wish we could wipe out \"be a man\" and \"man up\" from all of our vocabularies. But, actually, why do we need to remove the language? We just need to change what it means. The tweens involved in the Hatch workshop offer some real-life evidence that that may be already happening. \"When you go your own way, it feels good because you feel free and you can do what you want to do, and you don't have to do what other people say,\" one of the boys said. What do you think is the best way to empower boys and young men to tune out negative gender stereotypes?

{"article":"The Football Association has written to Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion over what the governing body calls \u2018disturbing crowd incidents\u2019 during Saturday\u2019s shameful FA Cup tie. In a statement the FA says all video footage will be studied to identify culprits and \u2018ensure they face appropriate punishment\u2019. Tony Pulis has called for West Brom fans found guilty of ripping up seats at Villa Park to receive lifetime bans, while similar sanctions are likely to befall home fans who goaded and shoved opposition players. Police clash with unruly fans in the aftermath of the FA Cup clash between Aston Villa and West Brom . The national lead officer for football policing has questioned the scheduling of the match on Saturday night . Villa face the prospect of a significant fine for failing to control their fans over three pitch invasions and the FA will want to establish whether any negligence was the cause. Villa have already issued an unreserved apology over the scenes at the end of a game which saw 17 people arrested overall. An FA statement read: \u2018The FA has contacted both Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion to request their observations in relation to the disturbing crowd incidents which occurred during and after their FA Cup quarter-final tie on 7 March 2015. \u2018As well as liaising with both clubs, The FA is working closely with West Midlands Police and notes that a number of arrests have already been made. \u2018All available video footage will be studied by the relevant parties to identify anyone who has committed a disorder offence inside the stadium and ensure they face the appropriate punishment. \u2018Whilst its investigation continues, The FA will make no further comment.\u2019 Aston Villa fans celebrated by racing on to the pitch following their 2-0 victory over West Brom at Villa Park . Police attempt to halt fans who ran on to the pitch after Aston Villa booked their place in the semi-final . A Villa statement read: 'Aston Villa, West Bromwich Albion and West Midlands Police are all working together to investigate events which took place both during and after Saturday's FA Cup match. 'The Club will also cooperate fully with the Football Association. There will be no further comment until all inquiries are complete.\u2019 The national lead officer for football policing questioned the scheduling of the match, which kicked off at 5.30pm. 'Saturday night football is here to stay, we appreciate that, Friday night football is due to be coming in,' he told BBC Radio Five Live. 'When you have these fixtures you have to be careful about which ones you play. All games have potential (for crowd trouble) but clearly some games have more potential than others. 'They are big clubs, not clubs that particularly have a troublesome following but when you have that sort of fixture, late on a weekend in particular, alcohol is a factor. 'If you give people four, five, six hours more drinking time, don't be surprised if in a highly-charged atmosphere, their behaviour isn't good. Villa fans leap over hoardings at full-time, and the decision to play the game at 5.30pm is being questioned . West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill is mocked by an Aston Villa fan following the home side's second goal . 'If you're looking at whether alcohol was a factor, there was disorder at a public house near the ground before the game, people being arrested coming into the ground for being drunk and disorderly, being drunk seeking entry to a football ground. 'If you looked at the people who came onto the pitch, a few of them looked like they were worse for wear from some substance and I don't think there is any coincidence that where there's alcohol involved, people's behaviour tends to deteriorate.' He added: 'I do think there is an issue here for the broadcasters because that game was scheduled for a 5.30 kick-off to meet the BBC's scheduling. 'Broadcasters as well as the football authorities need to start taking these issues seriously. 'What we want is a sensible dialogue so that we schedule the game appropriately. If you look at the four games for the FA Cup quarter-finals this week, you couldn't probably have picked a worse one to have on a Saturday tea-time than a local derby between two big clubs.' The West Brom goalkeeper attempts to make his way safely off the field following the full-time whistle . Scorer Scott Sinclair (second left) is mobbed by a fan and team-mates Ashley Westwood and Jack Grealish . Villa issued an apology for their fans' behaviour while West Brom vowed to take a 'zero tolerance' approach after promising to co-operate fully with the FA inquiry. And Baggies boss Tony Pulis has called for a lifetime ban for any of the club's fans who were found to be responsible for throwing seats. 'If that was the situation, and they've got CCTV cameras up there, those supporters should never come into another football ground. It is like people coming into someone else's house - you have to show respect.' West Brom forward Callum McManaman is escorted off the field after a row with an Aston Villa fan . The pitch at Villa Park can barely be seen s supporters cover practically every blade of grass . Pulis was also concerned about the ease with which spectators were able to get on to the pitch. He added: 'I am old enough to have seen isolated incidents happen like that. I don't want to have a go and take anything away from what happened on the pitch and what happened in the game. 'If one thing, Villa should look at the stewarding because with a game at this time of night, 5.30pm, you need to police it properly, and I am sure Villa will look at it.'","highlights":"Aston Villa fans twice invaded the pitch during their match vs West Brom .\nWest Midlands Police made 17 arrests and the FA are investigating .\nThe FA says it has 'requested the observations' of both clubs .\nThe FA vowed to punish anyone who 'committed a disorder offence'"}

{"article":"(CNN)The white-haired woman's face beams as the camera gets closer to her face. She's sitting on a couch, with a University of Oklahoma shirt draped behind her and a rap song playing in the background. Suddenly, the words spew from her pink-painted lips: \"Ni****, ni****, ni****, ni****, ni****, ni****, ni*****!\" The release of the Vine video, featuring the house mother of the campus' Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter, couldn't come at a worse time -- just days after video surfaced of frat members singing a racist song. But Beauton Gilbow, the fraternity's house mother, insists she's not racist. And two black alumni of the fraternity house agree with the woman they call \"Mom B.\" \"I have been made aware that a video of me that is circulating on social media and in the news,\" Gilbow said in a statement. \"I am heartbroken by the portrayal that I am in some way racist. I have friends of all race and do not tolerate any form of discrimination in my life. The song in the background was the sound of \"All Gold Everything\" from Trinidad James -- a black, Atlanta-based rapper. \"I was singing along to a Trinidad song, but completely understand how the video must appear in the context of the events that occurred this week.\" William Bruce James II, the most recent black member at the fraternity chapter, said no one should use the n-word in any context -- even if it's just a song. \"That word needs to die,\" James told CNN Tonight. \"With that being said, I don't believe that Mom B. has hatred in her heart. I was there with her for four years. She took great care of me ...  she cared about me, she cares about my family. She had pictures of me, my wife, my children on the entryway table in that house. Mom B means a lot to me.\" James said he has reached to Mom B. after the Oklahoma Daily newspaper posted the clip, which was shot in 2013. \"I essentially said, 'Hey, don't ever use that word again, even in a song. But from me, you're forgiven.' \" Black OU SAE alumnus: 'They are not my brothers' Jonathon Davis, the first African-American member of the campus' SAE chapter, also defended \"Mom B.\" \"I wouldn't even hesitate for a split second to say that Mom B. is undoubtedly not a racist,\" Davis said. \"I see her as being caught up in the moment. She does like to mix it up socially, and she likes to have fun with the guys and their dates they bring over to the house. And I see this as maybe her getting caught away with the moment.\" OU's Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter unraveled this week after video showed frat brothers singing about excluding black students and alluding to lynching. \"There will never be a ni**** SAE,\" some chanted. \"You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me.

{"article":"Harry Kane will this week be named in the England senior squad by Roy Hodgson with Tottenham team-mate Ryan Mason also poised for a call \u2014 but Charlie Austin may have to wait his turn given the amount of attacking talent at the England boss\u2019s disposal. Kane is leading the charge of new young strikers and the Spurs player has been assured of a promotion from the Under-21s this week. However, that does not mean England don\u2019t want him to play in the European Under-21 Championships in June, which they have a strong chance of winning. Harry Kane, pictured, will hope to be involved in Roy Hodgson's England squad when it is announced this week . Kane will come into the senior squad for this month\u2019s Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania and the friendly against Italy so Hodgson can view him at close hand. But he will be available for Under-21 boss Gareth Southgate in the summer, rather than the senior squad, who have a friendly against Republic of Ireland and a Euro 2016 qualifier in Slovenia in June. Tottenham team-mate Mason may also be considered for his first call-up with Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain unavailable. Michael Carrick is back but has had limited game time at Manchester United. Tottenham midfielder Ryan Mason may also be considered for first call-up by Roy Hodgson . QPR striker Charlie Austin scores against Arsenal at Loftus Road earlier in March in the Premier League . Hodgson is expected to be at Old Trafford for United\u2019s clash with Tottenham on Sunday. Austin is likely to miss the cut, even though Hodgson is impressed by the striker\u2019s rise at QPR.

{"article":"(CNN)Pope Francis, who succeeded a resigning pontiff exactly two years ago, told a Mexican television network Friday that he expects his pontificate will be brief. \"Four or five years,\" he told Televisa. \"I do not know, even two or three. Two have already passed. It is a somewhat vague sensation. Maybe it's like the psychology of the gambler who convinces himself he will lose, so he won't be disappointed and if he wins, is happy. I do not know.\" Francis, who was elected in March 2013 after Pope Benedict XVI stepped down, said his predecessor had reopened a door to more popes emeritus. When asked whether he likes being Pope, he enthusiastically responded: \"I do not mind.\" Francis, 78, said he feels God only wanted him to lead the Roman Catholic Church for a short time \"and nothing more.\" He said that he would not support putting an age limit on the papacy. He also enjoys calling on the Pope Emeritus. \"It's like having a wise grandfather at home. One can seek advice,\" Francis said. Francis made similar retirement comments in August when he praised Benedict for \"his beautiful gesture\" and said he might do the same thing one day. He told Televisa he misses the ability to go out in public without attracting a huge crowd. \"I would like ... to go out one day, without being recognized, and go to a pizzeria for a pizza,\" he said. Also Friday, while at a communal penance service at St. Peter's Basilica, the Pope announced a \"Jubilee of Mercy\" will start in December. The theme will end November 26, 2016, the Vatican said. There have been 26 jubilees since the first in 1300. The  most recent was in 2000. Pope says it's OK to spank children if you don't demean them .

{"article":"Jordan Henderson can become one of the great international players if he starts to add more goals to his game, according to England manager Roy Hodgson. Hodgson believes that the Liverpool midfielder, who takes on Manchester United on Sunday and is tipped to take over the captaincy from Steven Gerrard next season, is only a step away from becoming an exceptional player, with the England manager delighted at Henderson's progress after he was lambasted for picking Henderson for Euro 2012. Hodgson said: 'His rise has been fairly meteoric as well. It wasn't so long ago that I picked him for Euro 2012 and that decision was vilified. People were saying he wasn't getting into the Liverpool team and he was being described as a waste of money. Roy Hodgson believes Jordan Henderson could become one of the great international players . The England manager wants Henderson to start adding more goals to his game . 'Then he went to the Under-21 tournament a year later and got an awful lot of criticism captaining the England Under-21 team. No-one had a good word to say about him. So his rise has been quite meteoric, even though he's been round a long time. 'It's only the last year that people are starting to say: \"Actually, this boy's a good player\". This lad has a lot of qualities. And of course I think, as time goes on, the responsibility he's been given at Liverpool now by Brendan will help him. Liverpool's success will rub off on him as well as he's been an important part of it. 'I think we'll see him get better and better and that's what we hope. He ceratinly has enough qualities that I don't think he needs to be hung up on goal-scoring. He'll always be around the national team for the many other qualities he has. If he starts to add goals as well, then you're talking about someone who is exceptional.' Henderson has scored some crucial goals for Liverpool, including the winner at Swansea . Henderson (right) in training as Liverpool prepare to take on rivals Manchester United on Sunday . And though Hodgson hopes that Henderson does succeed Steven Gerrard as Liverpool captain, he says it won't make any difference to his role in the England team, where he is already considered one of the senior players. 'If Brendan does make him captain, great and we'll all be happy. If he doesn't it won't affect his leadership qualities as far as I'm concerned. He's in our leadership group. He'll still be someone who needs to take on leadership responsibilities when he comes to England. If he does that, coming as Wayne Rooney does, as captain of his club team, that's great. If he doesn't because Brendan chooses someone else that doesn't affect me.'","highlights":"Roy Hodgson believes Jordan Henderson can become an England great .\nEngland manager described Henderson's rise as 'meteoric'\nHenderson has been in excellent form for Liverpool this season ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Earlier this month, Shahindokht Molaverdi, Iran's Vice President for Women and Family Affairs, led an official delegation to the United Nations in New York to attend the 59th session of the Commission on the Status of Women. In her March 11 speech to the commission, Molaverdi said that \"the Islamic Republic of Iran has always had the empowerment of women and improving their status...on its agenda.\" Molaverdi described the significant progress Iranian women have made in education and science, citing unilateral economic sanctions and violence against women as factors that have impeded the full realization of women's rights. There was little in her speech to suggest that domestic factors -- including Iran's laws and policies -- play a significant role in depriving Iranian women of real gender equality and empowerment. Unfortunately, Molaverdi's comments stood in sharp contrast to reality. On the day she delivered her speech, Amnesty International released a report raising concerns about the possible passage of two bills before Iran's parliament that would further restrict women's rights. One would prohibit voluntary sterilization as part of the country's efforts to boost population growth and strengthen the place of what are deemed \"traditional\" families in society. The other would \"further entrench gender-based discrimination, particularly against women who choose not to or are unable to marry or have children,\" Amnesty said. A day later, the U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran, Ahmed Shaheed, released his fourth report to the U.N. Human Rights Council describing the dire state of human rights in the country. His report cited the concerns about gender discrimination that Human Rights Watch and others had raised during Iran's 2014 Universal Periodic Review, a review of every U.N. state's human rights record every four years by the Human Rights Council. The sobering reality, all too familiar to Molaverdi, is that Iranian women face discrimination in many aspects of their lives, ranging from issues related to marriage, divorce, inheritance and child custody, to restrictions on dress and even access to sports stadiums as spectators. The proposed passage of more restrictive legislation in the name of protecting the family is just the latest step in the rollback on women's rights in recent years. To many, the discrepancy between what Molaverdi said in her speech, and what women face in Iran, smacked of diplomatic subterfuge. Activists and journalists rightly responded by highlighting the many violations of women's rights in Iran, and called out Molaverdi for failing to present an accurate and complete picture of the challenges that Iranian women face. Yet there was little acknowledgment by critics of the behind-the-scenes struggle that Molaverdi, who is often an outspoken critic of regressive measures restricting women's rights at home, and many others are waging every day as they try to carve out much-needed space for Iran's beleaguered rights activists. Just two days before the U.N. session, Iran's conservative Kayhan daily, thought to be close to the Office of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, published an article that showed just what Iran's women's rights activists are up against. The author questioned the wisdom of allowing an official delegation to attend events such as the U.N. commission, describing its notion of \"gender equality\" as \"unacceptable to the Islamic Republic.\" The article accused Molaverdi of \"negligence\" for participating in events that could damage Iran's reputation and interests, and accused the 150 or so people who attended the session as representatives of Iranian groups of doing so without full and proper vetting by Iran's security and intelligence agencies. What's striking about Kayhan's attack is that Iran's powerful security and intelligence apparatus has for years acted to repress independent groups, including women's rights activists. Groups like the One Million Signatures Campaign, a grassroots effort designed to operate within the law to collect signatures supporting the repeal of laws that discriminate against women, were targeted as security officials detained their members on spurious \"national security\" grounds. But those hostile to women's rights in Iran remain unrelenting. Anyone who fails, willingly or unknowingly, to heed their threats may face reprisals, as several activists who attempted to attend similar U.N. events in previous years found out. Yet Kayhan's attack also reflects the resilience and adaptability of women's groups in Iran as they continue to challenge the state's monopoly on the women's rights narrative. While Iranian women lost some important legal rights after the 1979 revolution, their social and economic stature increased on average as they gained wider access to education, health care, and birth control. The image of the compromised and submissive woman engendered by Iran's discriminatory legal system bears little resemblance to the private and public lives of many Iranian women today. So while we rightfully condemn the disconnect between what Molaverdi said at the United Nations, and what Iranian women face, let us not lose sight of another reality: the paradox that exists in Iran between the state's regressive laws and policies against women, and the tireless and undaunted drive for change and equality by those who will not be denied. That effort, at the very least, deserves our respect.","highlights":"Faraz Sanei : Women's groups in Iran have remained adaptable .\nThose hostile to women's rights in Iran remain unrelenting, she says ."}
{"article":"(CNN)It was a ding, just a \"minor concussion,\" that got Chris Borland thinking that playing football might not be worth the millions that come with being an NFL player. Borland was a rookie linebacker in his first training camp in August when he got his \"bell rung,\" he told ESPN's \"Outside The Lines.\" What did he do? He kept playing that day, and through an excellent rookie season. But the thought of the permanent damage that might be happening to him kept nagging at him. He talked to his teammates and family, read about concussions and their effects, each day coming closer to the decision that he finally announced this week. At age 24, not even yet in his prime as an NFL player, Borland told his team he was retiring because he was worried about the long-term effects of head trauma. \"I just honestly want to do what's best for my health,\" he told ESPN. \"From what I've researched and what I've experienced, I don't think it's worth the risk. ... I'm concerned that if you wait (until) you have symptoms, it's too late.\" It was after that self-described \"minor concussion\" in the preseason that Borland threw himself into researching what had happened to other football players. In the end he didn't want to leave his teammates in a bind, but, \"I know this is right for me.\" He said teammates' reactions to his retirement were mixed. One of his best friends told him that he was crazy to walk away from the money. Borland, a third-round pick from Wisconsin, had signed a nearly $3 million contract for four seasons with the San Francisco 49ers and banked a $600,000 bonus. The guys who wanted him to come back would say to the 49ers top tackler, \"That's a lot of money. Why don't you get your money and get out,\" Borland recounted to ESPN. The thought made him uncomfortable because he doesn't want to do anything just for a big paycheck. He didn't want to be wrong when it comes to this: \"Who knows how many hits are too many?\" Borland is one of a handful of players to retire young but possibly the first to retire before concussions became an issue for him. He's also now part of a shift in thinking about what repeated head injuries can do to an athlete. Reports show an increasing number of retired NFL players who have suffered concussions developed memory and cognitive issues such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease, depression and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. \"For me, it's wanting to be proactive,\" Borland said. \"I'm concerned that if you wait (until) you have symptoms, it's too late. There are a lot of unknowns. I can't claim that 'X' will happen. \"I just want to live a long, healthy life, and I don't want to have any neurological diseases or die younger than I would otherwise.\" Passionate reactions to his decision came quickly, with many supporting him. Others say that while the move might be smart for Borland, and even encourage other players to speak out and stand up for their health, there will always be plenty of guys eager to replace players like him. Borland told ESPN that he wasn't saying no one should play football. He said youth players and their parents should do things: 1) Get informed about concussions and 2) Never let anyone play . Last August, thousands of former NFL players and their families reached a deal in a class-action suit that called for the NFL to cover the cost of concussion-related compensation, medical exams and medical research for retired players and their families. The suit alleged that the NFL deliberately misled players about scientific data that the medical community had found about the risks associated with concussions.  In July 2014, a federal judge granted preliminary approval to the landmark deal but she has yet to give final approval to the settlement. Chris Dronett was one of the plaintiffs. Her husband, former Denver Bronco Shane Dronett, committed suicide in 2009 when he was 38. After his death, scientists found evidence of CTE in his brain. Borland named three players he said made him rethink a life in the NFL. \"I've thought about what I could accomplish in football, but for me personally, when you read about Mike Webster and Dave Duerson and Ray Easterling, you read all these stories. And to be the type of player I want to be in football, I think I'd have to take on some risks that as a person I don't want to take on,\" he said. Webster had a career with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Kansas City Chiefs from 1974 to 1990. He was the first former NFL player to be diagnosed with CTE. After he retired, he was diagnosed with amnesia, dementia, depression, and bone and muscle pain. He was 50 when he died. Duerson killed himself with a gunshot to the chest. He had sent a text to his family asking that his brain be sent to Boston University School of Medicine, which was researching CTE. BU neurologists confirmed the NFL veteran had the disease. Easterling, who played eight seasons with the Atlanta Falcons, committed suicide in 2012. He apparently suffered dementia. An autopsy revealed he had CTE. Some on social media said Borland's decision made them think about former NFL linebacker Junior Seau. He was 43 when he was found dead with a gunshot wound to the chest. Friends and family members say multiple concussions were to blame for the suicide, but an initial autopsy report found no apparent brain damage. Portions of Seau's brain were sent to the National Institutes of Health, which found \"abnormalities ... that are consistent with a form\" of CTE. He will be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame this summer. The NFL has reported that in 2013, 228 concussions were diagnosed from practices and games. At least 261 were diagnosed the previous year, the league said. In its statement about Borland's retirement, Jeff Miller, the NFL's senior vice president for health and safety, said: \"We respect Chris Borland's decision and wish him all the best. Playing any sport is a personal decision. By any measure, football has never been safer and we continue to make progress with rule changes, safer tackling techniques at all levels of football, and better equipment, protocols and medical care for players.\" Miller added that the league understands there is more work to do to improve player safety. Complaints keep coming. In July of last year, ex-NFL players Christian Ballard and Gregory Westbrooks filed suit against the NFL Players Association, alleging the union withheld information about head injuries. Opinion: Why are these NFLers retiring early? CNN's Jill Martin contributed to this report.","highlights":"Chris Borland tells ESPN that \"I know this is right for me\"\nSan Francisco 49ers linebacker quits, citing players with concussion disorder, says he wants to \"be proactive\"\nSome former players who suffered from conditions related to concussions have committed suicide ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Selma, it seems, is everywhere. The Ava DuVernay film of that name continues to draw audiences and plaudits, while this month marks the 50th anniversary of three pivotal civil rights marches from the Alabama city -- the first two stopped by brute force, the third a triumphant procession to the state capital of Montgomery led by Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph Bunche, Maurice Davis and other activists. Now, the events that seared those marches into the American consciousness are the subject of a photography show at the Steven Kasher Gallery in New York. \"Selma March 1965\" brings together -- for the first time, anywhere -- pictures by three essential witnesses of the civil rights era: James Barker, Spider Martin and the man Kasher calls \"the single greatest civil rights photographer\" -- Charles Moore. The pictures in the gallery above include Moore's work in Selma and from other parts of the South, including some of the riveting, award-winning photos he made in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963. (Two weeks after his Birmingham pictures appeared in a landmark issue of Life magazine, a letter to the editor succinctly captured the elemental power of Moore's work. The Birmingham pictures, wrote a reader from Indiana, were \"superb and bone-chilling.\") \"The quality, the depth, the sense of reality that he brings to the work is unparalleled,\" Kasher said of Moore's civil rights shots. Kasher's own bona fides on the topic, meanwhile, are well-established: He's mounted photography shows on the civil rights movement in 30 different public venues since the mid-1990s. \"It's important to remember that Charles was a white Alabaman,\" Kasher said. \"He was the photographer at the Montgomery Advertiser -- hardly a bastion of integration -- who became very sympathetic to the movement. I knew Charles pretty well, and he had many sides to him -- sides he was able to reconcile and that allowed him to shoot with a deep understanding of so many different points of view. He was not parachuting into these marches and protests in the South. He had roots there and was fully engaged. \"Of course, there are lots of really good pictures of the era by, say, Bruce Davidson, Bob Adelman and others, but they're Northerners -- and I think that shows. There's a sense in many of the photos made in the South by Northern photographers that what they were capturing was somehow exotic. For Charles, this was home.\" At his very best, Moore invested his pictures with an unsettling intimacy. Whether he was chronicling the overt, graphic suppression of human rights or framing a profoundly human moment -- as in his unforgettable shot of bloodied poet Galway Kinnell in Selma -- Moore's photographs often feel as if he was shooting with Robert Capa's famous dictum ringing in his ears: \"If your photographs aren't good enough, you're not close enough.\" Moore was always, always close enough. John Loengard, who was a staff photographer at Life and later the founding picture editor for People magazine and for Life, the monthly, in the late '70s and '80s, calls Selma \"a not particularly dramatic event, photographically.\" He does, however, have high praise for Moore's Birmingham work, specifically, and his legacy in general. \"There's no question that Charlie made some phenomenal pictures,\" said Loengard -- who, incidentally, took one of the most memorable photos of the civil rights era: a Life cover of Medgar Evers' weeping widow and son at the slain activist's funeral in June 1963. \"And he did a terrific job, for example, on a cover story on (Alabama Gov.) George Wallace in the first few months of People.\" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Whatever else Moore might have shot, and however routinely excellent his output over the course of his long career, there's little doubt he'll always be remembered and honored for his work during those fraught years of the early and mid-1960s. \"What's especially significant to me about Charles' civil rights work,\" Kasher said, \"is his clear affinity with nonviolence at the same time that he's depicting the irrationality and brutality of the segregationists. \"In his famous picture of a police dog attacking a black man in Birmingham in '63, for example, the figure in the photo is a perfect symbol of nonviolence. You know, the man is standing there, taking it, not fighting back, amid this incredible rush of hatred and violence and as another dog is charging right at Moore's -- at the viewer's -- face. It's a terribly complex image, swirling with information, but in the middle of it is this unmistakable emblem of the movement -- an emblem of the power and bravery of civil disobedience.\" Charles Moore was an American photographer known for his images documenting the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Some of his photos are included in \"Selma March 1965,\" a photography show taking place at New York's Steven Kasher Gallery from March 5 to April 18.","highlights":"The Steven Kasher Gallery will be showing powerful photos from the 1965 Selma marches .\nIncluded are images from the late Charles Moore, whose civil rights work is legendary ."}

The 65-year-old must now wrap his head around how Arsenal were eliminated from the Champions League in the last 16 for the fifth year running, despite a 2-0 win against his former club that left it 3-3 on aggregate. Wenger's return to Monaco was not as romantic as he would have liked as no banners were unfurled at the Stade Louis II and few pleasantries were exchanged during a match that saw Arsenal win the battle, but lose the war.

Arsenal's exit on away goals means Wenger must now  focus on qualifying for next year's competition and little can be made in mitigation for being denied a place in the quarter-finals by a team sitting fourth in Ligue 1. 'We have gone out in the last 16 in the last four years, but twice against the future winners,' Wenger said ahead of the match, though it would take some doing for Leonardo Jardim's Monaco to become the third eventual European champions to boot Arsenal out. Wenger is sure to analyse his team's exit and it was in that same interview with\u00a0Monaco-Matin some 27 years ago that he revealed his habit for making sure he watches at least half an hour of football every evening, among other interests. 'I read a lot, all sorts of books because you have to be conversant in a larger and larger amount of things,' the then-Monaco manager  said in 1988. 'For example, I follow closely what is being released in the book store, be it in French, in German or in English. I take notes by hand. I do not know how to type. I have watched a lot of matches. 'This is part of continuing to grow [as a manager]. You take a step back from your football and you analyse the practices elsewhere. 'I have at least 250 [video cassettes]. Every evening, at home, I watch a game for about half an hour.\u00a0Often, it is the opponent that we are about to play, sometimes, it is just for enjoyment. Bayern [Munich] vs Real [Madrid] for example.' Watching this match will not make for pleasant viewing for Wenger, however, as his first competitive return to a city famous for its casino and where one in three people are millionaires saw Arsenal leave empty-handed.

{"article":"Jerusalem  (CNN)Benjamin Netanyahu appears poised to keep his job as Israel's Prime Minister, declaring victory Wednesday following a bitter campaign punctuated by his last-minute appeals to right-wing voters. For weeks, Netanyahu's Likud party trailed in opinion polls to the Zionist Union alliance that characterized him as a divisive leader not up to the task of making the lives of ordinary Israelis better. Those polls turned out to be wrong. Instead, the Likud party grabbed at least 29 of the 120 seats in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, according to unofficial numbers from the Israeli election committee, based on 99% of the vote. Its leaders will have the first chance at forming a coalition government. The Zionist Union came in second, with at least 24 seats. \"Against all odds, against all odds, we achieved this huge victory for Likud,\" Netanyahu told jubilant supporters not long after the polls closed Tuesday. \"We achieved the huge victory for our people.  And I am proud, I am proud for the people of Israel that in the moment of truth, knew to make the right decision and to choose the real material things over immaterial things.\" Rather than courting voters in the middle, Netanyahu pivoted more to the right with appeals concerning Israel's security. Two weeks ago, he made a controversial speech to the U.S. Congress warning of any deal with Iran on its nuclear program. Then, a few days ago, he declared there would be no Palestinian state so long as he's Prime Minister -- reversing an earlier position and putting him at odds again with the Obama administration's support for a two-state solution. On Tuesday, he released a video on Facebook claiming leftists were bringing \"huge amounts\" of Arabs by bus to vote against Likud. Arabs make up about 20% of Israel's population. \"The right regime is in danger,\" Netanyahu said. \"We have an urgent wake-up call. Bring your friends, bring your family, vote for Likud.\" Those appeals appear \"to have energized that right-wing base,\" according to CNN's Elise Labott. Netanyahu still has to form a new government, a process that President Reuven Rivlin said he hopes will start Sunday. If the Likud leader does so -- as expected -- it will leave Israel not much different than it was before the election, with a conservative Netanyahu still the dominant force facing a dug-in opposition. 5 questions about Netanyahu's apparent victory . Isaac Herzog, who led the Zionist Union, called Netanyahu to concede defeat. But he and fellow opposition leader Tzipi Livni won't go away, with Herzog insisting that \"nothing has changed.\" \"This is not the time for coalitions and governments,\" Herzog said, apparently ruling out joining forces with Netanyahu as the Labor Party has done before. \"I think what Israel is most in need of is an alternative voice that continues to say the truth. \"And I'm telling everyone, 'Believe, a change will come.' \" Official results will not be released until next week, with the process of building coalitions expected to take much longer. No party has ever won a majority of seats in the Knesset, meaning coalition governments are as old as the modern state of Israel. The victory goes to the party leader most suited to put together a 61-seat majority. Aaron David Miller, an ex-adviser to the U.S. government on Arab-Israeli negotiations now with the Wilson Center, predicts former Israeli Communications Minister Moshe Kahlon will be the \"kingmaker\" in any coalition government deal based on the support his Kulanu party got Tuesday. How does Israel's parliament work? There's no guarantee Netanyahu will form such a coalition and stay as prime minister. But he's got a better chance than anyone, and overnight he vowed to work \"quickly and responsibly to form a new government.\" \"Our country's everyday reality doesn't give us the luxury for delay,\" Netanyahu said. If he does lead the next government, he will soon go down in history as the prime minister with the longest continuous tenure in Israel -- thanks to his back-to-back-to-back election wins. Many woke up Wednesday questioning all those polls suggesting that Netanyahu's latest six-year term could be coming to an end. Israeli media outlets released surveys suggesting that either the Zionist Union would win the vote or, at least, finish in a dead heat with Likud. Exit polls from Israel's three major broadcasters showed the two parties neck and neck, not the apparent five-seat advantage that Likud appears to have secured. So what happened? Pollster Avi Degani, who predicted a Likud win all along, said other pollsters relied too heavily on Internet technology and should have done more surveying by phone. \"The Internet does not represent the state of Israel and the people of Israel,\" Degani said, referring to modern statistical methods. \"It represents panels, and the panels are biased strongly to the center.\" As Netanyahu's win reverberates, one question remains: Did he gain extra seats because of an 11th-hour surge, or were the major polls skewed from the beginning? Why were the election polls so wrong? Netanyahu maintained hard-line positions on settlements and negotiations with Palestinians, but his opposition appeared more open to talks and more focused on economic, social and other issues within Israel. Saeb Erakat, the Palestinian chief negotiator with Israel, said, \"The results of the Israeli elections show the success of a campaign platform based on settlements, racism, apartheid and the denial of fundamental human rights of the Palestinian people. \"Such a result would not have been possible had the international community held Israel to account for its systematic violations of international law,\" said Erakat, who works under Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Opinion: Will Netanyahu win seal Iran deal? The post-election view from Hamas, the Islamist political and militant movement that controls Gaza and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and European Union, appeared more resigned. \"Hamas doesn't see any difference between the Israeli parties because they all share the denial of our people's rights and keeps assaulting them (people),\" said Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas spokesman, suggesting that it didn't matter much who prevailed Tuesday. \"We assure that the Palestinian resistance is strong and can impose the facts.\" Miller, the Wilson Center scholar, says he doesn't think that Netanyahu will necessarily hold his hard campaign line on the Palestinians forming their own state if and when he starts his next term. But that doesn't mean an elusive peace deal is coming anytime soon. \"I think the two-state solution, sadly, is in a Bermuda Triangle, sandwiched between a situation that's too hard for it to be implemented and too important for all of the parties -- including the Prime Minister, despite what he said,\" Miller said.

{"article":"England international Zak Hardaker was released by police after admitting assaulting a student, it has emerged. Leeds announced on Tuesday that their full-back was free to resume playing after West Yorkshire police concluded their investigation into an incident in the city last month. The 23-year-old Hardaker and his 19-year-old club-mate Elliot Minchella were both questioned by police and have since been released without charge. England international Zak Hardaker has been released by police after admitting assaulting a student . However, it has been revealed that both men admitted the assault and agreed to pay \u00a3200 in compensation and write a letter of apology to their 22-year-old victim under a 'community resolution'. In a statement, the Super League club said: 'Leeds Rhinos can confirm that Zak Hardaker and Elliot Minchella have both fully co-operated with the police investigation into an incident in Leeds in February this year. 'Both players have been released without charge and the investigation is now concluded. The Rhinos will continue their internal investigation surrounding the incident however both players will be available for selection this week.' The club made no reference to the fact that the pair had admitted or been punished for the offence but West Yorkshire Police confirmed action had been taken. Det Insp David Roberts, from Leeds CID, told the Yorkshire Evening Post: 'A 19-year-old man from Bradford and a 23-year-old man from Knottingley voluntarily attended a police station in Leeds on Monday. 'Both men admitted the offence of assault on a 22-year-old man at a student halls of residence on 3 February on Burley Road, Leeds. Leeds\u00a0Rhinos full back Hardaker is taken on by Hull FC ace Steve Michaels who tries to bring him down . 'As part of a community resolution, which was an agreed course of action with the victim, each man will pay \u00a3200 in compensation to the victim as well as writing a letter of apology.' The victim suffered black eyes and bruising to his ears and neck in what police described as a 'nasty assault' at the Opal One building on Burley Road last month. Hardaker played in the Rhinos' opening four matches of the season but made way for teenager Ashton Golding in the 18-6 defeat by Warrington last Friday. Now he could be set for a recall when Wigan visit Headingley on Friday, although he could still face punishment from his club. Hardaker was fined \u00a32,500 and given a warning by Leeds for breaching their code of conduct after being thrown out of England's World Cup squad in 2013 for misconduct. He also served a five-match ban last June after being found guilty of making homophobic comments to referee James Child during a game at Warrington.","highlights":"England full-back Zak Hardaker has been dropped by Leeds Rhinos .\nThe 23-year-old was released by police after admitting assaulting student .\nPolice say victim suffered two black eyes and bruising to his ears and neck ."}
{"article":"(Travel + Leisure)Quick, imagine a castle: it probably looks a lot like Germany's Neuschwanstein Castle, the turreted inspiration for Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty Castle. Each year, more than 1.5 million travelers are inspired to make the steep walk or catch a horse-drawn carriage to reach this castle perched on a rocky outcropping in the Bavarian countryside. \"People have always been interested in celebrities and powerful people and their homes,\" says Cordula Mauss, PR officer for the Bavarian Administration of State-Owned Palaces. \"Immediately after the death of Ludwig II in 1886, the first tourists came and wanted to see what their king had built as his private residence.\" While castles, palaces and ch\u00e2teaux naturally pique such curiosity, not all have Neuschwanstein's European fairy-tale looks. Some of the world's most-visited palaces, found across Asia, feature red exteriors, pagodas, gates and carvings. Consider Bangkok's gold-spired Grand Palace, where Thai kings lived for 150 years, and where 8 million annual visitors now traipse through ornate rooms, manicured gardens and temples, including one that houses a revered Buddha carved from a single block of jade. Travel + Leisure: See more of the world's most visited castles . Some longtime royal residences have been repurposed as museums. St. Petersburg's riverfront Winter Palace, for instance, is the sixth-most-visited castle, thanks to the appeal of masterworks by Titian and da Vinci along with lavish restored interiors, where Catherine the Great once held court. America's closest approximation is California's Hearst Castle, though it fell short of Travel + Leisure's top 20 list with only 750,000 annual visitors. And while Windsor Castle squeaked in at No. 19, Buckingham Palace didn't make the grade (567,613 annual visitors), nor did Romania's Bran Castle (542,000) or a single Irish castle. Ireland's most visited, Blarney Castle, received 365,000 in 2013. That said, there can be a downside to having too many visitors -- these are delicate, historic structures that have existed for hundreds of years, and some, like Neuschwanstein, limit daily entries. But it's hard to stem curiosity when it comes to the lives of the blue-blooded. As Mauss puts it: \"Who didn't want to be a prince or a princess or at least a knight when he or she was a child?\" The Methodology: To tally up the world's most-visited castles, T+L gathered the most recent data supplied by the attractions themselves or from government agencies, industry reports and reputable media outlets. In most cases, it was 2013 data. Here are the top 10: . No. 1 The Forbidden City (Palace Museum), BeijingAnnual Visitors: 15,340,000 . Each day, tens of thousands of visitors pour through the Forbidden City to see the 178-acre walled compound that once shielded the Imperial Palace from public view -- while housing Chinese emperors and their extensive entourages. (To handle the volume, the government has started requiring advance ticket sales during festivals and holidays and prohibiting annual ticket holders from visiting during peak seasons). Bright red buildings topped with golden pagodas exemplify traditional Chinese architecture, while the Palace Museum showcases art, furniture and calligraphy. Source: China National Tourist Office . No. 2 The Louvre, Paris Annual Visitors: 9,334,0000 . The largest and most famous museum in the world -- displaying masterpieces like La Gioconda (the Mona Lisa) and the Winged Victory of Samothrace -- got its start as a palace. The U-shaped Louvre housed generations of French kings and emperors beginning in the 12th century, and the remnants of the original fortress that occupied the site (built for King Philippe II in 1190) can be seen in the basement of the museum. The building was extended and renovated many times. Head to the decorative arts wing for a glimpse of Napoleon III and Empress Eug\u00e9nie's opulent state apartments, built between 1854 and 1861. Source: Atout France, the France Tourism Development Agency . No. 3 Grand Palace, BangkokAnnual Visitors: 8,000,000 . Royal offices are still used within the Grand Palace, and state visits and royal ceremonies like the Royal Birthday Anniversary of the current King Bhumibol Adulyadej are held there each year. This was also the official residence of Thai kings from 1782 to 1925 and counts numerous buildings, halls and pavilions set around open lawns and manicured gardens. The palace's Temple of the Emerald Buddha is considered one of the most sacred sites in Thailand. Its Buddha was carved from a single block of jade, and his garments, made of pure gold, are changed in a royal ceremony three times a year to reflect the Thai seasons. Source: Thailand Tourist Services . No. 4 Palace of Versailles, FranceAnnual Visitors: 7,527,122 . When Louis XIV built Versailles in the late 1600s, it became the envy of other European monarchs in Europe, and the opulent estate retains an unmistakable allure. Versailles gets seven times the visitors of any other ch\u00e2teau in France (apart from the Louvre); it helps that it's easily accessible from Paris. No other palace in the world can match the grandeur of Versailles's Hall of Mirrors, dripping with chandeliers, and Marie Antoinette's bedroom, decorated with hand-stitched flowers. The vast grounds are free most days and an attraction in themselves, with 50 water fountains, a parterre (formal garden), a grand canal and other sites like the Grand Trianon, built for Louis XIV as a refuge from court life, and Marie Antoinette's Petit Trianon. Source: Versailles Press Office . No. 5 Topkapi Palace, IstanbulAnnual Visitors: 3,335,000 . With a lovely setting overlooking the Bosporus and Sea of Marmara, Topkapi Palace was the royal residence for about 400 years until the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the 1920s. The sultan lived with his wives, concubines, mother and children in the harem, under the fierce protection of eunuchs. Look for the Privy Chamber of Murat III, with its indoor pool, gilded fireplace and walls decorated with blue, white and coral Iznik tiles from the 16th century. The Palace Kitchens reopened in September 2014, displaying fine china and large cookware. And the complex also includes courtyards, gazebos, gardens and the Imperial Treasury. An emerald-and diamond-studded bow and quivers sent by Sultan Mahmud I to the ruler of Persia is just one example of the lavish gifts on view. Source: Go Turkey, Official Tourism Portal of Turkey . No. 6 The Winter Palace (State Hermitage Museum), St. Petersburg, Russia Annual Visitors: 3,120,170 . Catherine the Great and Nicholas I are among the Russian royals who occupied this green-and-white baroque palace along the Neva River from 1762 to 1917. Today, the palace is a museum with one of the finest collections in Europe, including works by Titian, Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci (Benois Madonna). Much of the palace was destroyed by fire in 1837, but the beautifully restored interiors speak to the opulent tastes of the Russian elite. St. George Hall (a large throne room) features two tiers of windows, double Corinthian pink marble columns, patterned parquet floors and gilt bronze details. Source: State Hermitage Museum Press Office . Travel + Leisure: World's coolest bookstores . No. 7 Tower of LondonAnnual Visitors: 2,894,698 . This medieval fortress on the north bank of the River Thames was built to intimidate Londoners and keep out foreign invaders. The oldest part of the structure, the White Tower, dates back to the 12th century. While it originally served as a royal residence, the tower has become notorious for its use as a prison and the site of executions that included Henry VI and Lady Jane Grey. Millions flock to the tower today to see historical reenactments as well as the British Crown Jewels, among them, the Sovereign's Sceptre containing the Great Star of Africa, the largest colorless cut diamond in the world. In 2014, the tower's moat was filled with 888,246 ceramic red poppies in remembrance of British soldiers who died in World War II -- an example of art installations and events held regularly.

Austria's most-visited site is this Rococo palace, a summer retreat for Hapsburg emperors from the 1700s until 1918. Of the 1,441 rooms, the most famous is the Mirror Room, with white and gold Rococo decoration and crystal mirrors, where Mozart is said to have performed his first concert at age six. The palace's elaborate gardens can claim the world's longest orangerie and the site of the first zoo (est. 1752). The guided Grand Tour provides access to all 40 rooms open to the public, including the Gobelin Salon with tapestries from Brussels and the Millions Room, an office paneled in rare rosewood. Source: Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace . No. 9 Alhambra y Generalife, Granada, SpainAnnual Visitors: 2,315,017 . Refined and expanded over centuries, this hilltop palace and fortress complex combines fortifications, gardens, churches and several palaces, notably the Alhambra, and the Generalife, the country estate of the kings of Granada and Andalusia. Both are remarkable examples of Islamic architecture from Spain's medieval period. Expect intricate arabesques, honeycomb vaunted ceilings (muqarnas) and courtyards with pools and fountains. Generalife's Moorish gardens feature large boxwood trees, rosebushes and willows and cypresses. Numbers swell in the spring and summer; to beat the crowds, consider a January visit. Source: Communications Office of the Alhambra and Generalife . No. 10 Shuri Castle, Okinawa, JapanAnnual Visitors: 1,753,000 . Shuri Castle was the seat of the kings of Ryukyu for more than 400 years. The castle was completely destroyed during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945, and reconstruction work was only completed in the early 1990s. The results include eight Chinese-style gates or entrances, plus gardens, a study and a main hall with red-colored tiles on two layered roofs. The three-story red building houses two throne rooms and the royal family's private apartments. Ponds, bridges and miniature islands make up the royal gardens, added in 1799.

{"article":"When Steven Davis arrives back at Hampden for the first time in four years it is sure to be a bittersweet occasion for the former Rangers captain. The memories will come flooding back of his five cup finals as an Ibrox midfielder that ended with the Ibrox players being showered in champagne and drenched in adulation. There was a time when Davis dreamed life would always be like this; that his next trip to Mount Florida would be to add to those two Scottish Cups and three League Cup wins secured under Walter Smith. Southampton midfielder Steven Davis shoots at goal during a  match against West Ham last month . Yet those aspirations ended abruptly when the economics of the madhouse behind the scenes at Ibrox intersected with cold hard reality and Rangers plunged into the financial abyss in 2012. When Davis returns to the city to skipper Northern Ireland in a friendly with Scotland next Wednesday night, he knows he could face a hostile reception from the Rangers fans in the crowd who remain raw about the way their on-field leader walked out when the going got tough. Yet with no clarity on what the future held for the club under Charles Green, Davis was one of several leading players who opted to move on rather than remain to usher in the new era under Charles Green. While Davis takes no personal pleasure from vindication, time has shown his switch to high-flying Southampton to be a shrewd move, as Rangers have, by contrast, stumbled between alternating humiliations and crises over the last three years. And while the 30-year-old would understands any animosity, he hopes the fans realise he was left with no other realistic choice. Davis (centre) lifts the Scottish Cup trophy after Rangers beat Falkirk 1-0 in the 2009 final at Hampden . \u2018I\u2019m really looking forward to the match against Scotland,\u2019 said Davis, who won three SPL titles and was a UEFA Cup Finalist between 2008 and 2012. \u2018I\u2019ve always wanted to get back up the road to catch a game but with the number of fixtures we have nowadays I haven\u2019t managed. \u2018I\u2019ve fond memories from the majority of my appearances at Hampden and without doubt, I always hoped I\u2019d play there a few more times with Rangers. When you enjoy as much success as we did in finals, you clearly want to continue in the same vein. \u2018We always seemed to do well in the cup competitions but none of us \u2013 whether you were a fan or a player \u2013 could have foreseen what would happen at the club. \u2018When you play football, you don\u2019t really have your mind on anything else but with the publicity Rangers get, we started to get away from that. \u2018When the new people came in, we didn\u2019t know who we were dealing with and there was no dialogue in terms of telling us which direction the club was going in. \u2018We never heard from the new owners about how they wanted to take the club forward or what their ambitions were for the next four or five years. Davis (centre) goes flying after being fouled during Northern Ireland's match against the Faroes last year . \u2018We didn\u2019t even hear how the next six months might pan out. There were no conversations had with us at all and it was an impossible situation for everybody. I didn\u2019t ever get a phone call to say what the plans were or what the aims of the club were to try to progress. \u2018I was the captain at the time so if I wasn\u2019t getting a call, it\u2019s fair to say I don\u2019t think anyone else would have been either. \u2018It was difficult because nobody really knew what sanctions were going to be applied and if we were going to be relegated or not. We were put in a position where we had to make a decision on our futures without knowing what the future might hold in store. \u2018We had to make choices without knowing anything and the biggest thing from the club was there was a lack of communication so we didn\u2019t know which way it was going. \u2018I\u2019m sure there will still be a few people who are unhappy with the way players left but we\u2019ve seen a lot of things unravel in the last couple of years. Hindsight is a wonderful thing and everybody can now see the effect the new people had after they came in. \u2018Maybe the fans can start to see where we were coming from and how we looked at it a bit better because of that.\u2019 Davis (right) celebrates with his Rangers team-mates after the Ibrox club won the 2011 League Cup final . As Rangers struggle, Davis has been a key player in Southampton\u2019s challenge for a European place this season. He has tended to keep his own counsel on the thorny issue of Rangers but when he joined Southampton, technically as a free agent, he pushed succeeded for the St Mary\u2019s club to pay Rangers a fee. These days he just hopes the damage of three years of mismanagement at Ibrox can by repaired. \u2018It is difficult to say anything in the media about it because you\u2019re never going to come across the right way in everybody\u2019s eyes,\u2019 the 71-capped Ulsterman said. \u2018It was obviously a difficult situation at the time but whenever I played, I always gave 100 per cent and I loved my time at Rangers. \u2018I\u2019ve got nothing but good memories of the fans, who were excellent with me and any supporters I\u2019ve met since have only been positive. \u2018At the time, a lot of things were said in the heat of the moment but over time, I think people have been able to see we had to make the best decisions for ourselves and our families. Davis (right) poses with Rangers manager Ally McCoist after winning the Scottish Premier League Player of the Month award for September 2011 . \u2018For me, as an international player at 27 as I was then, I wanted to play at the highest level and I had to take everything into consideration. \u2018As we didn\u2019t have any real direction at Rangers we were being made aware of, we wanted to know what was happening but got nothing. \u2018When I joined the club at first, there was no need to have that conversation because we simply went into every competition looking to win it. \u2018That was clear. The fans demanded that, as did the players, but things changed and I hope Rangers can get back to that soon. \u2018I\u2019ve always wanted to get back to Ibrox to see a game and if it wasn\u2019t for what happened, we could potentially all still be there just now. \u2018It\u2019s not like we were all angling for moves. At the time, we had a great dressing room and had had a lot of success over a number of years. There was no real need for any of us to look elsewhere and it was really unfortunate things went the way they did.\u2019","highlights":"Steven Davis returns to Hampden next week for the first time in four years .\nThe Southampton midfielder was once captain of Rangers .\nDavis will skipper Northern Ireland in Wednesday's friendly with Scotland ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Wrapped up in a long brightly-colored scarf, which does little to contain her free-flowing curly hair, Nneka sits back quietly as she tries to bring to mind her very first memory of music. \"I was a kid,\" the Nigerian singer finally says, her thoughts traveling back to Warri, the Niger Delta city where she grew up. \"While I was doing my domestic work in the house, sweeping, waking up at 5am in the morning, there was this bird [singing] -- and I never forgot the melody,\" she continues, breaking a warm smile. \"Funny wise, like 25 years later I was in Lagos and I heard the same melody -- it was amazing!\" Nneka's first musical recollection might be firmly rooted in her birthplace, but the award-winning singer's career was destined to begin thousands of miles away from home -- the daughter of a Nigerian father and a German mother, Nneka moved to Hamburg at the age of 19 to study anthropology. Whilst attending university, she also started exploring her musical talents, and soon found herself performing in various clubs opening up for top reggae and hip-hop names. In 2005, she released \"Victim of Truth,\" a much-lauded debut that fused soulful beats, tasty hip-hop-and reflective ballads with politically-charged lyrics and black consciousness. Since then, she went on to enjoy further chart success, tour extensively and collaborate with global stars like Lenny Kravitz and Damian Marley. And now, the soulful singer is back with a brand new, self-released album -- \"My Fairy Tales\" is a formidable collection of rich afrobeat grooves, reggae-tinged beats and uplifting rhythms that reaffirm her place as one of the continent's most exciting -- and relevant --  artists. CNN's African Voices caught up with Nneka in London to talk about music, memories and the current situation in Nigeria -- as well as present her with the questions you sent via the #AskNneka and #CNNAfrica hashtags. CNN: In the past, you've dealt with issues ranging from the environment and politics, to religion and love -- what are the themes that you're emphasizing at this moment? Nneka: What is happening in Africa at present concerns me a lot. Boko Haram has always been an issue obviously for the past five, six years -- funny wise, there's a track in the album called \"Pray For You\" which I recorded when not too many people knew what was going with Boko Haram in the West. I'm talking about the problems and possible solutions, and what are the reasons for the problems that we have. We as Nigerians, we're not united, that has always been the issue... that's our problem, tribalism, and what belongs to whom. I also talk about children and the future, bringing children into this world... Everyone's living in a cage and then you bring your child into that kind of society, where your child is forced to live in fear. People are afraid to express themselves politically, and even in their home -- I remember the way we grew up, I didn't look my father in the eye until I was 22; you call your father \"Sir, Sir, Sir\" -- apparently it's a form of respect, OK, but respect should not be mistaken with fear. I was afraid and that's the thing, that's the colonial mentality: we mistake fear for respect. He [Goodluck Jonathan] says he wants to tackle Boko Haram, obviously every Nigerian is asking why now, he could had done it a long time ago...but I'm not good at the whole blaming game, I don't want to blame anybody but I pray that he comes up with a good idea for us if he is an honest and genuine guy. But I know that Fela [Kuti] would definitely not be cool with him, Seun [Kuti] is not cool with him, and many other musicians who are very outspoken are not cool with him. CNN: What is the power of music and how can it influence things to bring positive change? Nneka: Music is very powerful, music is big; music is even more powerful than politics at present. Beyonce would definitely draw more crowd than [Nigerian president] Goodluck Jonathan if she was going to hold a speech -- if Beyonce is going to talk about Boko Haram, many people are going to listen, and if she had something to tell Nigerians about love or whatever, many people are going to listen. CNN: How do you see the political and security situation now in Nigeria? Nneka: All I can say is that we do need proper leadership. Yes, that's just easier said than done, but we also need ourselves to take more things into our own hands -- so if we want change, we have to show that we want change, peacefully -- I love Malcolm X but I'd rather go for Martin Luther [King] -- peacefully. And be part of it, not just blame our leaders and making sure that you, yourself, contribute to the change that you want to see. YOUR QUESTIONS . Nneka: My personal life always inspires me, in the first place, and then I try to expand it to the world. I try not to go too personal so that people can have their own interpretation of the song and also relate to it in their own special way. Nneka: I like The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran, I like Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe, I like the Bible. Right now I'm reading The Humans by Matt Haig. Read! Just read, educate yourself! Nneka: The way forward is going to be easier said than done, but tribalism is not they key. What we need is unity and to appreciate each other as Nigerians, as Africans, regardless of tribe and regardless of religion -- imposing your religion on other people is only going to create war and turmoil, there has to be another way. Nneka: Being on tour for like five months; I mean you get used to the life, but [it's hard] when you're coming back home and then realizing that people move on when you're not around. Nneka: It is successfully already, that's why everybody is in it. That's all I can say to that, it's flourishing and they know it's flourishing and that's why they're all there -- the Chinese, the Americans, the Europeans and the rest of them.","highlights":"Nigerian singer Nneka releases latest album, \"My Fairy Tales\"\nShe combines reggae and afrobeat with powerful lyrics tackling politics, love and forgiveness ."}
{"article":"(CNN)As an offensive guard for the Baltimore Ravens, John Urschel already has a lot on his plate. He regularly goes head to head with the top defensive players in the NFL and does his best to keep quarterback Joe Flacco out of harm's way. But besides his endeavors on the field, Urschel also keeps up another demanding pursuit that is rarely associated with NFL players: mathematical research. Not content with the respect of the locker room, he also seeks the esteem of top mathematicians around the globe. \"I have a Bachelor's and Master's in mathematics, all with a 4.0, and numerous published papers in major mathematical journals,\" Urschel wrote in a recent article for The Players' Tribune. His latest contribution to the mathematical realm was a paper for the Journal of Computational Mathematics with the impressively esoteric title, \"A Cascadic Multigrid Algorithm for Computing the Fiedler Vector of Graph Laplacians.\" Urschel, 23, makes no effort to hide his unusual combination of talents: his official Twitter handle is @MathMeetsFball. As word of his double life spread on social media in recent days, users responded with fascination and admiration. \"You are my goddamn hero (football fan and aspiring complex\/functional analyst here),\" tweeted Roy Cardenas, who describes himself as a math Ph.D. student. But Urschel acknowledges that he has faced questions from NFL officials, journalists, fans and fellow mathematicians about why he runs the risk of potential brain injury from playing football when he has \"a bright career ahead of me in mathematics.\" After every season, he says in the Players' Tribune article, his mother tries to discourage him from continuing to play football. The Penn State graduate says the reason he keeps going isn't for the money (he drives a used Nissan Versa and lives on less than $25,000 a year) or \"for some social status associated with being an elite athlete.\" It's simpler than that. \"I play because I love the game. I love hitting people,\" he writes. \"There's a rush you get when you go out on the field, lay everything on the line and physically dominate the player across from you.\" \"This is a feeling I'm (for lack of a better word) addicted to, and I'm hard-pressed to find anywhere else,\" he explains. He shared his thoughts after San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland announced last week that he was retiring from professional football at age 24 because he was worried about the long-term effects of head trauma. Urschel says he envies Borland but doesn't feel able to quit. \"When I go too long without physical contact I'm not a pleasant person to be around,\" he writes. \"This is why, every offseason, I train in kickboxing and wrestling in addition to my lifting, running and position-specific drill work.\" And as if two areas of overachievement weren't enough, there is one other thing at which Urschel excels. \"I'm also an avid chess player,\" he says. \"And I have aspirations of eventually being a titled player one day.\"","highlights":"The NFL player has published numerous papers in major math journals .\nHe keeps playing football despite the risk of potential brain injury .\n\"I play because I love the game.

{"article":"(CNN)Look to the skies above London and you'll see the usual suspects -- rainclouds, planes and pigeons. But by the end of the year, you might just see something else. Longer than a soccer pitch and filled to the brim with helium, at 302 feet long, the Airlander 10 will be the world's biggest aircraft. Part blimp, part plane, part helicopter, it was originally created by British design company Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV) for military surveillance by the U.S. Army. But budget cuts doomed the project and HAV bought the airship back across the pond, where it seemed set to remain on solid ground until the company received a \u00a33.4 million ($5.1 million) grant from the UK government. Thanks to this recent injection of financing, designers and engineers are now readying the craft for first flight tests scheduled for later this year. While the concept has been around for nearly a century, airships fell out of fashion following the Hindenburg disaster in 1937, when the German passenger craft erupted into flames while trying to dock, killing 36. While an airship might seem like a craft from a time long passed, it has been given a 21st century design overhaul and HAV hopes to have airships back in the skies over the UK by 2016. Chris Daniels, HAV head of partnerships and communications, said: \"The sole problems existing old-style airships had (were) having lots of ground crew, limited ability to carry payloads and to be susceptible to weather conditions. We solved all those problems with a new concept -- a hybrid aircraft. So a mix between a wing and an airship.\" The Airlander 10 -- named because it can carry 10 tons -- is made of a bespoke fabric of carbon fiber, kevlar and mylar, while the pressure of the helium inside maintains the aircraft's shape. Diesel fuel helps the Airlander take off and land and powers the propellers. The spacious cockpit is currently configured to accommodate a pilot and one observer but Daniels says this can easily be reconfigured to end-user specifications. The airship also has green credentials -- its creators say the current version uses 20% fuel burn of existing aircraft, can be fitted with solar panels, uses near-silent 325 hp V8 engines and can stay airborne for five days while carrying its maximum payload. The vehicle can also operate in extreme weather conditions (+54 to -56 degrees Celsius). While the previous U.S. Army project had military applications in mind, this time HAV plans to split end use 60:40 between civlian and military applications. Daniels says that they've had incredible interest from at home and abroad. The U.S. Coastguard has expressed interest in using the hybrid airships to monitor the nation's coastline. Meanwhile Swedish firm OceanSky, in conjunction with the government, wants to use the Airlander as an air transport system for wind turbines. Daniels explained: \"At the moment, the only way of  doing (transporting the equipment) is basically plowing a 50m-wide highway through pristine Nordic forest, which is not a good thing to do and they don't want to destroy ecological environment.\" Showing the versatility in air transport operations the airship could have, Daniels said the charity Oxfam is keen to task the aircraft on aid relief missions following natural disasters, while HAV is in talks with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, to help conduct scientific research. Using airships for military purposes such as reconnaissance and surveillance is not a new idea and today faces stiff competition from drones. Tim Robinson, editor-in-chief of AEROSPACE Magazine, said: \"The Airlander does have one big benefit over UAVs. It can lift a heavier payload than most drones so allows for radars, better cameras, multiple sensors, etc. Payload weight is one of biggest limiters of UAVs -- so that would be extremely attractive to militaries looking to put larger or heavier sensors on board. It is also manned (piloted) which gives it more flexibility in being able to deploy to where it is needed.\" Robinson also highlighted commercial possibilities for the Airlander, such as long-range cargo airships and humanitarian missions. \"The ability of the airship not to need runways or airports would be very attractive for disaster relief. While helicopters can also land anywhere, they are limited in payload and range -- plus the Airlander is much more efficient thanks to its hybrid 'lifting body' design.\" He added: \"Imagine a large airship being able to land with a medical emergency department on board, right at the scene of the disaster.\" But the aviation expert is also cautiously optimistic about the future of the Airlander. He said there had been several \"false dawns\" in bringing about the return of the airship in previous years, including two military surveillance airship projects from the U.S. Pentagon which were ultimately sidelined \"because they weren't confident in the technology.\" While Robinson calls it \"the most promising lighter-than-air vehicle project we have seen in a long time,\" only successful first flight tests at the end of the year and further demos and trials will show off the Airlander 10's true capabilities. Until then, keep your eyes fixed to the horizon, where you might just see the future of aviation re-emerge through the clouds.

{"article":"Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn was able to leave Melbourne with a smile, happy to see the end of what she described as one of the worst weeks of her career. The first five and a half days from last Monday were overshadowed by a legal battle in the Supreme Court of Victoria with former reserve driver Giedo van der Garde and his claim on a full-time race-seat for this season. That was eventually resolved on Saturday morning ahead of qualifying for the Australian Grand Prix, although further talks are planned this week - in a private arena away from the courtroom - between both sides in a bid to finally close the matter. Monisha Kaltenborn was happy to end a tough week with a smile on her face at the Australian Grand Prix . Sauber have been embroiled in a legal battle with their former reserve driver Giedo van der Garde (centre) Once Sauber and Kaltenborn were again able to concentrate on the racing, drivers Marcus Ericsson and rookie Felipe Nasr acquitted themselves well. Nasr was a superb fifth - the highest position by a Brazilian driver on debut - while Ericsson's eighth-place finish was the best result by a Swede since Stefan Johansson in the 1989 Portuguese Grand Prix. When you consider Sauber endured the worst season in their history last year when they failed to score a point , their feats around Melbourne's Albert Park were all the more remarkable. 'It was a very nice ending to the weekend,' Kaltenborn said. 'The events of last week were not easy for the entire team. You can try to keep things away from them, but they are exposed to it. You just don't know how to shield it from them. On the track, Felipe Nasr finished fifth - the highest a Brazilian driver has ever finished on his debut . Kaltenborn (left) looks dejected as she attends a press conference of team principals in Melbourne last week . 'But it was impressive how the team continued to do their work, to remain focused and to bring home the kind of result we saw. 'For me personally, last week was probably one of my toughest in my time at Sauber, and I don't want to experience it again. 'I'm very glad it's over - all the more glad with the outcome (of the race) - and we focus now on the future.' Kaltenborn conceded on Friday the events of last week had resulted in 'a negative impact' on the team, but she felt confident that, given the tremendous result, it had now been restored. 'With what happened, the morale was affected, but you could feel they got themselves together,' Kaltenborn added. 'With these kind of results, you can have an extra push of motivation and you can feel good about it. 'This result tells people we're back, to forget about what happened last year, that it was a one-off and won't happen again.'","highlights":"Sauber's opening week to the Formula One season was overshadowed by a legal battle with former reserve driver Giedo van der Garde .\nThe case was over his claim on a full-time race seat for this season .\nThat was resolved on Saturday morning and Sauber impressed at the Australian Grand Prix, their drivers finishing fifth and eighth .\nLast season, they didn't earn a point and team principal Monisha Kaltenborn admits she was happy to end a tough week with a smile\u00c2 ."}

A \u00a0bogey on the par-four 12th scuppered Howell's chances of taking a share of first place. Twenty-year-old Matthew Fitzpatrick was in the hunt on three under after picking up three strokes on the front nine before remedying the effect of a bogey on the eighth with a birdie on the 531-yard 15th. Welwyn Garden City's Tom Lewis and Gregory Havret of France also signed for 69 while South African hopeful Doug McGuigan fired four birdies over his first seven holes before slipping away to card 71. Howell, who came second in last week's Joburg Open, is currently tied second on day one with Bland . Among the players making good progress up the leaderboard from the later group was Spaniard Eduardo De La Riva, who opened with an eagle on the par-five first hole before finding birdies on the third and fifth. The title will definitely change hands this year given 2014 champion Thomas Aiken is instead competing at the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral.","highlights":"Kevin Phelan took the early lead in South Africa with a five-under-par 67 .\nRichard Bland and David Howell lead chasing pack after each making 68 .\nHowell trying to go one better from last week's second at Joburg Open ."}

{"article":"(CNN)The fury of Tropical Cyclone Pam, one of the most powerful storms ever to make landfall, has moved on, but the misery it left behind in the islands of Vanuatu is just starting to become apparent. Aid workers described scenes of extensive devastation in the capital, Port Vila, and expressed fears of even more destruction farther afield. Thousands were in need of shelter, food and water, the Red Cross said Sunday. \"Homes have been lost, crops are destroyed. The damage is enormous, and people need our help,\" said Aurelia Balpe, head of the Red Cross in the Pacific. \"Yet it will still take some time before we really understand the full extent of the damage.\" The storm flattened houses, scattered trees across roads and inflicted damage on key buildings meant to serve as safe havens, such as the hospital, schools and churches. \"It's becoming increasingly clear that we are now dealing with worse than the worst-case scenario in Vanuatu,\" said Helen Szoke, executive director in Australia for the aid group Oxfam. \"This is likely to be one of the worst disasters ever seen in the Pacific.\" At least 90% of housing in Port Vila has been badly damaged, parts of the hospital are flooded and the state mortuary took a hit, Oxfam said. Some 60,000 children are in need of assistance, UNICEF reported Sunday. How to help Vanuatu residents . At least six people have been confirmed dead. But communications with many of the 80-plus islands in the archipelago are down, so the fear is that the toll will climb as more information emerges. The confirmed deaths, reported by the National Disaster Management Office, are just from Port Vila. For most of a 24-hour period between Friday and Saturday, the cyclone pummeled Vanuatu, where some 260,000 people live, many in flimsy homes built of thatch. It is unclear how many thousands of people have been displaced by the massive storm, which had the power of a Category 5 hurricane when it made landfall. Aerial assessments are being carried out by military aircraft from New Caledonia, Australia and New Zealand. Relief workers are raising concerns about a lack of clean water and sanitation for the many people left homeless. Aid has started to trickle in. The Australian government said a first contingent of officials and supplies arrived in Port Vila around noon Sunday and more flights were expected to follow. \"In Port Vila, there's a lot of activity now -- people are starting to emerge,\" said Tom Perry of the aid group CARE International. \"You can see trees that are strewn across roads being chopped down. The evacuation centers are beginning to be set up.\" Perry, who arrived on one of the first Australian military flights into Port Vila, told CNN the damage there was \"very significant\" with trees that looked like \"snapped toothpicks.\" \"It's like a bomb has gone through,\" said journalist Michael McLennan, who lives in Port Vila. \"It's really quite apocalyptic.\" Most buildings in the capital were destroyed or damaged, he told CNN on Sunday. Many roads were blocked by fallen trees or power lines. The main objective now is to get disaster response teams into Vanuatu and kick-start the humanitarian operation, Sune Gudnitz, regional head for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told CNN from Fiji, about 600 miles away. His aid agency has had word of much destruction on Efate, the island where Port Vila is located, and from the southern island of Tanna, he said. Only a little information has so far trickled out from beyond the capital, but Gudnitz said he fears the worst. \"Unfortunately, the more that comes out, the worse it looks,\" he said. Vanuatu President Baldwin Lonsdale, who was at a U.N. conference on disaster risk reduction in Japan on Saturday, issued an appeal to the global community to help his shattered nation. Vanuatu has officially declared a state of emergency, opening the door for other countries to help. Vanuatu's remote location adds to the challenges the international response faces. Port Vila is more than 1,770 kilometers (1,100 miles) northeast of Brisbane on Australia's east coast, and some 2,200 kilometers (1,367 miles) north of Auckland, the closest city in New Zealand. Reaching the more isolated communities will also take time. Vanuatu's archipelago -- comprising 83 small islands, about 65 of them inhabited -- is roughly 850 kilometers (528 miles) long. Many of the people are subsistence farmers, said CNN's Bill Weir, who visited Vanuatu recently. He recalled talking to a resident who built the first indoor bathroom on his island and sought advice on where to find a toilet paper dispenser. \"It's setting them back years,\" Weir said of the storm. People away from the capital live much as their ancestors did generations ago. Homes are built of weak materials, including straw and corrugated steel, that stood little chance against Pam's raging winds. \"When you've got a Category 5 cyclone that essentially just sat here for 24 hours -- where do you go when you have a storm that powerful?\" Perry of CARE International said. \"It's very terrifying to think about what people have been through.\" While international teams are finding a way in, it will be up to humanitarian agency staffers on the ground and the local communities themselves to do what they can to get by amid the wreckage. Aid workers said the most immediate challenge is to get clean water to people. Many people will be spending another night in emergency shelters. Track the storm . Pam is the South Pacific's second strongest cyclone since record-keeping began in 1970. And it's the strongest of any type since Super Typhoon Haiyan smashed into the Philippines in 2013, killing more than 6,000 people. CNN's Ralph Ellis, Ben Brumfield and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","highlights":"Situation is \"worse than the worst-case scenario,\" Oxfam says .\nHomes, hospital, schools and churches all damaged, aid group reports .\nAid officials and supplies start to arrive in Vanuatu's capital from Australia ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Could it get any cuter than seal pup kisses? The U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Department of Interior this week shared a photo of a Weddell seal nuzzling up to what looked to be its mom in Erebus Bay, Antarctica. The expression of the mother is priceless. The photo was taken in October by USGS scientist William Link. Link, a statistician, was helping researchers tag newborn seal pups. He confirmed Friday that the adult seal was the baby's mom. It's hard to know what she was thinking when her baby nuzzled up to her in this photo, but Link said the animals flare their noses when disturbed, \"so this Mom was pretty relaxed,\" Link told CNN Friday. \"I have a great shot a few seconds later where Mom yawned hugely. She looked utterly content, to me.\" The agency's public affairs department had asked scientists for interesting images to post on social media. As the Instagram caption notes, the Weddell seals of Erebus Bay have been studied extensively for over 40 years. \"Because of its isolation, this population is undisturbed by human activities. The Weddell seal population is healthy and stable, and thus gives a good example for studies of animal population dynamics.\" Link said it was a privilege to see the animals up close. \"I was awed,\" he said. \"It's incredible that animals can live and thrive in such harsh conditions. It's hard to describe the remoteness and isolation of the spot -- bitter cold, high winds, no life to be seen except for the seals, an occasional skua or an emperor penguin.\" After a seal pup is born, Link said its mom spends all her time close to her baby in a very small area, with hardly any interaction with other seals. \"Mom doesn't even leave for a swim until the baby is nearly ready to be weaned, and even then doesn't get to eat. So while baby puts on a couple of hundred pounds, Mamma loses about twice that much,\" he said.

{"article":"(CNN)When man relies on machine, there is always something that can go wrong. And there is no more unforgiving environment than the high-stakes world of Formula One. \"Racing is one of those... probably a crueler sport in that there's so many other variables,\" says Red Bull's No.1 driver Daniel Ricciardo, ahead of Sunday's season-opening Australian Grand Prix. \"Unfortunately it's not like tennis where all the racquets are pretty much the same and you can't blame anyone but yourself.\" Ricciardo experienced the full extent of F1's cruelty at last year's Melbourne race. The Australian crossed the line in second place -- seemingly becoming the first Aussie to finish on the podium at Albert Park -- but jubilation soon turned to despair. He was disqualified hours after the race when officials ruled his car had exceeded the maximum fuel flow rate, a rule which states each car is limited to 100 kilograms of fuel per race and was introduced to make the sport more fuel efficient. \"It's frustrating, I mean it's a part of the sport which will always be frustrating,\" said the 25-year-old, reflecting on what was his Red Bull debut. \"I'm sure even Lewis (Hamilton) and Nico (Rosberg) last year were frustrated at the times because you never have the perfect car,\" he added, referring to the two Mercedes drivers, who finished first and second last season. \"But it is what it is, I signed up for that a long time ago, and you just learn to accept it.\" It's a sport where even driving ability often fails to overcome mechanical failures -- eventual world champion Hamilton was forced to retire from last year's race at Albert Park. But technical blunders don't always end in disaster -- Hamilton won the Italian Grand Prix after experiencing mechanical faults early in the race, and Finnish driver Valterri Bottas lost a wheel in 2014's opener before roaring to a fifth-place finish. Despite Ricciardo's previous disappointment, he's can't wait to race on his home turf again next Sunday. \"I definitely feel privileged to have a home race... it just increases all the hype and all the excitement\" said Ricciardo, adding that he would use \"all the Australian flags and all the cheers to my advantage.\" After last year's disaster Ricciardo is looking to make things right, \"There's a little bit of redemption, I'm confident we can get it back.\"","highlights":"Red Bull's No.1 driver Daniel Ricciardo says Formula One is a \"crueler sport\"\nLast year Ricciardo was disqualified from the Australian Grand Prix after finishing second .\nThe 25-year-old is looking for redemption in Melbourne on Sunday ."}
{"article":"Washington (CNN)House Speaker John Boehner said Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is \"innocent until proven guilty\" after the U.S. military charged him with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, but emphasized in an exclusive interview with CNN's Dana Bash that he was more concerned about the circumstances of his release. Bergdahl's attorney also released a statement on Wednesday, outlining his defense of the soldier and containing a two-page letter from Bergdahl describing the torture he endured, which included months spent chained to a bed and further years spent chained on all fours or locked in a cage. Shortly after the charges were announced, Bergdahl's attorneys released a lengthy statement that includes a letter sent to Milley earlier this month outlining their defense of the soldier. \"In light of the nearly five years of harsh captivity Sgt. Bergdahl endured, the purpose of his leaving his unit, and his behavior while a prisoner, it would be unduly harsh to impose on him the lifetime stigma of a court-martial conviction or an other than honorable discharge and to deny him veterans benefits,\" attorney Eugene R. Fidell writes in the letter. The statement includes a two-page accounting from Bergdahl of his time in captivity, in which he recounts months spent chained to a bed, then further years spent chained on all fours or locked in a cage. Read the statement and Bergdahl's letter . Bergdahl said for years his body and health declined due to malnourishment, and sores on his wrists and ankles from the shackles grew infected. \"My body started a steady decline in constant internal sickness that would last through the final year,\" he said. Bergdahl was frequently beaten, at times with copper wire or a thick rubber hose, and forced to watch Taliban videos, he said. He had no concept of time, and was repeatedly told he would be killed and would never again see his family. \"I was kept in constant isolation during the entire five years, with little to no understanding of time, through periods of constant darkness, periods of constant light, and periods of completely random flickering of light and absolutely no understanding of anything that was happening beyond the door I was held behind,\" he wrote. Bergdahl tried a dozen times to escape, he wrote. In his interview with Bash, Boehner said \"like any American, you're innocent until proven guilty.\" \"And these charges are coming. There will be a trial,\" Boehner said in an interview taped Wednesday to air Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Boehner said the \"more troubling part\" of Bergdahl saga is the fact that the U.S. government traded five Taliban fighters for Bergdahl's release, and that recent reports indicate one has returned to the battlefield. He expressed concerns about other detainees held at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, which President Barack Obama is working to close, \"ending up back on the battlefield and threatening Americans here and abroad.\" Obama \"violated the law\" in failing to alert Congress before the prisoner swap occurred, Boehner added. \"And I still believe that's the more troubling part of this,\" he said. \"We've made clear in the past that we won't negotiate with terrorists, and but yet here we did.\" Military officials announced Wednesday afternoon they would charge Bergdahl with one count each of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. Bergdahl left his post in Afghanistan before being captured and held captive for five years. For that, he faces charges that carry a maximum penalty of life in a military prison, and he could also have to forfeit pay and be stripped of his rank, Army Col. Daniel King said as he announced the charges. Bergdahl faces a military procedure similar to a grand jury that will whether charges are appropriate, King said. Then, he could face court martial proceedings. The decision comes nearly a year after Bergdahl returned to the United States as part of a prisoner exchange and since the Army began a formal investigation into his disappearance from his unit in eastern Afghanistan in June 2009. The Army concluded its investigation into the circumstances of Bergdahl's capture in December. Until now, it has been in the hands of Gen. Mark Milley, head of U.S. Army Forces Command, who made the decision to charge Bergdahl. Several U.S. military officials CNN has spoken with suggested privately that the process took longer than expected. Ahead of Wednesday's announcement, officials said Milley only had a few choices. Though the sense had been that Bergdahl must be held accountable for his actions, there had been little appetite for a lengthy term in military confinement given the five years Bergdahl was held by the Taliban. Now 28, Bergdahl was taken by the Haqqani terrorist network. But the circumstances of Bergdahl's departure from his base and how willingly he left have not been clear. King said he couldn't offer those details on Wednesday, and that they're being treated as evidence for the upcoming proceedings against Bergdahl. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Arizona, called the charges an \"important step\" on Wednesday. \"This is an important step in the military justice process towards determining the accountability of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl,\" he said in a statement. \"I am confident that the Department of the Army will continue to ensure this process is conducted with the utmost integrity under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, meanwhile, lambasted the \"unevenness\" of Obama's swap of five Taliban prisoners for Bergdahl. \"I wouldn't have done this trade for a Medal of Honor winner,\" he told CNN. \"No military member should expect their country to turn over five Taliban commanders to get their release. Nobody should expect that. It's not the nature of his service that drives my thinking it's just the illogical nature of the swap.\" Some members of Bergdahl's platoon have criticized him, labeling Bergdahl a deserter. \"I was pissed off then, and I am even more so now with everything going on,\" former Sgt. Matt Vierkant, a member of Bergdahl's platoon when he went missing on June 30, 2009, told CNN last year. \"Bowe Bergdahl deserted during a time of war, and his fellow Americans lost their lives searching for him.\" Bergdahl was freed in May when President Barack Obama agreed to swap five Taliban prisoners who had been detained in Guantanamo Bay to secure Bergdahl's freedom, sending those detainees to Qatar. Obama announced Bergdahl's release to fanfare in the White House Rose Garden, flanked by the Army sergeant's parents, Bob and Jani Bergdahl. His hometown of Hailey, Idaho, had planned a parade to celebrate Bergdahl's homecoming but later canceled that celebration amid security concerns stemming from the unanswered questions surrounding his disappearance and the resulting controversy over his release. After returning to the United States, Bergdahl had been on active duty at an administrative job at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. There, the Army assigned Bergdahl a \"sponsor\" to help him adjust to life in his new post. Upon returning, Bergdahl refused to meet with his parents -- and months later, Army officials had said he was communicating with them but still had not met them face to face. The five figures the United States exchanged to secure Bergdahl's release were Khair Ulla Said Wali Khairkhwa, Mullah Mohammad Fazl, Mullah Norullah Nori, Abdul Haq Wasiq and Mohammad Nabi Omari. They were mostly mid- to high-level officials in the Taliban regime and had been detained early in the war in Afghanistan because of their positions within the Taliban, not because of ties to al Qaeda. The detainee swap for Bergdahl has become increasingly controversial in recent weeks after a report published by the office of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said one of the 17 intelligence agencies operating under its umbrella had judged that a prisoner released in the exchange had since contacted the Taliban. CNN's Ted Barrett and Alexandra Jaffe contributed to this report.","highlights":"House Speaker says his problem with Bergdahl case is the way prisoner swap was handled .\nAttorney releases Bergdahl's account of his time as a prisoner ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Airstrikes started Wednesday in Tikrit, where Iraqi and coalition forces are battling to wrest control from ISIS. \"These strikes are intended to destroy ISIL strongholds with precision, thereby saving innocent Iraqi lives while minimizing collateral damage to infrastructure,\" said Lt. Gen. James L. Terry, commanding general of the international coalition, led by the United States. \"This will further enable Iraqi forces under Iraqi command to maneuver and defeat ISIL in the vicinity of Tikrit,\" he said, using an alternative acronym for ISIS. At the request of  Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, the coalition is providing \"airstrikes, airborne intelligence capabilities, and advise and assist support to Iraqi Security Force headquarters elements,\" it said. According to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, the first wave of airstrikes was intended to hit about a dozen preplanned targets. Tikrit, best known to Westerners as the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, fell in June to ISIS, which has captured large areas of Iraq and Syria for what it says is its Islamic caliphate. On March 1, al-Abadi ordered Iraqi forces to retake Tikrit and Salaheddin province. There have been several failed attempts to recapture Tikrit since the second half of 2014. If Iraq regains control of the city, it could mean that retaking Mosul -- a city 10 times bigger -- is possible.

{"article":"The challenges of taking a penalty in football are so well documented - a baying crowd, pressurised responsibility and psychological isolation - it's no wonder that most clubs tend to dedicate time on the training ground to how to deal with them. Austrian third division side FC Pinzgau have decided to try out a rather strange technique to practice their spot-kicks. Players were tasked with scoring from 12 yards after having spun their entire body around 20 times. Players were made to spin around 20 times before taking their shots from 12 yards . The unique penalty practice resulted in several hilarious failed attempts as players fell to the ground . The rationale behind this exercise is unclear, but one could assume that if a player can take a penalty while dizzy, then he can probably manage it in a game. Right? What followed was hilarious. Unsurprisingly, a number of Pinzgau players failed to score with their attempts and some even to make contact with the ball, instead landing bottoms up on the turf. This player doesn't even make contact with the ball before he goes crashing into the turf . After falling over twice more, he eventually manages to get his shot away and scores in the open goal .

Stuart Lancaster\u2019s team are bracing themselves for a fearsome onslaught in the latest instalment of \u2018Le Crunch\u2019 as they aim to clinch the RBS 6 Nations title and there is a significant chance they could turn to hooker Tom Youngs and lock Geoff Parling. Lifted by their win over Italy in Rome on Sunday, Philippe Saint-Andre\u2019s French side will come to London with a monster pack and orders to grind English ambition into the earth. Yet the home forward unit, marshalled by Graham Rowntree, have stood toe-to-toe with all-comers and trumped most rivals in recent years, even if their dominance of the close-quarters combat has not always brought the deserved results. England forward Courtney Lawes described the French pack as 'big dudes' Along with Youngs and Parling, flanker Tom Wood is another established figure pushing hard for a place in the starting XV. One man who will be at the forefront of the home resistance is Northampton lock Courtney Lawes, whose comeback from injury against Scotland was a resounding personal triumph. He was laid back on Monday when considering the magnitude of a title decider. When asked about his French counterparts Yoann Maestri and Alexandre Flanquart, he said: \u2018They\u2019re big dudes. It\u2019ll be an interesting game.\u2019 It will be interesting for those who relish a thunderous encounter and Lawes is certainly in that category. He added: \u2018I\u2019ve played against many French sides. They\u2019re always physical. Obviously we\u2019ve got to stay with them and show them they can\u2019t just roll over us.

{"article":"Playing with Thierry Henry turned Bradley Wright-Phillips into the MLS's top goal scorer last season. The duo had chemistry and the result was one of those seasons that will be hard to beat, with the Englishman scoring 27 goals in 32 games and winning the league's golden boot. Doing it again might be a lot tougher. Henry, the French international who brought immense talent and recognition to the league, has retired and Wright-Phillips is going to have to go through an adjustment period. Bradley Wright-Phillips (left) didn't have a shot in the Red Bulls' season opener against Sporting Kansas City . Thierry Henry retired at the end of the season meaning Wright-Phillips has a new strike partner . The Red Bulls have revamped their roster and Henry isn't the only one gone. Australian international Tim Cahill has departed along with fellow midfielder Eric Alexander. In the season opening tie against Sporting Kansas City, Wright-Phillips didn't have a shot. 'I don't have to readjust my game,' the 30-year-old Englishman said after the Red Bulls practiced for their home opener against D.C. United on Sunday. 'I am always going to play the same way I always have. The players that have come in, I'm trying to learn like I did with Thierry. I learned how he played and I learned to play off him. I'll try to do the same with the new guys.' The additions this season are midfielders Sacha Kljestan and Felipe Martins and striker Mike Grella. But in the 1-1 season-opening draw, the chemistry was lacking up front. 'On the day of the game I put a lot of it down to me,' Wright-Phillips said. 'I was a bit too eager to get behind. I could have done a little bit better with my runs. It's the first game, I don't really lose my mind after a first game of the season.' If there is a difference this season it's the style of the Red Bulls' play under new coach Jesse Marsch. There is an emphasis on moving the ball quickly with everybody contributing. A lot went through Henry in past seasons. The New York Red Bulls drew 1-1 with Sporting Kansas City in their first MLS game of the season . 'For us, it was almost a little unrealistic having a guy like Thierry on the team,' Red Bulls captain and midfielder Dax McCarty said. 'He was a little of a wild card, a joker. If you are losing or in a bad situation, you could just play him the ball and hope that something magical happened, which more often than not did. That's gone. I think this is a team that can hurt you in numerous ways and that's going to be a big shift this season. McCarty said the team could have helped Wright-Phillips more in the opening game. 'We didn't create enough chances for Bradley,' McCarty said. 'I think he will admit he can do a better job making better runs and we have a do a better job of looking for him and finding him when he does make those good runs. That is the thing that is going to make us successful this season. Wright-Phillips isn't heading into the season thinking: how does he top last year? He has set a goal target that he is not disclosing. If he meets it, he'll set another one. Whatever he does, Wright-Phillips isn't interested in heading back to England, where he played for Manchester City, Southampton, Plymouth Argyle, Charlton Athletic and Brentford before coming to the Red Bulls in July 2013. 'I don't want to go back to Europe. I've said that several times,' Wright-Phillips said. 'There were one or two whispers that I heard about but it doesn't interest me. I'm playing for the New York Red Bulls and I love living in New Jersey.' Wright-Phillips says he has no desire of coming back to England and is enjoying life in the USA .","highlights":"Thierry Henry retired from football at the end of the season .\nBradley Wright-Phillips was the MLS's top scorer last year .\nNew York Red Bulls striker says he won't change playing style .\nEnglishman also insists he has no desire of returning to play in Europe ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Gold bars. Each weighed between 25 and 27 pounds, together about 275 pounds. The bars' total weight in gold is worth about $4.8 million. That much adds up. But what about the story of how they got swiped on Sunday from a truck alongside Interstate 95 in North Carolina? Investigators are trying to figure that out, including how two armed security guards could have been so quickly pounced upon, bound and then robbed so soon after pulling over in Wilson County, as they've told authorities. \"There's suspicion about everything going on in this case,\" Wilson County Sheriff Calvin Woodard Jr. said Wednesday in a news conference about the case. He also released composite sketches of two of the three suspects, one of whom he described as a heavyset Hispanic male with a Cuban accent and the other as a dark-skinned Hispanic male with a white mustache and goatee who was dressed in black. He showed reporters a photo of the white van they allegedly got away in, as well as an image of the traffic cones they used -- which came from a Florida company that doesn't do business in North Carolina. What he couldn't say definitively was whether these men had some help. There are a lot of questions, in fact, that can't be answered. Authorities say the initial statements from the two guards who work for TransValue Inc., a Florida-based company that transports valuables, were a bit confusing due to the guards' spotty English, though Woodward said police now have a clearer picture after bringing in Spanish-speakers to translate. These two men, both of whom have worked for TransValue for several years, set off early Sunday morning from Miami with a truck full of gold protected by a padlock and presumably their firearms. They were headed for Bridgewater, Massachusetts, \"to a place ... where they handled such things,\" Woodard explained. They stopped to get gas in Dillon, South Carolina, then hit the interstate once again. The guards later told police they smelled gas, with one of them getting sick. So they pulled over. That leads to the first big question about the men's story: Did something happen to their vehicle to cause the gas smell? Not according to a Wilson County mechanic, who \"did not determine any type of issues\" with the truck, according to Woodard. So the sicker guard gets out of the vehicle. He says he's quickly met by two suspects, who yell out, \"Policia, policia.\" They ask him to go to the ground then tie him up with three zip ties, according to Woodard. After this, the other guard gets out of the vehicle. He encounters the same men -- one of them wearing a red traffic vest -- who repeat that they are police. He says that he, too, eventually gets to the ground and is bound with duck tape. But weren't these armed guards? Yes and no. Neither man had a gun on them when they exited their vehicle, violating their company's protocol, the sheriff said. And did anyone see them get bound and led into the nearby woods? No, at least no one who has contacted police. But people called authorities around 6:49 p.m. Sunday after they spotted the men, still bound, coming out of the woods, according to Woodard. By then, the $4.8 million in gold and the three men suspected of taking it were gone. That's left authorities trying to track those valuables down and piece together exactly what happened. Investigators have already gone to South Carolina, and they're getting help from the FBI. They're all working to get information out of places between Florida and North Carolina, to try to corroborate the guards' stories and uncover any evidence that might identify the suspected thieves. Woodard says TransValue has been \"very cooperative\" in the investigation, as have the company's two guards. Neither was injured beyond some scratches on their legs from going into the woods. \"Right now, (the guards) are still considered victims,\" Woodard said, declining to answer whether or not authorities believe this was an inside job. \"... But we're investigating every avenue.\"","highlights":"A truck filled with gold bars pulled over alongside Interstate 95 in North Carolina .\nTwo guards say they were both bound by men claiming to be police .\nAuthorities are trying to determine if it may have been an inside job ."}
{"article":"(CNN)The health of Singapore's first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, who has been in hospital with pneumonia since February 5, has deteriorated further, the government said Wednesday. The Prime Minister's office had said Tuesday that Lee, 91, who is on a ventilator in the intensive care unit of Singapore General Hospital, had an infection and was being treated with antibiotics. \"Mr Lee Kuan Yew remains critically ill in the ICU and has deteriorated further,\" the office said in its latest update. Later Wednesday, a top government spokesman dismissed as a hoax a report that Singapore's founding father had died. A message about Lee's supposed demise, purporting to be from the current Prime Minister, had circulated online. \"We have reported this to the police and they are investigating this hoax. Our website was not hacked, it was a doctored image,\" Farah Rahim, senior director for the Singapore Ministry of Communications and Information said. Born in 1923, Lee co-founded the city state in 1965 when it declared its independence from Malaysia and was its prime minister for more than three decades. Lee was succeeded as prime minister by Goh Chok Tong in 1990, before Lee Kuan Yew's son Lee Hsien Loong took power in August 2004. The elder Lee has been credited with Singapore's remarkable transformation from a colonial trading post to a prosperous financial center. However, he has also been a divisive figure, attracting criticism for stifling media freedom and for the harsh treatment of political opponents.","highlights":"Health of Singapore's first prime minister deteriorating .\nHe has been treated in ICU for pneumonia since 5 February .\nOn Tuesday, Singapore said he had contracted infection ."}
{"article":"Islamabad (CNN)Pakistan has ordered a stay of execution of a man who was convicted of manslaughter while he was 14 years old. Shafqat Hussain, 24, was scheduled to be hanged on Thursday, but a government official confirmed Wednesday night with a tweet that Hussain will not be hanged and that his case will be reviewed for another 72 hours. \"We are still unclear on what investigation can be done in 72 hours,\" said Shahab Siddiqui, Hussain's lawyer. \"We will be coordinating with the government and are happy to provide any documentation they would need.\" Hussain's case has triggered outrage from human rights campaigners, who complain he did not get a fair trial and had confessed to murder after being severely tortured by the police. His family says Hussain, at the age of 14 was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for kidnapping and killing a child while he was employed as a security guard in 2004. Unable to afford legal counsel the state appointed him a defense lawyer, whom, according to human rights groups, failed to provide any evidence or claim that Hussain was a juvenile. This meant Hussain was tried as an adult in an anti-terrorism court. A social media campaign with the hashtag #SaveShafqat trended in Pakistan and a small protest was held in the capital to raise awareness about his case. Shafqat was calm when he thought he was going to be executed, Manzoor Hussain, his brother told CNN. \"He had said that if I don't get justice in this world, I will get it in my afterlife.\" \"I can't tell you what kind of night my family has had. I close my eyes and I want to forget. I can't express the agony we have gone through, waiting and not knowing.\" Hussain was initially due to be hanged on January 19, but under international pressure, Pakistan's Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar called for a stay order. Addressing parliament, the minister called for an investigation into the young man's age. Two months later, another death warrant was issued for Hussain, with an execution date set for March 19. Since then Hussain's lawyers handed in a plea of clemency to the president's office with documentation that the inmate was a minor at the time of his arrest. Attention to his case comes in the wake of an announcement by Pakistan that it would lift its moratorium on the death penalty for all cases -- not just for those tried in anti-terrorism courts. Pakistan lifted the death penalty moratorium for terrorism cases following the attack on an Army Public School in Peshawar, which left at least 145 teachers and students dead. It was the deadliest act of terror in the country's history. The decision to lift the moratorium on all cases affects more than 8,000 prisoners currently on death row, the largest number in the world. The lifting of the moratorium has caused an uproar of criticism by human rights groups in Pakistan and abroad. \"It's like responding to a blood bath by indulging in blood lust themselves,\" Zohra Yusuf, the chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan told CNN. \"Executions on this scale tend to brutalize society.\" Earlier this week the European Union released a statement on its website calling Pakistan to \"reinstitute the moratorium and to respect fully all its international obligations, in particular the principle of fair trial.\" The statement also said that Pakistan is a party to an international covenant \"that specifically prohibits the use of the death sentence for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age.\"\u200b .","highlights":"Pakistan postpones inmate's execution for the second time .\nShafqat Hussain was convicted at age 14; his family says confession extracted under torture ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Relief workers reported \"unbelievable destruction\" after Tropical Cyclone Pam smashed the capital of Vanuatu, the Australian Red Cross said Saturday. The Australian Red Cross said via Twitter that \"humanitarian needs will be enormous. Many people have lost their homes. Shelter, food and water (are) urgent priorities\" in Port Vila. Meteorologists said the storm has weakened some, but it was still pounding the islands after hours of fierce winds and torrential rain. \"#CyclonePam still tearing through #Vanuatu. 'Much bigger than expected,' says our colleague in Port Vila. Initial reports of devastation,\" the Australian branch of UNICEF said on Twitter earlier. Pam, one of the strongest storms seen in the South Pacific in years, earlier made a direct hit on the capital, raising fears of mass destruction. In its 8 a.m. Saturday update, the Vanuatu Meteorological Services warned of \"very destructive hurricane force winds\" of 155 mph (250 kilometers per hour) in Shefa and Tafea provinces, with several others facing \"very rough to phenomenal seas with heavy swells.\" The Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, said the cyclone had weakened from the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane to a Category 4. It has dumped more than 9 inches of rain on the capital in a 36-hour period and has wind gusts of up to 190 mph (305 kph). Track the storm . Pam is forecast to move southeastward along the western edge of the southern islands of Vanuatu. It isn't expected to make any additional landfalls before dissipating. It will continue to weaken as it crosses cooler waters and encounters higher wind shear. Pam is expected to pass east of New Zealand on Sunday and into Monday. It could bring heavy rainfall to North Island, including Auckland. The capital, the biggest city in the Vanuatu island chain, sits on the coastline, which is vulnerable to storm surges during powerful cyclones. Tropical Cyclone Pam is the strongest storm to make landfall since the devastating Super Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines in 2013. Chloe Morrison, an emergency communications director for the humanitarian organization World Vision, told CNN that she could see some light between her boarded-up windows but it was still hard to see the totality of the destruction outside the house where she and seven others huddled in a back room during the storm. \"Seven hours hunkered down and it's still not safe to go outside,\" she said. \"The winds are still really howling. We're really lucky to be in a concrete house.\" Part of the tin roof twisted off the house and landed by one of the windows, she said. She also noted that two trees outside didn't get uprooted, but they had not one bit of fruit or any leaves remaining. Despite the \"quite terrifying ordeal,\" Morrison said, their house didn't have any damage. Through the night, the wind and torrential rain made it sound like an angry ocean was just outside their doors, she said. World Vision, which says it's been based in Vanuatu for more than 30 years, said its emergency assessment  team would head out to view the damage when it is safe. The staff helped prepare communities on the islands for the cyclone by positioning water, food, blankets, tarpaulins, and shelter, hygiene and kitchen kits in key places, it said, as well as advising on disaster preparedness. Residents have been advised to seek shelter in places such as churches, universities and schools. \"The strongest thing they've got is cement churches,\" said Inga Mepham, program director for CARE International for the Vanuatu program. \"Some of them don't have that. It's hard to find a structure that you'd think would be able to withstand a Category 5 (storm).\" Earlier, photographer Michael McLennan -- who said the storm is being called the \"Vanuatu Monster\" -- told CNN that the \"strength of winds is incredible.\" Video footage he shot earlier Friday showed palm trees being whipped by wind and rain. Evacuation alerts have been issued for several parts of the country. Even before the sun rose Saturday, Vanuatu was already getting hit hard, with most communication and power cut off due to the storm. \"The wind outside is terrifying,\" Michael Wolfe, World Vision's national director in Vanuatu, told that organization. \"I can't imagine what it's like for families out there who weren't able to find safe shelter before the storm.\" The archipelago nation northeast of Australia contains 83 small islands, many of which have little infrastructure and lack the strong housing structures that can endure a walloping storm. Because of the tropical climate in Vanuatu, some of the housing is made of lighter building materials, including straw and corrugated metals. Residents prepared for the storm, boarding up windows and chopping down trees that stand close to buildings in case they could become debris or cause further damage or injury. CNN host Bill Weir, who was recently in Vanuatu on assignment, said that while Port Vila has some modern development in the form of an airport, large hotels and a convention center that's under construction, life on some of the islands has remained almost unchanged for thousands of years. \"For search and rescue, for bringing food and supplies and medicine, it's extremely challenging,\" he said. Pam has triggered watches and warnings in the Solomon Islands and New Zealand. CNN's Greg Botelho and Derek Van Dam contributed to this report.","highlights":"Red Cross says Tropical Cyclone Pam destroyed many homes .\nUNICEF tweets there are reports of devastation in Vanuatu's capital .\nStorm has made a direct hit on the capital of Vanuatu, Port Vila ."}

{"article":"Los Angeles (CNN)Federal agents on Tuesday raided more than three dozen \"maternity hotels\" in Southern California where foreign women give birth, allegedly for the sole purpose of having a U.S.-citizen baby, authorities said. The \"maternity tourism\" sites included apartment complexes in Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties where authorities believe the businesses housed the foreign nationals about to give birth, federal officials said. Those targeted residences are believed to have catered largely to women from China, who paid $15,000 to $50,000 for lodging, transportation and food, according to a statement by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Those fees don't necessarily include medical care, authorities said. Authorities are looking for evidence of bringing in and harboring of undocumented visitors; conspiracy, fraud and misuse of visas and permits; tax evasion and false tax returns; and willful failure to file report of foreign bank and financial accounts, court papers said. \"Based on the results of the investigations to date, it appears the women pay cash for prenatal visits and the actual delivery,\" U.S. authorities said. \"As part of the package, clients were promised they would receive Social Security numbers and U.S. passports for their infants, which the mothers would take with them when they left the U.S.\" Some of the packages included recreational trips to Disneyland, shopping malls and even to a firing range, authorities said. \"Any women encountered at the search locations will be interviewed and those identified as potential material witnesses will be directed when and where to report for further questioning,\" authorities said Tuesday. Investigators weren't expected Tuesday to comment further on the outcome of the raids, said ICE spokeswoman Virginia Kice. In all, authorities obtained warrants for 37 locations and ended up searching more than 50 sites, including consensual searches, Kice said. The purported tourism businesses promoted themselves on the Internet and through social media, authorities said. One firm in Rancho Cucamonga, California, advertised in Chinese and branded itself as \"You Win USA Vacation Resort.\" Operators of that firm couldn't be immediately reached for comment Tuesday. Chinese women have been flocking to the United States to give birth, lured because the country grants American citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil, CNN Money reported last month. That CNN Money account was cited in an affidavit filed Monday in a federal California court by Homeland Security Investigation agent Eric Blair, who asked a judge for a warrant to search Rancho Cucamonga apartment buildings for large sums of cash and evidence of contraband and a crime. The judge granted the warrant. Read one affidavit . \"Perpetrators of visa fraud schemes typically charge $40,000 to $60,000, which is a fee able to be paid by the wealthy in China,\" Blair stated in court papers. In 2012, about 10,000 Chinese women gave birth in the United States, more than double the 4,200 in 2008, according to Chinese state media. Blair alleged that the birthing houses \"will generally advise foreign national clients to fly to tourism points of entry such as Hawaii or Las Vegas and to avoid traveling directly to Los Angeles International Airport. This advice is due to heightened security by (U.S. Customs and Border Protection) officials at LAX based on the volume of fraudulent visas and false statements and entry documents that CPB officials have experienced over the last decade related to birth tourism.\" One operator of the alleged maternity tourism schemes in California was providing bank statements claiming he had monthly gross receipts of $213,968.79 and an annual income of $1,283,812.74, Blair said in court papers. Those bank statements were provided by an Internal Revenue Service special agent, Blair said. Many of the families want an American child because a foreign passport could be the family's ticket out of China if they grow weary of pollution or food safety scares. President Xi Jinping's widespread anti-corruption campaign has given rich Chinese yet another reason to be on edge. \"If things become economically or politically uncertain in one's country of origin, the children have a place to come to,\" Leti Volpp, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told CNN Money last month. The children can \"then sponsor their parents when they turn 21,\" Volpp said. The desire to leave China is especially pronounced among the wealthy. Almost two-thirds of Chinese with more than 10 million yuan ($1.6 million) in the bank have emigrated, or are planning to, according to a Hurun report released last year. One advertisement for a Hacienda Heights location \"claims that the apartments are extremely suitable for expectant mothers and their accompanying families,\" Blair said in court documents. \"The apartment will allow expectant mothers to experience the American lifestyle during their stay.\" In an interview with CNN Money in February, Felicia He, 27, said she paid tens of thousands of dollars to give birth in California. That interview occurred well before Tuesday's federal announcement of raids. \"I started getting ready for the trip around the end of my first trimester,\" He said. \"I asked my friends who have given birth before in the U.S. for a doctor recommendation; then I found a place to stay in the area for a few months, and purchased my plane ticket.\" He, who gave birth last year, said a U.S. passport for her baby means access to better education opportunities. Foreign status opens the door to exclusive international schools in Beijing, where she lives with her husband, and the option for the child to study abroad for high school and college. There is one catch, though. Getting a U.S. passport for a baby means the child will eventually be responsible for U.S. taxes.

{"article":"(CNN)She is being called Zephany Nurse, though it is not the name with which the 17-year-old South African girl grew up. Zephany means \"hidden by the Lord,\" a fitting name for a girl who was allegedly kidnapped at birth and found thanks to an improbable coincidence. South African Police have been mostly quiet about the case. A police spokesman, Andre Traut, confirmed that a woman was arrested last week and charged with kidnapping and falsely pretending that she was the girl's biological mother. Zephany was a newborn when she was taken from a Cape Town hospital in 1997. She is 17 and in her final year of school. In fact, according to local reports, that's how she crossed paths with her biological parents, Celeste and Morne Nurse. According to the South African Press Association, an independent news agency, students at their second daughter's school unknowingly solved the kidnapping. The second daughter, who was born four years after Zephany was kidnapped, started eighth grade at a Cape Town school this year, according to SAPA. Fellow students told her there was a girl in her final year of school who looked just like her, the news agency reported. The two girls became friends, according to SAPA, and eventually, Morne Nurse made up an excuse to meet his daughter's new friend. He, too, was taken by the similarities and contacted the police, SAPA reported. A DNA test was done, and last week police arrested the 50-year-old woman who had raised Zephany. The woman made an initial appearance before a judge who ruled that she would remain behind bars at least until her next hearing. The shocking revelation has no easy conclusion. While Zephany's biological parents have said in interviews over the years that they never lost hope of finding her, for now, the girl is in the custody of the social services. The Nurses have been allowed to visit Zephany for short periods, South African media reported. And on Tuesday, Zephany herself released a statement, via the Centre for Child Law, which is representing her. \"I want to say thank you to all the people who supported me through this, for continuously praying and never giving up on looking for me,\" she said. \"Under the circumstances, I am doing fine.\"","highlights":"Celeste and Morne Nurse's baby was stolen from the hospital in 1997 .\n17 years later, their child has been found ."}
{"article":"(CNN)I like to think I'm a pretty optimistic person. Even at dark moments for this country -- after 9\/11 or Hurricane Katrina, for example -- my tendency is always to scout out the sliver of hope for future progress. But I've got to be honest with you, sometimes that optimism only goes so far. The morning after the 2004 election, when voters in 11 states passed constitutional bans on marriage equality,  I never thought I'd see committed and loving gay and lesbian couples getting married in my lifetime -- in Alabama of all places. What's more, I certainly never thought that, 50 years after a march for voting rights went from Selma to Montgomery, that the first couple to get married there would be a courageous African-American couple, Tori Sisson and Shant\u00e9 Wolfe, who camped out overnight on the sidewalk outside the courthouse just to be the first in line. They slept on that chilly pavement despite the ravings of Chief Justice Roy Moore of the Alabama Supreme Court, who has issued baseless edict after baseless edict urging the state's probate judges to ignore a federal court ruling (which supersedes a state ruling) and to refuse to treat LGBT people equally under the law. Even today, more than half the counties in the state are refusing to issue licenses to gay couples. In an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo on Thursday, Chief Justice Moore even compared refusing marriage licenses to gay couples to refusing to enforce the 1857 Dred Scott v. Sandford decision (which upheld the legal status of slaves as property). I'm not a trained lawyer, but the logic seems to be that the refusal to treat people like slaves under the law is similar to the refusal to grant gay and lesbians their equal rights to marry under the law. That logic is not only faulty (restricting rights is not similar to expanding them) but offensive. The 13 states that still ban same-sex marriage . Many are highlighting the echoes of the past in Alabama right now; of Gov. George Wallace actually blocking two African-American students from entering the auditorium of the University of Alabama as they tried to desegregate the school; of civil rights battles come and gone. Me? I'm focused on the future. In just a few months, the U.S. Supreme Court could end this chapter of our history once and for all. Even with Alabama entering the marriage equality column, there are still 13 states that deny these couples their equal rights. That's why this spring, the Supreme Court will hear a case that will determine whether the U.S. Constitution can tolerate that kind of discrimination. Federal judge: Alabama judges must issue gay marriage licenses . We've all got to raise our voices in support of couples like Tori and Shant\u00e9. But, after Bush v. Gore, Citizens United, and Shelby v. Holder, the case gutting the 1965 Voting Rights Act in 2013, sometimes it seems like the voices of the American people don't get heard by those nine Justices. That's why I'm so inspired and excited about a new idea from the Human Rights Campaign and Robbie Kaplan, the lawyer who represented Edie Windsor in the case that famously struck down the Defense of Marriage Act. Together, they've launched the People's Brief. The idea behind the People's Brief is an original twist on the legal concept of the \"amicus curiae\" (Latin for \"friend of the court.\") The legal system allows those who are not party to a case, but who have interests in the case, or information relevant to it, to submit their opinions, information, or testimony on the matter at hand. It's a way of guaranteeing that the court is not missing any relevant facts or opinions just because those who hold them are not parties to the litigation. The People's Brief marks the first time that the American people -- the 58% of Americans who support marriage equality, anyway -- can make their voices heard in an official brief to those justices. The People's Brief will serve as a poignant reminder to the Court that gay marriage is an issue that impacts the lives of both gay and straight, of those who are the family, friends, and loved ones of gay people, and of those who simply value a society where the rights of all people are treated with equal dignity. By going to www.thepeoplesbrief.com, you can sign your name, review the brief -- and it'll be bundled up with thousands of others and sent to those nine Justices for review. The number of people who sign the People's Brief will make that point in a way that no legal argument could. In past civil rights struggles, such as the one that took place half a century ago in Selma, Alabama, well-intentioned people far from the fray had no easy way to express their support. Now modern technology is being harnessed in a creative way to allow people to do just that in the struggle for marriage equality. I think that's pretty forward-thinking for a Court that still doesn't allow cameras or online case filings. In fact, I think it's long overdue. I've signed my name to the People's Brief, and I hope Americans from all backgrounds will do the same or just try to learn more about marriage equality. No one said progress is easy, but true social change is worth fighting for. Today, I'm optimistic that if change can come to Alabama, there is no reason why it can't come to all 50 states. Fair-minded folks shouldn't be silent at this moment. It's time to put your name on the right side of history. Lend your voice to a chorus too large to be ignored.","highlights":"Some judges in Alabama are opposing same-sex marriages .\nDonna Brazile: The U.S. Supreme Court should make a clear ruling in favor of gay marriage ."}
{"article":"(CNN)ISIS militants in northern Syria released 19 Assyrian Christian hostages Sunday, an activist group said. According to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, all but one of the hostages were among the at least 220 Assyrians captured on February 23 during an attack on villages in the northern Syrian province of al-Hasakah. The Syrian Observatory had said previously that a self-proclaimed ISIS court ordered the release of 29 Assyrian Christian hostages, citing an Assyrian commander. The reasoning behind the release was not immediately clear. It was also not clear why only 19 people were let go Sunday. The \"court\" told the commander that the fate of the other kidnapped Assyrians has yet to be decided by ISIS Sharia jurists. When the decision was announced that at least some of the hostages would be released, Graeme Wood, with The Atlantic, said he was pleased to hear about it, but not entirely surprised. \"ISIS has claimed for a long time to follow rules, and it claims that these Sharia courts will impose limits,\" he told CNN. \"They can attempt to get credibility by showing that they follow rules and that they have some kind of transparent process that follows their particular implementation of Sharia law.\" Also this weekend, the Syrian Observatory reported that ISIS has killed 1,969 people, since the declaration of its \"caliphate\" last June. Nearly two-thirds of them -- 1,238 people -- were civilians. Six were children and eight were women, the group said. Of the rest, 95 were fighters from the al Qaeda-affiliated rebel group al-Nusra Front, the Syrian Observatory said, and 511 were officers and soldiers of regime forces. ISIS also executed 125 of its own members for \"exceeding the limits in religion,\" the Syrian Observatory said. \"We in SOHR believe that the real number of people that had been killed by (ISIS) is higher than the number documented by SOHR because there are hundreds of missing and detainees inside the (ISIS) jails, loss of communication with about 1,000 men of al-Shaitaat tribe, (and) dozens of Kurds who have still been missing\" since ISIS attacked the Syrian town of Kobani in September. Samira Said reported from Abu Dhabi. Dana Ford reported and wrote from Atlanta.

{"article":"Washington (CNN)If it looks like a treaty, walks like a treaty and talks like a treaty, is it a treaty? According to the White House, only if the President of the United States says it is. That's infuriating Republicans and even some Democrats, who are demanding that the Obama administration submit any final nuclear deal with Iran to Congress for approval. \"This is clearly a treaty,\" Arizona Sen. John McCain told reporters Tuesday. \"They can call it a banana, but it's a treaty.\" Kerry denounces GOP letter to Iran leaders . The GOP position could jeopardize the long-term survival of any Iran deal, and it represents the party's newest clash with President Barack Obama over the limits of executive authority, as Republicans object to a pact they warn could eventually give Tehran a nuclear bomb. It's that skepticism that has largely led the White House to define the deal as a \"nonbinding agreement\" rather than a \"treaty,\" which the Constitution requires Senate \"advice and consent\" on. The distinction -- and whether it can legitimately be used to shut out Congress -- turns on complicated and unresolved questions of constitutional law. While Republicans call foul, the administration defends the differentiation as perfectly sound, and no surprise. Secretary of State John Kerry stressed Wednesday that the administration never intended to negotiate a treaty. \"We've been clear from the beginning. We're not negotiating a 'legally binding plan.' We're negotiating a plan that will have in it a capacity for enforcement,\" he said at a Senate hearing. That doesn't sit well with Republicans, many of whom believe the Senate's constitutional role is being bypassed. Idaho Sen. James Risch dismissed the administration's argument: \"Let there be no mistake, this is a treaty that is being negotiated. It's a treaty and should be treated as such.\" Did 47 Republican senators break the law in plain sight? Republicans see criticism of the administration's maneuver as a way to gum up the works on the current deal, and to push their larger assault on the White House's exercise of power. At the Senate hearing Wednesday, Kentucky Republican Rand Paul explicitly tied the administration's bid to keep the deal away from Congress to other accusations of White House overreach. \"This is an administration that seeks to legislate when that is not in their purview, whether it be immigration, whether it be health care,\" he charged, noting that he had joined 46 other GOP senators in signing a letter to the Islamic Republic informing them of Congress's role in approving binding agreements. \"I signed the letter to Iran. But you know what? The message I was sending was to you,\" he told Kerry. \"I signed it to an administration that doesn't listen, to an administration that, every turn, tries to go around Congress because you think you can't get your way.\" But legal experts say that though a court challenge along the lines of pending GOP cases on immigration and health care is possible in theory, it would be a long shot. There is no currently no suit on the issue being discussed on Capitol Hill, and it's far from clear that Republicans would be standing on firm legal ground with such a challenge. The debate, rumbling for decades, has yet to be definitively resolved in case law. \"It is a very interesting question,\" said Nicholas Burns, a former senior U.S. diplomat, arguing that it is essentially up to the administration to decide whether it is negotiating an agreement that formally binds the United States to commitments under international law; i.e., a treaty, or a less stringent arrangement. Senators grill Obama officials on Iran . Jim Walsh, a specialist on the Iran nuclear program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the Iran deal, which commits the United States to waive or lift sanctions, does not rise to the level of a formal treaty. \"Treaties traditionally have involved reductions in armaments, nuclear weapons, conventional forces. They require us to take something away that we have already built or established.\" In this case, the United States would lift sanctions, but would not be changing its military posture. \"We have had all sorts of agreement that were never ratified by Congress,\" Walsh said. But David Rivkin, a constitutional and international law expert who worked for President George H.W. Bush, said that any international agreement requiring major undertakings on the part of the United States -- such as the proposed Iran deal -- must be sent to the Senate for advice and consent. \"The Constitution is quite clear,\" he said. Republicans point to none less than the vice president of the United States to bolster their case. When Vice President Joe Biden was a senator in 2002, he wrote a letter to then-Secretary of State Colin Powell charging that a planned strategic arms reductions deal with Russia constituted a treaty subject to Senate approval since it would require \"significant obligations by the United States.\" But Biden's 2002 letter didn't keep him from unleashing his fury at the GOP letter to Iran on Monday. \"Around the world, America's influence depends on its ability to honor its commitments,\" Biden said in a statement. While Congress approves some agreements, \"as the authors of this letter must know, the vast majority of our international commitments take effect without congressional approval.\" Indeed, in the letter he penned to Iran, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton acknowledged that the administration could seek a mere \"executive agreement\" free of congressional review. Obama, Iranian official slam GOP letter on deal . Presidents claim inherent powers to conclude executive agreements under Article II of the Constitution. U.S. law stipulates that an agreement is only viewed as a treaty once it has been made with \"the advice and consent of the Senate,\" a study by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service noted. But administrations often choose to conclude deals with foreign states that don't satisfy that requirement. Such an \"executive agreement\" is still considered a treaty that is binding under international law, but does not reach the same standard under U.S. law, according to the study. Examples of \"nonbinding\" documents include a U.S.-Russia to remove Syria's stocks of chemical weapons and the Proliferation Security Initiative to stop the global shipment of the weapons of mass destruction components. Biden argued Monday that this practice is as old as the United States itself. \"Under presidents of both parties, such major shifts in American foreign policy as diplomatic recognition of the People's Republic of China, the resolution of the Iran hostage crisis, and the conclusion of the Vietnam War were all conducted without congressional approval,\" he said in his statement opposing the GOP letter. The White House would clearly prefer a binding agreement with Iran, which would have a better chance of longevity. But the strength of opposition in Congress makes that route impossible. According to Republicans such as Cotton, the only deal the Senate would approve is one that completely bans Iranian uranium enrichment. Obama has said that goal is simply not realistic. So Republicans, dissatisfied with what's emerging from negotiations, are seizing on the vulnerability of a deal that lacks treaty status. Many see that as a more viable path for disruption than the case on administration overreach. \"If Congress doesn't approve this deal, Congress won't accept this deal, now or in the future,\" Cotton told CNN. In the letter, he informed Iranian leaders that many senators will serve terms longer than Obama, so they would have to reckon with the Senate at some point. Lawmakers can refuse to lift sanctions down the road or try to choke off funds for the deal's implementation. The administration acknowledges that Congress will have to get involved at some point. Obama currently has the power to lift or waive certain sanctions against Iran for the duration of his presidency and encourage U.S. international partners to follow suit. But he does not have the power to lift sanctions imposed by Congress, which include some of the most punitive measures against Iran. \"Part of the agreement is going to involve sanctions relief to the Iranian government that is meted out over time,\" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told CNN. \"At some time in the duration of this agreement, Congress will have to be heard on sanctions relief.\" Senior U.S. officials have acknowledged that the clamor among lawmakers for a role, as well as their public criticisms, also implicitly highlights the vulnerability of their case and an ultimate agreement. Tim Kaine, a Democratic senator from Virginia who has signed onto a bill calling for the White House to put any deal up for a vote in Congress, said that Obama is within his rights to do what he is doing -- up to a point. \"It is not a treaty. If it were a treaty, there is a clear process. It would require a two-thirds vote in the Senate.\" But Kaine told CNN on Wednesday that lawmakers did have a role to play at the point when sanctions mandated by Congress are bargained away to ensure Iran sticks to limits on its nuclear program. \"Congress has got to weigh in at some point,\" Kaine said.","highlights":"White House, many Republicans disagree over deal terminology, requirements .\nAt some point, Congress will weigh in on some aspect of a prospective agreement ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Charlottesville Police said Monday that investigators found no \"substantive basis\" to support a University of Virginia female student's story that she was raped at the Phi Kappa Psi house, an account that Rolling Stone published last November. \"Jackie\" told the magazine that in late September 2012, she was assaulted at the house, the article said. Police Chief Tim  Longo noted that just because police found no evidence to support her account, \"That doesn't mean that something terrible didn't happen to Jackie\" on the day in question. Longo said he welcomed any information that might still be out there about the case. The Rolling Stone story generated controversy from the moment it came out, first sparking a debate about the prevalence of rape on college campuses throughout the country. But then the controversy turned toward the story's content when apparent contradictions and discrepancies in the article came to light. Rolling Stone said it did not get the accounts of those accused in the piece, and apologized. Editors vowed to conduct their own investigation, which is expected to be published in early April. Longo said Jackie did not give police a statement during their investigation. CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin said it's not unusual for a sexual assault victim to avoid the criminal process. \"Sometimes they can't deal with the probing that occurs. They don't want to submit to a rape kit. They're embarrassed. They know that they will be scrutinized, quite frankly. So that in and of itself ... doesn't make this young woman a liar,\" she said. Hostin pointed out that only about 2% of rapes that are reported are false, and only about 40% of rapes that occur are even reported: \"So the suggestion that she just sort of made this entire thing up flies in the face of the statistics.\" Nine out of 11 people at the fraternity house at the time the sexual assault allegedly occurred talked to police, Longo said. None of them said they knew about a rape, he said, and investigators further determined that it was unlikely a party even happened at the fraternity house on the day in question as was alleged in the Rolling Stone story. The Rolling Stone reporter, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, talked to police, authorities said, but there were some questions she declined to answer for journalistic reasons. It's unclear what those questions were. In total, authorities spoke to 70 people as part of their investigation, and just two believed that Jackie was the victim of something, Capt. Gary Pleasants told CNN's \"Erin Burnett OutFront.\" \"The two of them were fairly convinced that something had happened -- not the way it was described, the way it was written. But they thought, again, that something had probably occurred,\" he said. After the story's publication, UVA suspended the fraternity's activities, and outrage spread throughout campus as many struggled to comprehend the horrific experience that Jackie said she endured. The article also suggested the school failed to respond to the alleged assault. Phi Kappa Psi released a statement Monday, saying the \"discredited\" story has done significant damage, while acknowledging the \"importance of sexual assault issues on America's college campuses.\" The fraternity asked Rolling Stone to \"fully and unconditionally retract its story.\" Rolling Stone editors said they chose not to contact the man who allegedly orchestrated the attack on Jackie, or any of the men she said participated in her alleged assault, \"because the editors feared retaliation against her,\" the magazine said, adding that it regretted that decision. \"In the face of new information, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie's account, and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced,\" Rolling Stone said in December. Rolling Stone Managing Editor Will Dana later tweeted that \"the truth would have been better served by getting the other side of the story.\" Rolling Stone issued an apology for discrepancies in its article and began to fact-check it. Steve Coll, dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, has been leading the independent review, CNN senior media correspondent Brian Stelter reported Sunday. Stelter said there has been much speculation about Coll's findings. Columbia University's review will be published in early April in the magazine. \"I can't really say I'm surprised since so much of the evidence was already called into question,\" a former friend of Jackie's said in response to what police found. \"I think it's great that they're staying open to considering any new evidence that comes up.\" Ryan Duffin added: \"I've resigned myself to realize that I might never know what did or didn't happen.\" CNN's Sara Ganim and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","highlights":"Police: No evidence found to support claims made by UVA student that she was raped .\nAn independent review by a journalism school dean is underway ."}

{"article":"The rumbling discontent among Everton fans towards manager Roberto Martinez is gathering momentum after Wednesday night's dismal 2-0 defeat at Stoke City left last season's Champions League challengers just six points above the relegation zone. After one win in 12 games and only one clean sheet away from Goodison Park since September, it is becoming common to hear fans complain that the Spaniard is 'turning us into Wigan'. The statistics actually bear out their worst fears. In Martinez's last season at Wigan, he had 30 points from 30 games \u2013 and went down. Everton currently have 28 points from 28 matches. Everton manager Roberto Martinez and his team look lost in the Barclays Premier League of late . Everton's underperforming stars now just sit six points above the relegation zone in the Premier League . Victor Moses (left) scored in Stoke City's 2-0 win over Everton at the Britannia Stadium on Wednesday night . The Europa League, the source of so much pride earlier in the season, is now looking like an unwanted distraction. Everton face Dynamo Kyiv at Goodison on Thursday before their now-crucial next league match against Newcastle United on Sunday. The following week they have to contend with a 3,000-mile round trip to Ukraine for the second leg. The players may not get into their beds until 4am on the Friday morning, just 60 hours before they take to the pitch at Loftus Road for what, inconceivably, could be billed a relegation six-pointer against QPR. So what has gone wrong at Everton \u2013 a club who finished fifth last season and were tipped to be fighting it out with Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool at the top. Here are eight reasons why Everton are fighting to stay in the top flight, where they've been since 1954. THE \u00a328MILLION NON-TALISMAN . In retrospect, Romelu Lukaku was foolish to declare he wanted to become the world's best player when he hit a purple patch on loan last season. Everton smashed their transfer record to make a \u00a328million move from Chelsea permanent in the summer, a deal that now makes Jose Mourinho look a genius. Lukaku has scored just seven Premier League goals, fewer than West Ham's Diafra Sakho who cost less than a quarter that amount. Lukaku's notorious first touch looks as if it is getting worse, not better, and he has complained Everton's style is not direct enough to get the best out of him. Romelu Lukaku declared he wanted to be the world's best player last season but he has been far from it . Martinez must be desperate to find a way to help re-find his \u00a328million centre forward's best form . Lukaku's first touch has always had a bad reputation but it has proved even more of a problem this season . MARTINEZ TOO SOFT . Martinez believes in filling his players with confidence and it makes him look a great man-manager when things are going well. But salty old professionals like Sylvain Distin, with whom he has fallen out, Phil Jagielka and Tony Hibbert have been around long enough to realise that a good old-fashioned rollocking is needed at times. David Moyes wasn't always popular with the Everton players but Martinez could do with handing out a few home truths like the Scot did. Phil Jagielka (left) and Tony Hibbert (right) have been at Everton for years and understand the way things work . Martinez has fallen out with\u00a0Sylvain Distin but the defender knows that on occasion players need a rollocking . THE DISAPPEARING ROSS BARKLEY . Valued at \u00a360million not so long ago and feted by Martinez as potentially the best English player of all time, 21-year-old Barkley has started just over half of the club's Premier League games this season, 15 of 28. At Stoke when Martinez had one last substitution to use to try and salvage a result, he turned to Kevin Mirallas, rather than the supposed heir to Paul Gascogine. Barkley has played in so many different positions this season \u2013 holding midfield, out wide, No10 \u2013 he looks confused. Ross Barkley was left on the bench on Wednesday night, even when Everton were searching for a goal . Barkley was lauded by Martinez as potentially the best English player of all-time but he hasn't progressed . INJURIES . One of the reasons Everton are ultimately likely to get out of trouble is that important members of the old guard are heading back. Leon Osman tasted his first Premier League action since early December on Wednesday night after a serious foot injury and his knowhow will be vital. Even more importantly, Leighton Baines \u2013 the best left back in the Premier League \u2013 is pencilled in to face Newcastle having missed six games with a knee injury. Aiden McGeady and Steven Pienaar are also out while Darron Gibson's midweek appearance was his first PL start for nearly two years. Leighton Baines - the best left back in the Premier League - will be a huge boost on return from injury . Leon Osman is also returning to the first-team fold and could be a key man in Everton's run-in . LOAN PROBLEMS . Traditionally, Roberto Martinez has one of the best records in the loan market. Tom Cleverley enjoyed the best spell of his career at Wigan and last season Gareth Barry and Lukaku were big hits at Goodison. But the Midas touch seems to have deserted him. Christian Atsu has hardly had a kick since he joined from Chelsea and Aaron Lennon was woeful and substituted after an hour at Stoke. Tom Cleverley (left) was well managed by Martinez during his loan spell at Wigan which saw him hit top form . By contrast, Christian Atsu has hardly had a kick since signing a season-long loan deal from Chelsea . Aaron Lennon came in on loan from Tottenham but he was woeful at the Britannia Stadium on Wednesday . IT'S ALL ATTACK, AND NO DEFENCE . Martinez earned a reputation for concentrating too much on his attacking play at Wigan and history is in danger of repeating itself at Everton. Despite inheriting a strong back-five from Moyes, Everton have looked less and less certain at the back, and the collywobbles have effected goalkeeper Tim Howard, who has gone from World Cup superstar to dodgy keeper this season. The repetitive defensive drills under Moyes were boring but they did serve a purpose. Tim Howard was brilliant at the World Cup but he has had troubles in the Everton goal this season . David Moyes employed repetitive defensive drills at Everton - but they did the trick for his side . EURO DISTRACTION . Getting the balance right between Europe and the Premier League has foxed a lot of managers over the years. Martinez seemed to be on a winner earlier in the season with his fondness for team rotation helping the club qualify for the knock-out stages in Europe while holding head above water in the league. But the regular changes have affected rhythm in recent weeks and the league form has dropped alarmingly. Everton were flying high when they won away in Wolfsburg but the rotation for Europe has had an effect . BARRY GAMBLE HAS BACKFIRED . Gareth Barry has been one of the Premier League's most consistent midfield players over the last 15 years but at the age of 34, he is becoming to look a liability. Everton decided to sign him on a permanent basis last summer but his most notable contribution this season is to have broken the all-time Premier League record for yellow cards. His caution at Stoke on Wednesday \u2013 number 106 \u2013 has earned him a two-match ban and that might prove a blessing in disguise. Gareth Barry has been a consistent performer for 15 years but now looks like a liability in midfield . Barry's caution on Wednesday night was his 106th in the Premier League - an all-time record for any player .","highlights":"Everton are just six points above relegation in the Barclays Premier League .\nThey lost 2-0 to Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium on Wednesday night .\nRoberto Martinez has incurred the wrath of the fans for their decline .\nRomelu Lukaku has looked nothing like the on-loan player of last year .\nRoss Barkley is barely in the Everton side and has been overlooked .\nMembers of Everton's old guard have had injury problems .\nGareth Barry is looking like a liability in the heart of the midfield ."}
{"article":"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)The U.S. military is in the process of evacuating about 100 Special Operations forces members from the Al Anad airbase in Yemen due to that country's deteriorating security situation, sources in the region familiar with the situation told CNN. Those being evacuated are the last American troops stationed in the Arab nation, which is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terrorist group also known as AQAP. The United States closed its embassy in Sanaa last month, after Houthi rebels took over the Yemeni capital. And hundreds of al Qaeda members escaped two Yemeni prisons Thursday and Friday, raising further security questions. For years, the U.S. military has worked closely with Yemen's government to go after AQAP, together carrying out numerous attacks like the 2011 drone strike that killed prominent al Qaeda figure Anwar al-Awlaki. And U.S. President Barack Obama has hailed this cooperation as a pillar in his anti-terrorism campaign. \"Yemen has never been a perfect democracy or a island of stability,\" Obama said in January, promoting the policy of \"partnering and intelligence-sharing with that local government\" as the best approach in a bad situation. \"The alternative would be for us to play whack-a-mole every time there is a terrorist actor inside of any given country,\" the President said. But while there have been drone strikes as recently as last month, these cooperative efforts have been hampered by Yemen's growing difficulty in maintaining unity and peace. These include the rise of the Houthis, their battles with forces loyal to ousted President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi and the presence of not only al Qaeda fighters but other militants. On Friday, for instance, ISIS purportedly claimed responsibility for bombings at two mosques in Sanaa what, if true, would mark that group's first large-scale attack in Yemen. The claim came in a statement posted on a site that previously carried ISIS proclamations, but couldn't be immediately authenticated by CNN. Those blasts killed at least 137 people and wounded 357 others, according to Yemen's state-run Saba news agency. While ISIS and al Qaeda are both Sunni groups that espouse extreme versions of Islam and violent opposition to the West, that doesn't mean they will be working together anytime soon. In fact, AQAP strongly rebuked ISIS in a video released in November, characterizing its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's declaration of an Islamic caliphate as illegitimate. More than anything, the idea of the group calling itself the Islamic State violently flexing its muscles speaks to the chaotic situation there. With no one really in control, that means numerous groups -- including those with a history of killing civilians and lashing out at the West -- have been more room to operate and a better chance potentially to take over. Meanwhile, the main players for control of Yemen's government -- those siding with Hadi, who still claims to be president after being deposed earlier this year, and the Houthis, a minority group that's strongest in the northern part of the country -- remain very much at odds. Just two days ago, a Yemeni jet commanded by the capital's Houthi conquerors fired missiles at a palace housing Hadi in the port city of Aden. No one was injured, but the direct strike nonetheless marked an escalation in the deadly fighting between the two sides. The airstrikes came on the same day opposing Yemeni military forces -- some under the Houthis, others led by officers loyal to Hadi -- battled in Aden, said Aden Gov. AbdulAziz Hobtour. At least 13 people died and 21 others were injured in those clashes, according to Hobtour. Hadi took to the airwaves of Adan TV, a station he recently started, on Saturday in his first televised speech since escaping house arrest. He called on all political factions to take part in upcoming talks in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, condemning the Aden strike and urging Yemeni troops to refuse orders from Houthi officials. Hadi tied the Houthis to Iran, which he was said supported the \"coup\" that led to his departure from Aden. \"The Iranian agenda of the Houthis will not last,\" he said. Needless to say, the Houthis aren't convinced. Mohammed Al Bukhaiti, a top member of the Houthi Political Council, said Hadi's speech won't help Yemen reach a peaceful resolution and accused him of reneging on a deal last September to transfer power. \"We blame Hadi for not implementing this deal that drew the road map that would have solved Yemen's ongoing crises,\" Al Bukhaiti said. \"Hadi will be held responsible for the country's failures and that chaos that could follow.\" Journalist Hakim Almasmari reported from Sanaa, and CNN's Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta.","highlights":"Yemen's deposed president lashes out at Houthi rebels in a speech .\nSources: U.S. special operations forces are being evacuated from  Al Anad airbase .\nThe U.S. military had worked with Yemen's government to go after terrorists there ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Tunisia's tourism industry has been thrown into disarray by a terror attack on Wednesday that left at least 17 foreign visitors dead and prompted urgent warnings over security. Only just recovering from the impact of the Arab Spring uprisings four years ago, Tunisia has once again emerged as a winter sun draw for tens of thousands of travelers. But following Wednesday's attack and siege at the prestigious Bardo Museum in central Tunis, the country's tourism industry is once again facing jeopardy even as authorities and operators scramble to ensure the safety of visitors currently in the country. A significant number of foreign tourists were inside the museum at the time of the attack, which government officials said was the work of \"Islamists.\" Prime Minister Habib Essid said Polish, Italian, German and Spanish tourists are among those killed, with another 20 tourists plus two Tunisians wounded in the attack. MSC Cruises said its ship, MSC Splendida, is currently docked in the Tunis port of La Goulette and some of its passengers had been on tours of the city, including the Bardo at the time of the attack. \"All the tourist coaches on tour were immediately recalled to the port and all other tours on the ground were immediately suspended,\" MSC said in a statement. Another ship, the Costa Fascinosa, docked in Tunis at that time, has a manifest of more than 3,000 passengers, its parent company Costa Cruise said. As details of the incident emerged, several foreign governments put out warnings urging their citizens to stay away from the scene of the attacks, around an area that includes the national parliament building. The U.S. Embassy in Tunis issued an alert that also reiterated standing advice about the potential for violence in Tunisia and the risk of kidnappings. Its warning cautions against trips to Tunisia's central, southern and border regions. Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) also urged UK citizens to stay away from the affected areas of Tunis and to \"follow the instructions of Tunisian security authorities.\" Its warning also carried longstanding advice: \"There is a high threat from terrorism, including kidnapping. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including places visited by foreigners.\" With tens of thousands of foreign visitors likely to be in Tunisia right now and many more contemplating travel there, travel operators have been rushing to formulate a response to the attack. It's not immediately known if flights will be added to accommodate any sudden surge in departures or whether tour operators will pull out of the country -- responses that followed a terror attack in Kenya last year. Thomson and First Choice, a UK-based travel operator that carries thousands of vacationers on package trips to Tunisia, said it had canceled organized excursions to Tunis as a precaution. A statement said it would follow FCO advice, which overall remained unchanged for Tunisia. \"Thomson and First Choice customers stay in beach destinations, not Tunis, and we can confirm that none of our customers or staff were affected by the incident that took place there today,\" it said. \"As a precaution however we have canceled excursions to Tunis for the coming days. \"Customer safety is of paramount importance to us and we continue to work closely with the FCO and the British Consulate to monitor the situation. Tunisia remains a popular destination for us and customers are enjoying their holidays as normal.\" In its advisory, the UK Foreign Office points out \"424,707 British nationals visited Tunisia in 2014. Most British tourists stay in the coastal resorts and most visits are trouble free.\" Indeed, Tunisia's largely unsullied reputation as a safe north African destination for Europeans seeking low coast beach breaks has clawed back some of the popularity it enjoyed before 2011. In 2010, the country welcomed 6.9 million tourists to its beach resorts and numerous historic sites. In 2011, the year in which an uprising ousted longtime President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali -- an event credited with triggering the Arab Spring -- that number fell below 4.8 million. With calm restored in recent years -- despite security concerns from neighboring Libya and ongoing political tensions -- those numbers have been on the rise, helped by costly advertising campaigns. Recently reported statistics put visitor numbers still 10% lower than their pre-2011 levels, but numbers had been expected to rise again -- particularly with a new \"Star Wars\" film renewing interest in the country's role as a key location in the original movies. In a 2013 interview, Tunisian tourism minister Jamel Gamra said up to 20% of Tunisia's population -- equivalent to 2 million people -- relied on the tourism industry. He told the Inter Press Service he was optimistic that visitor numbers would continue to grow. \"The sector has big potential and we aim to reach 10 million tourists by 2016, a growth of one million tourists per year,\" he said. \"Tunisia also has more freedom and democracy now, which is very important for economic growth and prosperity and has a positive effect on the tourism industry.\"","highlights":"Gunmen killed 17 tourists and two others on Wednesday at a museum in Tunisia's capital .\nU.S., UK and other foreign governments have issued travel warnings .\nTourism numbers had been increasing in Tunisia in recent years, following downturn after 2011 Arab Spring unrest ."}
{"article":"(CNN)All you need is luck, to misquote one of Liverpool's most famous exports, The Beatles. But Liverpool's footballers won't mind one bit that a fortunate goal sealed a vital win at Swansea to set up a pivotal clash with Manchester United at the weekend. One of English soccer's biggest rivalries is renewed on Sunday with vital points at stake in the race for a place in next season's European Champions League. Jordan Henderson knew little about his winner in Wales, the ball flying in after Jordi Amat's clearance struck him, but it helped make it seven wins out of eight for the Reds. A sixth consecutive clean sheet away from home pulled it within two points of Manchester United in fourth, with just four points separating Liverpool from Manchester City in second. \"It's a great result,\" Henderson told Sky Sports. \"The first half was disappointing but I felt as though we did better in second half, passed the ball and created a few chances. \"It was a great pass by Daniel, I got a little fortunate with the finish but you've got to be in the right position to score. \"Overall we're delighted with three points and we now look forward to Sunday. We can't wait for it, we are high on confidence and have great momentum but United played well the other day. \"It'll be a tough one but at Anfield we go in confident and hopefully we'll get the result we need.\" In a lackluster start, Daniel Sturridge dragged a shot wide of post for Liverpool before England international Adam Lallana fired a fierce half-volley right at Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. From then on Swansea asserted control. Martin Skrtel had to be alert to clear as Swansea's French striker Bafetimbi Gomis -- starting for the first time since collapsing on the pitch at Tottenham earlier this month -- headed at goal. Gomis then played a neat one-two with Wayne Routledge before forcing Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet into a fine low save. Next to threaten Liverpool's net was Iceland international Gylfi Sigurdsson, whose effort was arrowing for the top corner before Mignolet intervened. Just before halftime Jonjo Shelvey, a former Liverpool player, went close with a shot from a right wing corner that was deflected wide by Alberto Moreno. But having had a chance to regroup, Liverpool came out galvanized after the break and were soon on the front foot. First Fabianski made a brilliant save to keep out Philippe Coutinho's near post effort before the Pole was then in action again to deny Joe Allen. Though Liverpool were in the ascendency, its opening goal was down to a stroke of luck. As Henderson galloped onto a through ball Swansea's Spanish defender Amat got there first, but his clearance ricocheted off the Liverpool player and into the net past Fabianski. From then on Liverpool did a fine job of squeezing the life out of the game and playing on the counter, striker Daniel Sturridge hitting the post late on as Swansea left gaps at the back.

{"article":"Emotional France coach Philippe Saint-Andre has launched a scathing attack on his own players following Saturday's lackluster 20-13 defeat to Wales in the Six Nations, saying the team has become 'the Father Christmas of international rugby' because it gives away so many points. His voice trembling with emotion, Saint-Andre looked on the verge of tears Sunday as he made it clear he feels extremely let down. 'International rugby is about combat, humility. But above all it's a collective sport. We don't need starlets,' he said.' In rugby, the team is the star and we need champions. Yesterday, I didn't see any champions, or not many.' Saint-Andre looked on the verge of tears Sunday as he made it clear he feels extremely let down . Brice Dulin scores a try for France during the RBS Six Nations match against Wales at the Stade de France . France, which has lost its past four games to Wales in the tournament, lost 18-11 to Ireland and narrowly beat Scotland at home in its opener. Next up is a tricky away match in Italy followed by a full-blooded showdown with England at Twickenham. Flyhalf Camille Lopez was particularly poor, missing two of his four penalty kicks - and Yoann Huget's first-half try was ruled out because of Lopez's careless forward pass. 'For my part, I don't think I played badly,' a defiant Lopez said. 'I tried different things ... Let's keep on daring.' France's scrum-half Sebastien Tillous-Borde is joined by the rest of his dejected teammates at full time . His attitude may not have pleased Saint-Andre, who is likely to make sweeping changes for the game against Italy in two weeks' time. Asked if some players are now playing for their futures, six months ahead of the World Cup, Saint-Andre replied with an emphatic 'yes' - although he stopped short of saying some would never play for France again under his leadership. 'I only want players who are ready to go to the end of the world. If anyone thinks that international rugby is too difficult, then they have my telephone number,' he said. 'They can call me and I'll take someone else. I'll even take a 20-year-old lad who's never played in the Top 14 (French league) before.' Morgan Parra  in action during the RBS Six Nations rugby match between France and Wales . Saint-Andre, one of France's best wingers, took over after the 2011 World Cup, where France lost 8-7 to New Zealand in a tense final. Almost all of that side has gone and Saint-Andre has been rebuilding ever since, although his habit of constantly tinkering with the side has not helped instill continuity. But he feels the players should take more responsibility and show more pride. 'I've covered and supported them for three years. At some stage you need to know how to win games at the highest level,' he said. 'The French jersey should not only be something you're proud of but also something that enables you to surpass yourself. You need to be a gladiator. It's thumbs up for Wales star Jamie Roberts after their win against France at the Stade de France . 'We've lost four in a row to the Welsh, this has to stop. We have guys who started playing (regularly) three years ago and now have 30 caps. It's time to stop hiding.' An irate Saint-Andre raised his voice several times during a passionate news conference. 'At some point you have to ask the right questions. We're at our level, that's the truth,' he said. 'It takes the Welsh 30 seconds to score three points and it takes us four minutes. We're the Father Christmas of international rugby and that's what I told the players.' However, Saint-Andre is no mood to quit. 'I've never abandoned ship, whether as a player, as a captain or as a manager. I've been given a role: to prepare this team for the World Cup,' he said. 'I'll fight every day to do that.'

{"article":"(CNN)If you enjoy laughing at the England football team -- calling all Germans and Scots -- and you have a spare $900,000, then Sotheby's has the very thing for you. The auction house is offering an untitled work by Italian sculptor Maurizio Cattelan that chronicles -- in painstaking and painful detail if you are English -- every defeat suffered by the England team between 1874 and 1998. Cattelan has carved all the defeats into a large (and it would have to be, wouldn't it?) piece of black granite, meaning the lucky buyer can be constantly reminded of a succession of ignominious afternoons and evenings. The artist says of his memorial stone-style work simply: \"I guess it's a piece which talks about pride, missed opportunities and death.\" Known for his humorous and satirical art, Cattelan had plenty to work with as he recorded defeats starting with a 2-1 loss to Scotland in Glasgow in 1874 and ending with another 2-1 setback against Romania at the 1998 World Cup. Since then, of course, he'd have had a fair few more to immortalize, including the two to Italy and Uruguay in Brazil last summer that were part of the worst-ever England display at a World Cup. The artist, whose other works include La Nona Ora (The Ninth Hour), which depicts Pope John Paul II being struck down by a meteorite, first put his football piece on display at an exhibition in London in 1999. It's not known whether any England managers and players, past or present, came along to have a sneaky look. Current England boss Roy Hodgson is known to be a bit of an Italophile, but the former Inter Milan coach needs to be quick if he wants catch a glimpse -- Cattelan's work is on public exhibition at Sotheby's New Bond Street galleries until Tuesday 10 March. It will then be offered as part of the single-owner 'Bear Witness' sale.","highlights":"A monument to England's football failure is set to go on auction in London .\nMaurizio Cattelan's sculpture chronicles every England defeat between 1874 and 1998 .\nThe black granite artwork is expected to fetch up to $900,000 ."}
{"article":"Ofcom is to canvas the views of thousands of football fans as it probes a complaint by Virgin Media about the way \u00a31.7 billion-a-year Premier League football rights are sold to broadcasters. Armchair supporters and regular match-goers are to be asked for their views as part of the regulator's inquiry. Ofcom also said it would be looking at changes in the prices charged by broadcasters for sports channels. BT Sport share the rights with Sky to broadcast Premier League football throughout the season . The regulator is in the midst of an investigation after Virgin argued that the English top flight screened fewer live matches than other top European leagues, contributing to higher prices for pay-TV packages. In an update published on Monday, it said that its probe continued to progress with no decisions reached at this stage and that it was reviewing consumer research it had recently received from Virgin Media. It added: 'Ofcom will also carry out new consumer research, which will canvas views of fans who attend matches and those who watch them on TV. Thierry Henry (left) and Jamie Carragher are part of the star-studded team Sky Sports employ as pundits . 'It will look at the value viewers place on watching the Premier League. We will also be monitoring changes in retail prices of sports channels as the investigation progresses.' The fans' research will build on views already sought from football bodies, clubs, fans' groups, broadcasters and policing organisations. Virgin had argued that the latest Premier League rights auction should be suspended as Ofcom probed the process, but the regulator declined and allowed the sale to go ahead last month. Virgin Media are unhappy with the way the Premier League sell their rights for such a huge price . It resulted in Sky and BT paying a combined \u00a35.14 billion to screen top-flight games for the 2016-2019 seasons, a 70 per cent increase on the current deal. Ofcom said prior to the auction that there was no 'urgent need' to delay it and that it was carrying out its probe 'expeditiously' given that the auctioned matches will start to be broadcast from August 2016. It said it had the power necessary to alter broadcasting arrangements before this time, should its probe find there had been an infringement of competition rules.","highlights":"Premier League fans to have the chance to give their views on the way football rights are sold to TV companies like Sky Sports and BT .\nVirgin Media launched a complaint over the way they are dealt with .\nSky and BT \u00a0paid a combined \u00a35.14billion to screen top-flight games .\nClick here for all the latest Premier League news ."}
{"article":"Manchester United starlet Adnan Januzaj is prepared to play in any position to be given more opportunities under Louis van Gaal. The 20-year-old made his breakthrough last season in one of the few highlights of David Moyes' ill-fated reign at Old Trafford, but has been used sparingly by Van Gaal this term as the Dutchman prefers to play a 3-5-2 system without orthodox wingers. The young Belgian has started just eight games from 18 appearances this term but is prepared to play a variety of attacking roles. Louis van Gaal (right) speaks with Adnan Januzaj who has had is chances at United \u00a0limited this season . The young Belgian, who has started just eight games from 18 appearances this term, replaces Angel di Maria . 'My game is all about trying to make things happen,' Januzaj told the club's official website. 'We had the diamond at Cambridge and I played as a left-midfielder. I feel comfortable there as well. I think I can play well there without a problem. 'My favourite position is as a winger or a no.10.

Januzaj shares a joke with United team-mates (L-R)\u00a0Andreas Pereira, Juan Mata and Ander Herrera . The 20-year-old insists he can 'make things happen' from a variety of attacking positions . United, the former dominant force in the Premier League, have been criticised for not challenging for the title in Van Gaal's first season, although Januzaj insists a return to the Champions League was always a priority. 'I think that's the aim \u2013 to try to qualify for next year's Champions League,' he added. 'I played in it last year and it was very good to do so. I was really happy and you know you're waiting for that kind of opportunity again in the future.'","highlights":"Belgium star has started only eight games in 18 appearances this season .\nManager Louis van Gaal prefers using a 3-5-2 system at Manchester United .\nAdnan Januzaj is prepared to play in a variety of attacking roles ."}
{"article":"Paul Ince says son Tom would love to play for England in the future and insists the decision to make himself unavailable for the Under 21s was taken for the good of his career. In an exclusive interview with Sportsmail, the former England captain \u2013 who has 53 caps \u2013 has hit back at claims Tom \u2018snubbed\u2019 his country and that his international career is in ruins. Gareth Southgate revealed on Thursday that the Hull winger \u2013 currently on loan at Derby \u2013 had told him he did not want to be considered for this summer\u2019s European Championships. Tom Ince has been left out of the latest England Under 21 squad by Gareth Southgate at his own request . Ince (right) is currently on loan from Hull City at Championship side Derby County . The Three Lions boss said he was \u2018surprised and disappointed\u2019 following conversations with the 23-year-old and his father, his former England team-mate. But Ince Snr says his son needs a period of rest if he is to get his career in the Premier League back on track \u2013 and that is their prime focus heading into next season. \u2018Tom has played 18 times for the Under 21s and really enjoyed it and found it beneficial \u2013 so this is not a snub, that\u2019s rubbish,\u2019 said Ince, who was England\u2019 s first black skipper. \u2018He is 23 years of age and has already played in the Euros in Israel. He has experienced that, which was great. \u2018If he was 20 years old we would not be having this conversation, he would be going to the Euros, no doubt about it. \u2018But the last year or so from a club point of view has been difficult for him. He\u2019s been all over the place. He went to Hull last summer and has then been on loan at Forest and Derby, where he\u2019s doing well now. \u2018We forget that he had three years at Blackpool pretty much playing by himself at a young age, and that had an effect. \u2018He needs to get a good rest and make sure he is ready to go next season. He needs to start finding some stability. He needs to get himself in a position to play regular football in the Premier League.\u2019 England captain Paul Ince has his head bandaged and shirt covered in blood during a World Cup qualifier against Italy in Rome in 1997 . Ince (right) played under his father Paul while at Blackpool in the Championship . The aim, then, is to make an impact at the KC Stadium next season before bidding for a senior call-up with England. \u2018Listen, Tom has not snubbed his country. It is the pinnacle of a player\u2019s career to represent your country,\u2019 Ince added. \u2018I was captain and am immensely proud of my 53 caps. \u2018Gareth Southgate said we should be aware of the repercussions. I don\u2019t agree. If Tom is playing regularly next year for Hull and scoring goals like he is for Derby, then he would love to get an England call-up. \u2018And if he is doing that I see no reason why Roy Hodgson shouldn\u2019t call him up. He\u2019s got a good young squad and Tom would love to be part of it in the future. \u2018But first of all he needs to get his club career in order. We have looked at the bigger picture. He needs a steady period and he needs to hit the ground running next season. Ince (second right) celebrates with goalscorer Harry Kane (right) during the U21 clash with France last year . Gareth Southgate said Ince should be aware of the repercussions following his decision . \u2018If he makes his mark at Hull next year then hopefully we\u2019ll see the benefit of this decision. \u2018So there is no way I\u2019m saying to Tom, \u201cDon\u2019t play for England\u201d. As a father I would love my son to do what I did and play for his country. \u2018There are other kids coming through who are 20 and 21 and they will be at the tournament - Tom is 23. \u2018And don\u2019t forget he could also be in the play-offs with Derby, as he was with Blackpool. There would be no time for rest. \u2018We have to be careful and think about the future.\u2019","highlights":"Tom Ince made himself available for England Under 21 side .\nFather Paul insists his son made the decision for his career .\n23-year-old Ince currently on loan at Derby County from Hull ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Robots serve you drinks, you can skydive on deck and a mechanical arm hoists you 300 feet into the air to view the ship. You could be forgiven for thinking you had been transported into the future on board the new $1 billion cruise ship Quantum of the Seas. As its name suggests, it is very much a quantum leap in boat building. The latest brainchild of Royal Caribbean, which has branded the newest member of its fleet the \"smartest cruise ship in history,\" it is basically a fun palace on the high seas. Everything, it seems, is a first: the first bumper cars, skydive simulator and bionic bar on a ship. And among the 19 restaurants on board, there is something for everyone. Those of a literary slant can even dine at Wonderland, with waitresses dressed up in characters from the novel by Lewis Carroll. Such are the maverick creations on board from bow to stern, it is a vessel befitting of the Mad Hatter. \"This is the smartest cruise ship,\" says Harri Kulovaara, executive vice-president of maritime at Royal Caribbean and head of the design process behind the project. \"This is probably going to be a big change for the industry and the future.\" And this is not just Royal Caribbean's prediction. \"It's unique and unusual, and we just had fun -- pure and simple,\" is the assessment of Carolyn Spencer Brown, the editor of Cruise Critic, after spending eight days on Quantum. \"Royal Caribbean are always raising the bar when it comes to putting stuff on board you'd never thought you'd see on a cruise ship. \"They just do things well before anyone else and their ships are traditionally the ones you get most excited about,\" adds Spencer Brown, who estimates she has been on 300 cruises as part of her job. \"You keep on thinking when they come up with something crazy they've hit the wall and there can't be anything new, but there always is. They keep doing things no-one else has thought of.\" There are bigger cruise ships out there: Allure and Oasis -- both part of the Royal Caribbean fleet -- although not quite with the same box of tricks. Kulovaara likes to think Quantum has something for everyone -- it even has its own \"godmother,\" American actress Kristin Chenoweth. But what exactly does a price tag of nearly $1 billion buy you? The vessel is 16 stories high, has room for 4,500 passengers and a 1,500-strong crew. It also boasts 18 decks, 2,090 state rooms, is the length of 41 London buses and weighs 167,800 tonnes. Built in Meyer Werft shipyard in Papenburg, Germany, its first voyage at the end of last year was from Southampton to New York, and an eight-day Caribbean cruise on board starts from $1,333. The project was first discussed in 2009 and the build took three and a half years. Finland-born Kulovaara, now based in Miami, takes great pride in the fact the vessel was delivered just two minutes late. Kulovaara, who has been with the company since 1995, is proud of the open-thinking mentality that appears to have gone into the design process. \"I don't remember any major elements that we did not get on the ship,\" he says. \"It's come together nicely. We have a group of people that love to innovate and look to the future. With this, we started to think about the next generation. \"When we start a new design, we think of the customer and what can we do. We put the customer right in there. How can we provide a better vacation? We constantly explore novel options, what's possible on a ship. We have people pushing innovation that just have that in their DNA.\" That involves bringing partners on board, including the team behind RipCord by iFly -- provider of skydiving on the deck in an enclosed capsule -- which has long been a company aspiration. \"We've actively looked at having that on board before the technology was not enclosed and also too noisy,\" adds Kulovaara, who spent his childhood summers sailing in the Finnish Arctic. \"The technology moved on and the energy could be used in a constant loop so there wasn't such wasted energy.\" It was the same for the North Star, a capsule -- modeled on the London Eye -- that gives holiday makers a 360-degree view of the deck but can also protrude over the side of the boat with just the sea below. It is not something for vertigo sufferers. \"North Star looks simple but it's very complex so adding to the ship design was huge,\" explains Kulovaara, who says he only got involved in studying naval architecture in order to make him a better yachtsman. \"Some of our best resources were working on that for 18 months before the product was started.\" At the Bionic Bar, passengers can order drinks by iPad and watch as huge bionic arms make any beverage of their choosing. The tech thrills don't end there: Kulovaara claims Quantum has the most advanced WiFi on board any ship. He says the connectivity, set up by O3b, is as fast as logging on at home or at work -- achieved by using a satellite in much lower orbit than would normally be the case. \"It's comparable to anything on land, so this is a revolution.\" The company is confident it is winning the cruise wars, and reviews of the vessel have, to date, been very positive. There are, however, rivals. Spencer Brown cites the examples of both Norwegian Cruise Line and Carnival for their own innovations. \"Norwegian has this completely nuts rope course on deck 16 with a gang plank which looks down over the sea. They were also the first for alternative restaurants and led the way with outdoor spaces and great party areas with bars and restaurants outside,\" she says. \"Carnival are doing some fun design work with Carnival Vista (launching in 2016). It's like a ship within a ship with a separate family zone and a Cuban-themed area for adults. \"So Royal Caribbean are leading the way but it's nice to see it's got competition.\" There is a pressure on Royal Caribbean to raise the bar for its next creation, though Kulovaara is not concerned. \"This is about 1% great idea and 99% execution,\" he says. \"History tells us that we like to push the envelope and will continue to do that and create very unique experiences.\"","highlights":"Quantum of the Seas cost nearly $1 billion to build and is billed the world's smartest cruise ship .\nRobots make your drinks, you can take out a surfboard on deck and surf the web at speed .\nThe company behind it, Royal Caribbean, believe it is \"winning cruise wars\""}
{"article":"(CNN)The director of \"Midnight Rider\" has pleaded guilty to charges related to the 2014 death of a crew member while filming. Randall Miller pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespass Monday morning in Wayne County (Georgia) Superior Court, Deputy Clerk of Courts Betty Taylor said. The National Transportation Safety Board announced on March 24 the probable cause of the accident was trespassing by the film's crew. As part of the plea deal, Miller will spend two years behind bars and then serve eight years of probation. The deal prohibits him from directing films or being in any supervisory position in movies that would make him responsible for the safety of others for a period of 10 years. Miller, who was also ordered to pay $20,000 in fines and perform 360 hours of community service, was remanded in to custody of the sheriff to begin his sentence. A freight train hit members of the crew of the Gregg Allman biopic while they were working on a railroad bridge in February 2014. Camera assistant Sarah Elizabeth Jones, 27, was killed. The production had applied to the railroad company for permission to film on the bridge but was denied, according to the Savannah Morning News. Several other crew members were injured in the incident, CNN affiliate WTOC reported. 'Midnight Rider' pair surrender to authorities . Jones was mourned throughout  the film community. Friends set up a Facebook group, Slates for Sarah, and her death was noted in the Academy Awards' \"In Memoriam\" montage. Three additional members of the production staff faced charges related to the incident. As part of the plea agreement with Miller, charges were dropped against Jody Savin, Miller's wife and business partner, Taylor said. Miller and Savin are listed as owners of Unclaimed Fright Productions Inc., the film's production company, according to the indictment. Jay Sedrish, the film's executive producer, also received 10 years of probation. As part of his plea deal, he will be banned from supervisory positions in films for 10 years. He was also ordered to pay a fine of $10,000. A third member of the crew, first assistant director Hillary Schwartz, was found guilty after a bench trial, according to District Attorney Jackie Johnson's office. Schwartz was sentenced to 10 years of probation and ordered to pay a fine of $5,000. Like the others, he was ordered not to be involved in the safety of film crews. Schwartz had made a deal to provide testimony for the state if the case went to trial, according to the district attorney's office. Jones' parents were in court for the pleas and the trial of those involved in the death of their daughter, addressing the court before the sentencing of each, according to Johnson's office.

{"article":"Los Angeles (CNN)Conrad Hilton, the younger brother of celebrity heiress Paris Hilton, has reached a plea deal: He would admit guilt to misdemeanor assault against flight attendants in exchange for a federal felony charge being dropped, court papers says. The deal would require prosecutors to recommend probation for Hilton, who also allegedly called passengers \"peasants\" on a London-to-Los Angeles flight last summer. Hilton, 20, is scheduled to appear Thursday in federal court, but he is not expected to plead guilty at that time, said spokesman Thom Mrozek of the U.S. Attorney's Office. Hilton, who is free on $100,000 bond, was initially charged with a felony that could have carried a prison sentence up to 20 years upon a conviction. The misdemeanor charge carries up to a six-month prison sentence and a fine of at least $5,000, but federal prosecutors have agreed that they would \"recommend that defendant be sentenced to a term of probation,\" court records said. The class B misdemeanor accuses Hilton of assaulting two flight attendants aboard a British Airways flight on July 31, 2014, \"by intentionally using a display of force that reasonably caused (the attendants) to fear immediate bodily harm,\" according to court documents filed last week. Hilton signed court papers last week that state he \"repeatedly entered the bathroom to smoke marijuana and tobacco\" during Flight 269 from London to Los Angeles, court papers said. Read the plea deal . \"He also become belligerent toward some of the flight attendants,\" according to court papers signed by Hilton and his attorney. His attorney couldn't be immediately reached for comment Wednesday. At one point, Hilton told one flight attendant multiple times that \"I am going to f------ kill you,\" according to the court papers. Hilton also \"punched at, but missed\" another flight attendant, the court documents said. A more complete description of events aboard the flight was provided in initial court papers filed in early February. Those alleged Hilton threatened and intimidated flight attendants, scared parents and disengaged a bathroom smoke alarm. The court documents alleged Hilton punched the bulkhead next to an attendant's head, missing his face by about 4 inches, and told the crew, \"I could get you all fired in five minutes. I know your boss!\" \"My father will pay this out, he has done it before. Dad paid $300,000 last time,\" Hilton allegedly told a flight attendant. Hilton's father is Rick Hilton, the grandson of the Hilton Hotel empire's founder, Conrad Nicholson Hilton. Rick Hilton and his wife of more than 30 years, Kathy, are parents of four children: Paris, Nicky, Barron and Conrad. Conrad Hilton left his seat five minutes after takeoff, even though the \"fasten seat belt\" sign was still on, authorities said. Another flight attendant said Hilton rose from his seat at least 20 times during the 10\u00bd-hour flight, court documents said. Read the initial federal complaint (Warning: profane language) When Hilton became enraged because a flight attendant was following him, he shouted several times that \"I am going to f------ kill you!\" and used other vulgarities, court papers said. Passengers became frightened and disturbed, authorities said. A French family was seated behind Hilton, and the father got out of his seat and leaned \"over his kids in a protective gesture\" during one of Hilton's rants, a flight attendant told authorities, according to court papers. Hilton yelled several times, saying \"I will f------ own anyone on this flight; they are f------ peasants.\" Hilton also accused the flight attendants of \"taking the peasants' side\" and then said he was angry because he had just broken up with a girlfriend, court papers said. He bragged that he was already banned by other airlines. At some point during the flight, the attendant saw Hilton go into a bathroom and smelled cigarette smoke coming from it, authorities said. The flight's pilot, who was second-in-command to the captain, \"noticed the smoke detector above the bathroom ceiling had been stuffed with paper towels, apparently to prevent the smoke alarm from sounding,\" court papers said. The pilot later confronted Hilton, and Hilton surrendered a used pack of cigarettes and a lighter, authorities said. Hilton returned to his seat and fell asleep. The captain authorized crew members to form a \"restraint team\" to constrain Hilton before he woke up, authorities said in court papers. The crew used a blanket and handcuffs on Hilton about 75 minutes before the plane landed, authorities said. He awoke while being restrained and began screaming obscenities, court documents said. \"As Hilton was being restrained, he told the flight attendants he was a model and that they were 'going to ruin my career,' \" according to an affidavit by FBI agent David Gates filed in court in early February. Later, in an interview with the FBI the same day, Hilton said he started his travels in Mykonos, Greece, had a connection in Athens, and then traveled to London, authorities said. He took a sleeping pill before boarding the flight to Los Angeles, court papers said. Hilton admitted to calling people \"peasants\" on the flight, but he \"denied having a confrontation with a flight attendant near the start of the flight but acknowledged having other issues with flight attendants,\" the affidavit said. Hilton allegedly told the FBI agent: \"I told all of them I could get all of their jobs taken away in less than 30 seconds,\" the affidavit said.","highlights":"Conrad Hilton, younger brother of Paris Hilton, will admit to misdemeanor assault .\nPenalty for the charge is up to six months in prison, but prosecutors will recommend probation .\nHilton signs court documents stating he smoked pot on flight, \"became belligerent\""}
{"article":"This party was meant to be all about Andy Murray coming home to Scotland, but the guest of honour turned out to be the 28- year-old son of a London cabbie. Murray responded to the earsplitting support from the people who love him the most by delivering a winning start for Great Britain against America in their Davis Cup first-round knockout. But the ex-Wimbledon champion\u2019s four-set win over Donald Young turned out to be a mere warm-up act, as Glasgow's Emirates Arena screamed on James Ward as he battled John Isner to a standstill to put the home side 2-0 up with three rubbers to play. James Ward\u00a0dug out a sensational fightback\u00a0against John Isner on Friday night . Andy Murray celebrates epic victory with team-mate Ward . Ward embraces Great Britain captain Leon Smith after near five-hour thriller . An emotional Ward finally clinched his sixth match point to sensationally beat the world No 20 6-7, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6, 15-13. He is transformed when in national colours. Murray seemed close to tears as he embraced him at the end of a career-best win that makes GB firm favourites to reach the quarter finals. Ward so often saves his best for Davis Cup, to the extent that it is fairly staggering to think that he has never cracked the world\u2019s top 100. \u2018This is by far the best atmosphere I\u2019ve ever been part of in the Davis Cup,\u2019 said Ward. \u2018I\u2019d prefer not to play five sets every time but the crowd was incredible and really helped.\u2019 Against the USA in San Diego 13 months ago he put another tall man, Sam Querrey, to the sword with a comeback win to put Great Britain 2-0 up. Isner, though, is a tougher proposition altogether. American No 1 John Isner let slip a two-set lead against James Ward in Glasgow . World No 111 Ward did little wrong in the first two sets, except for blowing the five points that followed him going 4-2 up in the opening tiebreak. One thing apparent in this match was how Britain have got the court surface right in making it relatively slow and low, and he fashioned his rebound by keeping the ball skidding and attacking the American\u2019s weaker backhand side. The 111-minute deciding set became a tug of war in which neither man would yield. Isner is, after all, the player who once won an 11 hour five minute match over Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon. Ward forced two match points at 5-4, one at 10-9 and one at 11-10, then needed to save two break points at 11-11 before breaking to love to clinch the match. GB captain Leon Smith said: \u2018It\u2019s really tough for the USA now but they have Jim Courier as captain and he will not let them go down without a fight.\u2019 Andy Murray and Jamie Murray roared on James Ward to victory in five-set thriller . The question now is whether Murray will put himself on the line in today\u2019s doubles with brother Jamie for what would be a highly charged encounter with the world champion Bryan brothers. After Ward\u2019s win he is surely much more likely to make way for Dom Inglot and save himself for tomorrow. Murray completed the first leg of his task when he took down USA No 2 Donald Young 6-1, 6-1, 4-6, 6-2 in just under two hours. Apart from an untimely dip at the end of the third set, Murray was in imperious form against world No 47 Young. By the time he had finished the warm-up the crowd had joined in a rousing singalong to Runrig\u2019s Loch Lomond, and for Murray it was the perfect preparation. He said. \u2018I used that energy and emotion very well at the beginning of the match.

{"article":"(CNN)Another one for the \"tourists behaving badly\" file. Two American women have reportedly been arrested for carving their initials into a wall with a coin inside Rome's Colosseum. Daily Italian newspaper La Stampa says the women, aged 21 and 25, were spotted carrying out the act by fellow tourists, who then told security. The two letters -- J and N -- were about eight inches in length and scratched on a brick wall at the historic Roman amphitheater. The women, both from California, reportedly snapped a selfie of themselves with their initials before they were arrested. Their names have not been released. The American pair may now face a fine for \"aggravated damage\" on a building of historical and artistic interest. If one Russian's experience is anything to go by, the price won't be cheap. Last November, authorities in Rome slapped a 20,000-euro ($21,685) penalty on a Russian tourist caught carving his name into the famed landmark. The 42-year-old man was apprehended after a guard at the Colosseum saw him carve the letter \"K\" in a section of brickwork. After police caught up with him, the man was found guilty of causing aggravated damage, fined and given a four-month suspended sentence. The Russian was one of five tourists caught carving graffiti on Colosseum walls in 2014. The earlier incidents involved two Australians -- a father and son -- and a Canadian and a Brazilian, both teenagers. Rome isn't alone in having to deal with inappropriate tourist behavior this month. Egypt is now looking into reports that one of its most historic sites was the backdrop for a Russian porn flick. According to Al Arabiya News, authorities have confirmed that an X-rated film was shot next to the Pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx and are now investigating. The video was reportedly made by Russian tourists, who then uploaded it to the Internet nine months ago. Al Arabiya reports that Minister of Antiquities Mamdouh al-Demati says the issue has been referred to the public prosecutor and new surveillance cameras are being installed in the area. The incident comes as a reminder that no world landmark is safe from the salacious urges of tourists -- no matter how sacred it might be to the locals. Cambodia's Angkor Archeological Park experienced its own string of nudity-related incidents this year. In February, U.S. tourists and sisters Lindsey Kate Adams and Leslie Jan Adams were deported after allegedly getting caught taking partially nude photos at Preah Khan temple, one of the sacred sites inside Cambodia's Angkor complex. They received six-month suspended prison sentences, a one-million riel ($250) fine and were banned from entering the country for four years. In January, a group of photos featuring a topless dancer leaning against the ruins surfaced on Facebook. Early last year, Peru officials were forced to respond to a chain of \"naked tourism\" incidents at Machu Picchu, also a World Heritage Site. They detained four American tourists, two Canadians and two Australians for stripping down for pictures at the site. CNN's Barry Neild contributed to this report.","highlights":"Two American women arrested for carving initials into a Colosseum wall .\nMeanwhile, Egypt investigating Russian pornography film reportedly shot at Great Pyramids .\nCambodia's Angkor Archeological Park experienced a string of nudity-related incidents this year ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Comic books of the past few years have seen a lot of changes (a female Thor, anyone?) but not quite so many at one time. Three major characters -- Superman, Wonder Woman (both of DC Comics, a Time Warner company, like CNN) and Archie Andrews -- came out with new looks (and costumes in two cases) Thursday. Superman and Wonder Woman are no stranger to change over time, but these are pretty different from what we're used to. Wonder Woman is back to wearing pants (similar to her style circa 2010, not to mention a brief time in the 1970s) along with something of a turtleneck and body armor. Superman looks the most casual that we've ever seen him, simply in a t-shirt and jeans, and decidedly shorter hair. He also looks like someone you might not want to come across in a dark alley. As for Archie (who never really died, by the way), he's getting ready for his promised TV show by debuting a modern look -- one that makes it much easier to see why Betty and Veronica have been fighting for his affections all of these years. It's been a whirlwind time for comic book fans, and there will be a lot to get used to.","highlights":"Superman, Wonder Woman and Archie all debuted new looks Thursday .\nThree of the most well-known comic book characters of all time look radically different ."}

{"article":"(CNN)A British military health care worker in Sierra Leone has tested positive for Ebola, a UK health agency said. Medical experts are assessing what to do next, including whether or not the evacuate the infected individual to the United Kingdom for treatment, according to a Public Health England spokesperson. An Ebola outbreak has devastated parts of West Africa, with Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia being the hardest hit nations. The vast majority of the more than 24,000 confirmed, reportable and suspected cases, as well as the nearly 10,000 reported deaths, have been in those three countries, the World Health Organization reports. In some cases, citizens of other nations have come down with the deadly disease while working there -- as, apparently, is true for the UK military heath care worker whose diagnosis was announced Wednesday. Authorities are investigating how this person was exposed to the virus and tracing individuals in recent contact with the diagnosed worker, said the Public Health England spokesperson. \"Any individuals identified as having had close contact will be assessed and a clinical decision made regarding bringing them to the UK,\" the spokesperson said. Pauline Cafferkey, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United Kingdom, was discharged from London's Royal Free Hospital in January after battling the virus. She is a public health nurse in Scotland's South Lanarkshire area who was part of a 30-strong team of medical volunteers deployed to West Africa by the UK government last month in a joint endeavor with Save the Children, according to British media outlets.","highlights":"Spokesperson: Experts are investigating how the UK military health care worker got Ebola .\nIt is being decided if the military worker infected in Sierra Leone will return to England .\nThere have been some 24,000 reported cases and 10,000 deaths in the latest Ebola outbreak ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Boko Haram, the Nigeria-based Islamist terror group, has pledged allegiance to ISIS, according to an audio message purported to be from Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau. In the audio, which was posted online Saturday, the speaker says Boko Haram is announcing its \"allegiance to the Caliph of the Muslims, Ibrahim ibn Awad ibn Ibrahim al-Husseini al-Qurashi,\" which is another name for ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. CNN has not been able to independently authenticate the message. But Jacob Zenn, an expert on the terror group and is with the Jamestown Foundation, said the recording appeared to be authentic. He said that while other messages have been faked, the speaker in this one is Shekau. \"Boko Haram joining the ISIS fold makes sense to both groups,\" he said from Abuja, Nigeria. \"Boko Haram will get legitimacy, which will help its recruiting, funding and logistics as it expands into (French-speaking) West Africa. It will also get guidance from ISIS in media warfare and propaganda. Previously Boko Haram was a sort of outcast in the global Jihadi community. Now it is perhaps ISIS's biggest affiliate. \"ISIS gets more international legitimacy as a global caliphate.\" Zenn said the allegiance will be official when an ISIS leader such as spokesman Abu Mohammed al Adnani issues a statement. Boko Haram has had two main factions -- one led by Shekau and the other comprising former members of  Ansaru, a Boko Haram offshoot. Ansaru had been operating from around 2012 as the Nigerian wing of AQIM (al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb). After the French-led intervention in Mali in 2013, a significant number of Ansaru members re-integrated with Shekau, Zenn told CNN. The prerequisite for Boko Haram joining ISIS coalition was a coming together of two factions. ISIS connected with former Ansaru fighters within Boko Haram and pressed them to further unify the group's ranks. The result was the formation of a unity general command between the two factions. That involved bridging of some ideological differences between the al Qaeda-like Ansaru and the ultra extreme \"takfiri\"-like Shekau. The pledge follows a period during which Shekau's faction had been mimicking ISIS, including praising al-Baghdadi and featuring his image in their videos and photos. Zenn said that until recently there had been little feedback from ISIS, apart from a few references to Nigerian jihadis in recent issues of the English-language Dabiq magazine. It appears that a month ago ISIS set up a Twitter account on which Saturday's message was linked, Zenn said. The Twitter handle was mutually promoted by Boko Haram and ISIS. In July, Shekau voiced support for ISIS, and declared a overtaken town in northeast Nigeria to be part of an Islamic caliphate. But he also said he was praying for al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and Taliban leader Mullah Omar. U.S. intelligence officials have some doubts the two groups would get along. The CIA's analysis has been that Boko Haram is very African and rooted in that region's Islamic practices, even if they have similar fundamentalist interpretations of Islam.  And ISIS's Arab leadership and membership tends to have racist attitudes toward blacks, not unlike the society they come from. ISIS leaders view Shekau as inferior, partly for racist reasons, the CIA indicated at a briefing for reporters. Boko Haram, whose name translates as \"Western education is sin,\" has been waging a yearslong campaign of terror aimed at instituting its extreme version of Sharia law. Boko Haram's tactics have intensified in recent years, from battling Nigerian government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages, mass kidnappings, assassinations, market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques. Much of this violence has taken place in Nigeria. But neighboring countries, such as Cameroon and Chad, have also been hit increasingly hard. CNN's Steve Almasy and Evan Perez contributed to this story.","highlights":"Audio message was released online Saturday and speaker is said to be Boko Haram leader .\nExpert says partnership will have benefits for both groups, including giving ISIS international legitimacy .\nBut U.S. intelligence officials have indicated their doubts they groups would work well as partners ."}

{"article":"(CNN)It is now generally accepted that Germanwings first officer Andreas Lubitz did indeed lock his captain out of the cockpit, put their airplane into a steep descent, and then sit back and wait calmly for the end to arrive. He did it with premeditation, having discarded a doctor's note that would have excused him from work that day. He  joins the short and infamous list of airline pilots, a handful over the past two decades, who have used their airplanes to combine suicide with mass murder. Why is this thought at once so fascinating and so horrifying? It is because of the incompatibility between what we want to believe about flying and what we now see. Air travel presents itself as a highly controlled, stringently professional activity, stripped of every unpredictable element. Flight crews wear military-style uniforms not because they could not fly equally well in street clothes, but because uniforms convey to passengers a subliminal suggestion that they are of a different breed, as far from ordinary folk as a world-class athlete is from a duffer. Not only are pilots smarter and better-trained than ordinary people, those stripes and caps say, but they also must be less forgetful than we, less distractible, better rested, not prone to irritability or sadness or smoldering resentments. Like soldiers, they must be just a little bit robotic, efficient, brave and purified of the trash that infests the souls of common humans. Because they have earned their stripes, we feel safe -- even when it seems impossible for us to understand, or apparently for anyone to explain, what keeps those huge metal contraptions up in the air. The truth, as the voluminous history of airplane accidents reveals, is that pilots are not different from other people. They can be careless, lazy, inattentive and reckless. They can drink too much. When pilots talk among themselves,  the mistakes, the close calls, the disasters averted by sheer luck are favorite topics. But if pilots slip up in little ways from time to time, the sweeping drama of aviation, in which they are the actors and we the audience, eclipses their faults. Besides, most flying is routine -- hours of boredom, the clich\u00e9 goes, punctuated by moments of sheer terror. The glitches have long since been ironed out, and the airplanes are so wonderfully engineered that they usually protect even the worst pilot from himself. Nor are pilots of a higher moral type than the rest of us. Despite the pieties they occasionally utter, pilots do not consciously shoulder the burden of hundreds of lives or feel more responsible for a full airplane than for an empty one. Pilots, by and large, are proud. They identify with the airplane; it is an extension and enlargement of the self, and the pilot feels the same motive to deliver it safely to its destination as you feel when driving a car on a crowded freeway. A pilot values a smooth landing because it demonstrates skill, not because the people in back are still alive. The greatest guarantee you have that your pilot is devoted to your safety is the fact that he or she is in the airplane with you. So we should not be overly astonished if from time to time a pilot does something completely incompatible with our confidence. Pilots are drawn from the diverse pool of human types. The human mind is the blackest of boxes; no one, neither colleague nor psychologist, can reliably peer inside it. Desperate, cataclysmic acts occur almost daily all over the world; why should they not occur, once in a long while, in cockpits? Perhaps, with time, we will understand better who Andreas Lubitz was and what he did. Today, we still know very little.","highlights":"Experts suspect first officer Andreas Lubitz locked pilot out of the cockpit of plane .\nPeter Garrison: Pilots don't exist on different moral plane than the rest of us, and the human mind is the blackest of boxes ."}
{"article":"Kevin Pietersen is confident he can score more Test hundreds for England, if he is given the opportunity. The controversial, record-breaking batsman trails only captain Alastair Cook in the all-time list of England's most prolific Test centurions - having made 23, before he was sacked 13 months ago. The 34-year-old is hoping to resurrect his career with his adopted country after new England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves hinted that a return to county cricket - and first-class form - may put him back in the reckoning after all. Kevin Pietersen believes he is capable of adding to his 23 Test centuries if he receives an England recall . England captain Alastair Cook (right) has scored two more centuries than Pietersen (centre) Alastair Cook - 25 . Kevin Pietersen - 23 . Wally Hammond - 22 . MC Cowdrey - 22 . Geoffrey Boycott - 22 . Pietersen is therefore pursuing the possibility of securing a new contract in this country. Surrey, who de-registered him six months ago after a summer in which he played only Twenty20 cricket, appear to be strong favourites to re-sign him - as long as he can secure a release from his arrangement to play in the Indian Premier League, which clashes with the start of the English domestic season. Pietersen was axed after England's 2013-14 Ashes whitewash defeat, and ECB managing director Paul Downton subsequently described his 'disengagement' with his team-mates. He struggled for form, and fitness, in the summer that followed but rediscovered both for Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash this winter. On his return to Australia, to commentate on the knockout stages of the World Cup, he made it clear in an interview on Fox Sports on Tuesday that he believes he can excel again for England. 'I don't think my best days are behind me. 'I thought I batted as well as I've ever batted in my career in Australia a few months ago. 'I think that's nonsense - I reckon I've still got quite a few Test hundreds in me.' Former England cricketer Pietersen has rubbished claims suggesting his best days are behind him . England appeared to have severed all ties with the South Africa-born batsman, until Graves recently indicated otherwise. Pietersen's autobiography, in which he depicted a culture of bullying in the England dressing-room and was highly critical of former team-mates and management staff, seemed to merely confirm a permanent split. Former England batting coach Graham Gooch, for one, is still warning against his return. 'I wouldn't bring Pietersen back,' he told the Evening Standard. 'I would question whether he would have made that much of a difference in the World Cup. 'His record for England over his career has been box office. But his performances in ODI cricket before this tournament weren't special. Former England batting coach Graham Gooch insists Pietersen does not deserve an international recall . 'Kevin Pietersen did some great things for England, make no mistake. But now it's time to move on.' Gooch, on staff during England's Ashes defeat down under, takes particular issue with some of the content of Pietersen's autobiography - published last October. 'I vehemently disagree with all the things Kevin Pietersen said. 'That's not the dressing-room I remember. 'In November 2013, he was given a memento by the players for his 100th Test in the dressing-room before the first Test at Brisbane. 'Then he stated 'This is the best England environment I have ever played in'. 'Those words came out of his mouth.

She would be fined, and still she was like 'ooh, I don't care, I want a white man, ooh,' \" he once told an audience at London's Soho Theater during his standup show \"The Racist.\" \"And my dad was also like, well, you know how the Swiss love chocolate.\" Why mixed-race comic was 'born a crime' Race, identity and ethnicity have figured in prominently in his act. Because of his parents' then-illegal relationship, he joked, \"In the streets, my father couldn't walk with us. He would walk on the other side of the road and wave at me like a creepy pedophile. And my mom could walk with me, but every time the police went by, she would drop me. I felt like a bag of weed.\" Noah has said in his act that he lost touch with his father for several years because of apartheid. In 2012, he told NPR that he was fascinated by how Americans discuss race. \"I got to Baltimore, and I was expecting ... because urban means built up and new, you know,\" he said. \"So I got there, and I was, 'Whoa, it's not as urban as people told me.' ... But it's very black. I'll tell you that much.\" Noah told CNN's \"African Voices\" in 2013 that after finding success in his homeland -- where he starred on a soap opera, hosted his own radio show and was the subject of the  2012 documentary \"You Laugh But It's True\" -- he moved to the United States for a year to try to raise his profile. He returned to his country with new material shaped by his time spent in the States, he said. \"Comedy is really getting quite popular in South Africa,\" Noah said. \"It's moving from the bastard child of entertainment into the mainstream, which is very good. I think the reason it's doing so well is because South Africans need to laugh and South Africans want to laugh.\" Noah has moved to the U.S. permanently and told Newsweek, \"I've always wanted to be a comedian in the world. I don't want to be labeled a South African comedian.\" On \"The Daily Show,\" he debuted as a correspondent with a bit titled \"Spot the Africa,\" which juxtaposed modern-day South Africa and the United States. What remains to be seen is whether what the Guardian has described as \"his combination of terribly polite, butter-wouldn't-melt stage presence and biting, often brutal gags\" will translate into success on \"The Daily Show.\"","highlights":"Noah is the son of a black South African woman and a white Swiss man .\nHe's very popular in South Africa .\nNoah's act often focuses on race and ethnicity ."}

{"article":"Roy Hodgson is confident in Harry Kane's ability to shine for England, it is just a case of whether there is space for him in the upcoming squad. This has been quite the season for the 21-year-old, whose 24 goals in all competitions is far and away the best tally from any English striker this term. That form has impressed Three Lions boss Hodgson, who has strongly hinted recently that Kane will earn a first senior call-up in two weeks' time. England manager Roy Hodgson is open to the possibility of calling up Tottenham striker Harry Kane . The Spurs front man has is a regular in the England Under 21 set up and has been in great form for his club . Kane was far from his best in the Capital One Cup final but Hodgson said he thinks the striker is 'ready' It is not just the Spurs man vying for a striking berth, though, with a number of other in-form, uncapped players hoping to be involved against Lithuania and Italy. Saido Berahino, Danny Ings and Charlie Austin have all impressed for their clubs this season - but it is Kane who is the main talking point. 'He's in my thoughts of course, he deserves to be,' Hodgson said, speaking at the London Football Awards, which raises funds for national charity, Willow. 'He's scoring goals for one of our top teams in the Premier League but I know him anyway, he's done a lot of good work for the Under-21s. Burnley striker Danny Ings (right) is among the names for a call up to the Three Lions first team . QPR's Charlie Austin (left) and West Brom's Saido Berahino (right) have both been in fine scoring form . 'What pleases me most is young players are getting their chance to play. In the past 19, 20, 21-year-olds would be loaned out or would have to sit back and wait for their chance. Now more and more of them are taking the chance when they get it. 'I'm delighted for him and we'll see when I select my squad at the end of month if he's in it.' Asked whether Kane was ready to make the step up to the senior side, Hodgson said: 'He's ready. If he wasn't ready he wouldn't be playing for Tottenham and scoring lots of goals. 'The question you ask is has the player got the quality and talent we're looking for and is there a space for him? 'If he comes in then someone's going to drop out and most forwards we've got have done quite well in the autumn. 'But I can't include everyone unfortunately. It's not always a question of are they good enough, it's a question of is there space at this time.' However Kane is the one gaining all the attention having scored 24 goals in all competitions this season . Wayne Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck look set to be involved in the squad, while Rickie Lambert and Jermain Defoe are other experienced forward options when the national team reconvene after a four-month break. 'I am looking forward to it, we all are,' Hodgson said. 'Certainly I and my coaching staff are. I hope the players are looking forward to it, too. 'It will be nice to see them again. We did plan a little meeting in January but we found another way of staying in touch with them. 'It will be nice to see them physically again and I hope to see them in as good a shape as I thought they were last autumn.' Hodgson was speaking at the London Football Awards, which raises vital funds for Willow - the only national charity working with seriously ill young adults aged 16 to 40 to fulfil uplifting and unforgettable special days.

{"article":"(CNN)New York City public schools will now observe two Muslim holidays, officials announced Wednesday, making the district -- the nation's biggest -- one of the few to put Islamic holy days on its calendar. Under the change announced by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and city Schools Chancellor Carmen Farina, there will be no class for Eid al-Adha, also known as the Festival of Sacrifice, starting next September 24. Another Muslim holiday, Eid al-Fitr -- a festival marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan -- will become a holiday for those in summer school starting in 2016. \"This is a common-sense change,\" de Blasio said Wednesday, \"and one that recognizes our growing Muslim community and honors its contributions to our city.\" The decision affects some 1 million students in New York City. While it's not known exactly how many of them are Muslim, City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito said that almost 1 million of the more than 8 million people in the city's five boroughs practice Islam and a 2009 Columbia University study found that roughly 10% of New York City public school students are Muslim. The move isn't a surprise, given de Blasio's campaign pledge to alter the school calendar with Muslim families in mind. \"Muslim students and their families who observe Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha shouldn't have to choose between an instructional day and their religious obligations,\" said Farina. \"This new addition will also enable a teachable moment in the classroom for our students to learn about religious tolerance and the societal contributions of various cultures.\" Linda Sarsour, executive director of the Arab American Association of New York and the parent of three public school students, said a plan in which students wouldn't have to choose between education and faith \"a win for our children and for future generations in this country.\" \"Muslims are a part of the fabric of this country,\" she said. \"We make our country proud, and today, New York City made us proud.\" New York City joins school districts in other states, including New Jersey, Massachusetts and Vermont, that similarly observe Muslim holidays, according to a news release from Farina's office. And Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha join other religious holidays already on New York's public school calendar. In addition to holidays like Easter that always fall on a weekend, students already have Christian holidays such as Good Friday and Christmas off, as well as the Jewish holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. CNN's Lorenzo Ferigno and Rob Frehse contributed to this report.","highlights":"School chief: Muslim families shouldn't have to weigh school vs. religious observances .\nBill de Blasio had pledged to change the school calendar during his mayoral campaign .\nNew York City's public schools already observe Jewish and Christian holidays ."}
{"article":"(CNN)On the 6th of April 1996, San Jose Clash and DC United strode out in front of 31,683 expectant fans at the Spartan Stadium in San Jose, California. The historic occasion was the first ever Major League Soccer match -- a brave new dawn for the world's favorite sport in a land its charms had yet to conquer. Summarizing the action for ESPN, commentator Ty Keough eagerly described the momentous \"birth of a new era for American soccer.\" Looking back at footage from that balmy evening now it's hard not to feel a certain nostalgia. Baggy shirts, questionable hairstyles and strange rule adaptations to make games more exciting were all part of the formative MLS experience. Countdown clocks were employed to provide drama at the end of each half. Even more bizarrely, tied games were settled by shootouts that saw attacking players run with the ball from 35-yards out before attempting to beat the opposing goalkeeper. As the MLS prepares to mark the beginning of its 20th season, it's hard to comprehend just how much the league has progressed in the intervening period. Long gone is the desire to tamper with the rules of the game for a start. Attendances are higher than ever before while the number of teams involved has doubled from 10 in the 1996 campaign to 20 in 2015. A further four are set to be added by 2020. On top of this, the new season is the first of a new domestic TV and media rights deal with FOX, ESPN and Univision worth $700 million over eight years. This figure may pale beside the $5.1 billion recently paid by UK broadcasters for the English Premier League, the richest football league in the world, but it represents a tripling in value of the previous MLS deal. According to Phil Rawlins, co-primary owner and president of the new MLS franchise, Orlando City Soccer Club, \"the industry and the game itself has moved on dramatically\" in the U.S.. He believes what would equal 50 years growth in most other industries has been experienced in the first two decades of the MLS. Rawlins' club is a prime example of this rapid transformation. He describes players being pushed out of changing facilities because of a schedule clash with a yoga class not so long ago. This weekend 60,000 fans are expected to witness Orlando City's opening weekend fixture against New York City, another new club making their MLS bow. World Cup winners Kaka and David Villa will turn out for Orlando and New York City respectively. \"We're just on the crest of the wave at the moment,\" Rawlins said of football's American progress. \"Can it be the number two, number three sport in this country? Yes, I think it can. And it can be in a short space of time.\" These positive assertions are backed by the huge interest U.S. fans showed in last year's World Cup in Brazil. Team USA's group stage clash with Portugal attracted 25 million viewers, according to figures from TV ratings firm, Nielsen. That's considerably more than the 15 million baseball's 2013 World Series averaged on FOX or the similar audience that tuned into the 2014 NBA finals on ABC. Anyone who saw 20,000 pumped-up young fans pack out Chicago's Grant Park to cheer on their country via big screens, meanwhile, would find it hard to argue against soccer in the U.S. now being anything other than a big deal. Reaching this promising stage, however, has been anything but a smooth ride. The MLS was reported to have lost as much as $250 million in its first five years while average attendances initially dwindled after the inaugural season. Three teams -- Miami Fusion, Tampa Bay Mutiny (both in 2001) and Chivas USA (2014) -- were disbanded along the way due to a mixture of lack of fan interest and ownership troubles. A report by Forbes at the end of 2013, meanwhile, claimed that only 10 out of 19 MLS teams were profitable. And as recently as this week, MLS players looked like they could be going on strike over wages and the right of players to become free agents when their contracts end. Then there's the way the league develops, attracts and trades players. A salary cap restricts the amount teams can spend on playing squads. Each side, however, has a number of spaces that can be allocated to \"off budget\" signings which are not included within the cap. This includes promising Generation Adidas players who enter the MLS through the draft systems before completing their college education. Homegrown players from club's development academies are also exempt as are a maximum of three designated players (DPs), usually stellar international names whose wages and transfer fees will be covered by club owners or sponsors. One of the main criticisms of the MLS and its complex player acquisition rulebook is that while it does entice prominent stars of the game like David Beckham, Freddie Ljungberg and Thierry Henry to appear in the MLS, it only does so when their careers are on a downward trajectory. Why would an exceptional player want to move to a league that can only attract a handful of top talents at any one time, after all? And herein lies one of the leagues biggest challenges in attracting and keeping the talented players fans want to see. Although the likes of the salary cap encourages fiscal probity, it means MLS teams are restricted by rules clubs in other markets are not. Head coach of Sporting Kansas, Peter Vermes, highlighted these difficulties in comments carried by the Kansas City Star newspaper last year. \"We're in a place where at times you can't compete with foreign clubs because of the kind of dynamics they have in regards to finances. We have a salary cap. They don't,\" Vermes said. According to Paulo Teixeira, a football agent who has worked to bring in and sell players from the league in recent years, current philosophies with regards player-trading may be have to be tweaked to help the MLS grow yet further. He describes the importance of placing an emphasis on attracting younger players with European passports. Such talented individuals will have a sell-on value that can be recouped by the league and their clubs if they move on from the MLS to the biggest and wealthiest leagues across the Atlantic. Theoretically, at least, this money can then be reinvested in the league, player development and attracting yet more promising players to the MLS. This in turn will raise the standard further. An early example of this strategy can perhaps be found in the transfer of Oriol Rossell, a Spanish midfielder who moved from Sporting Kansas to Sporting Lisbon last year in a deal brokered by Teixeira. Rossell arrived on a free transfer aged 20 after being released by FC Barcelona in 2012. He excelled at Kansas, winning the MLS Cup before being sold to the Portuguese giants at a profit in June 2014. Teixeira is quick to make clear such plans would need good scouting systems to truly flourish. It could also be achieved by signing DPs closer to the peak stage of their career, he added. This last point is something that appears be happening already. \"Before they used to have a lot of big names who could no longer run in Europe,\" Teixeira said. \"(But) Villa is not an old guy, (Frank) Lampard is still going strong\" and both could still offer something to teams in Europe, he said by way of example of New York City's first DP signings. Nevertheless, he continued, the signing of more young players with big potential  \"is probably something we'll see more of.\" Whether Teixeira is correct will become apparent in the months and years ahead. Either way, that brave new MLS dawn that broke over San Jose back in 1996 has turned into a bright morning. CNN's Don Riddell contributed to this story.","highlights":"The 20th MLS season begins this weekend .\nLeague has changed dramatically since its inception in 1996 .\nSome question whether rules regarding salary caps and transfers need to change ."}

{"article":"Jerusalem (CNN)Within 48 hours of his election night victory, Benjamin Netanyahu rolled back his pre-election comments that there would be no Palestinian state if he were Prime Minister, but the damage may already have been done to relations with the two other major players in the negotiations: the United States and the Palestinians. In an interview with NBC, Netanyahu said, \"I haven't changed my policy, I never retracted my speech six years ago calling for a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes the Jewish state. What has changed is the reality, Abu Mazen (nickhame of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas) the Palestinian leader refuses to recognize the Jewish state, and he's made a pact with Hamas that calls for the destruction of Israel. And every territory vacated these days in the Middle East is taken up by Islamist forces and we want that to change so we can realize the vision of real sustained peace. I don't want a one-state solution, I want a sustainable two-state solution.\" Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat says he believes the pre-election statement that Netanyahu will not allow a two-state solution. He says the Palestinians will keep pursuing statehood through the international arena instead of through negotiations. \"I've negotiated with them for 20 years, and I complained to the international community that there is a big difference between someone being a tough negotiator which is legitimate and someone being a non-negotiator,\" Erekat said. \"All Netanyahu needs to do to gain the credibility and the trust, not only of me but of the international community, he needs to stand tall and tell the Israeli people that in order to live in peace with our neighbors we're going to have to recognize the state of Palestine.\" Erekat says the Palestinians may try again for recognition once more at the United Nations, a forum where they fell one vote short of recognition as a full UN member state in December. A new United Nations Security Council consisting of different member states may be more favorable to a second Palestinian bid. So where does that leave the United States? The White House said it would \"reassess\" the relationship between the United States and Israel. The broad relationship includes security cooperation, financial assistance, and strong diplomatic ties. Both leaders reaffirmed the strength of those ties in the weeks before the Israeli elections. But the United States has also used its veto power as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council to block resolutions unfavorable to Israel. Some of that protection could be at stake here as the White House urges both sides back to negotiations. The last peace talks, moderated by Secretary of State John Kerry, broke down in April 2014 after nine months of negotiations. As the talks deteriorated before the scheduled deadline, Israel withdrew from the negotiations when Fatah announced a reconciliation with Hamas, a militant Islamic group, and an intention to form a unity government. In a phone call with Netanyahu, President Barack Obama congratulated Netanyahu and stressed the importance of a two-state solution. But with so much skepticism on both sides, a lasting peace remains a distant goal.","highlights":"The White House says it would \"reassess\" the relationship between the United States and Israel .\nThat comes after Netanyahu made campaign statements against a Palestinian state .\nNetanyahu rolled back the comments after his election victory ."}
{"article":"(CNN)\"The Stomp\" remains one of the most controversial plays in NCAA history -- when Duke's Christian Laettner lifted his foot and stepped on Kentucky's Aminu Timberlake during a critical moment of what has been called the greatest college basketball game ever played, the 1992 NCAA East Regional Final. Mention The Stomp in a diner or bar in Kentucky and you best be prepared for a string of expletives -- from the blue-haired elders to the wealthiest thoroughbred trainers -- about how Laettner is the vilest human on Earth. Then, the woulda, coulda, shouldas begin: Laettner should've been kicked out; he should never have been in the game to hit that miraculous shot; Kentucky should've advanced to the Final Four. The Stomp returned to headlines this week after ESPN aired a \"30 for 30\" documentary called \"I Hate Christian Laettner,\" detailing the life of one of the best players to ever play college ball and why he remains a lightning rod to this day. When it comes to The Stomp, Laettner says he decided to give a \"little payback\" while Timberlake lay helpless on the ground. If Kentucky fans needed more reason to hate Laettner, those words might've been it. But on Twitter, Laettner issued a video apology to Timberlake, the first time he'd ever done so: . Timberlake could've lashed back, but he's too classy for that. He is one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet. He remains active in basketball, coaching an eighth-grade girls travel-team in Atlanta. (In full transparency, I coached with him last year.) He responded to Laettner, saying he appreciates and accepts the apology. But he makes it clear where his loyalty lies. At the end of his 23-second message, Timberlake's voice turns into a smooth baritone and he ends with: \"Go Big Blue.\" Timberlake doesn't dwell on The Stomp. The thing he prefers to remember from that game was the honor of playing in it -- and the locker room speech by Coach Rick Pitino after the game. Pitino held up an old Sports Illustrated cover that said the Kentucky program was in shambles. Pitino told his players that although they lost on the court, his players had done something much bigger: They'd put Kentucky basketball back on the map. \"It put a lot of things in perspective, especially for a young team in a program that had just returned from heavy NCAA sanctions,\" Timberlake says. \"All I remember is working with our heads down, attacking every practice and every game to the best of our ability. And that speech just reminded us of what was accomplished through that hard work, even in a loss.\" That is a message, he says, that still resonates in his life: \"Sometimes you don't see the full picture and don't reap the immediate rewards of your work, but 9 times out of 10 good things do happen.\" Timberlake has had fun with The Stomp over the years, even donning a \"I Still Hate Laettner\" T-shirt that was given to him and posing with fans when Kentucky and Duke played a couple years ago. He jokes that he's not sure if he was \"a true hater\" of Laettner like so many others. But that game will never quite sit well with Kentucky players and fans. However, Timberlake says the documentary gave him a new perspective on Laettner that he thought he'd never have. \"I can really respect his accomplishments, his basketball career and his passion for the game,\" Timberlake says. Don't get him wrong. Timberlake still bleeds Kentucky blue. He'd love to see Kentucky play Duke for the title this year, this time with the Wildcats walking away as the winners.

{"article":"(CNN)Sorry, Spotify, but it appears Taylor Swift has found someone else to fill that \"Blank Space.\" Billboard reports that most of Swift's albums are streaming on TIDAL, the music service recently purchased by Jay Z via his S. Carter Enterprises. In November, Swift refused to allow from Spotify to stream her new album \"1989\" and pulled the rest of her catalog from the site.

Taylor Swift pulls her music from Spotify . Music sales have declined sharply in the past few years, and in July, Swift wrote an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal about the future of the music industry in which she touched on the issue. Customers \"are buying only the (albums) that hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really aren't alone in feeling so alone,\" she wrote. \"It isn't as easy today as it was 20 years ago to have a multiplatinum-selling album, and as artists, that should challenge and motivate us.\" Spotify CEO Daniel Ek responded in a blog post to the singer\/songwriter's decision to deny her music to his 40 million-plus customers. His company was not the enemy, he said. \"Spotify has paid more than two billion dollars to labels, publishers and collecting societies for distribution to songwriters and recording artists,\" Ek wrote. \"When I hear stories about artists and songwriters who say they've seen little or no money from streaming and are naturally angry and frustrated, I'm really frustrated too. The music industry is changing -- and we're proud of our part in that change -- but lots of problems that have plagued the industry since its inception continue to exist.\" In January, Jay Z's company bid more than $56 million for TIDAL, which is billing itself as \"the first music streaming service that combines the best High Fidelity sound quality, High Definition music videos and expertly Curated Editorial.\" It's available in the U.S. and UK for $19.99 a month. According to Billboard, Swift's \"1989\" album, which was the biggest seller of 2014, is not currently on TIDAL.

{"article":"It all started as an innocent attempt to find clams, but left a small fox in a tense standoff with a 500lb brown bear. As the two animals faced one another on the tidal flats of the Katmai National Park in southern Alaska, it seemed there would only be one inevitable ending. But miraculously after running round in circles chased by the bear, the red fox was left to return to its search in peace as it appeared the Alaskan brown bear just wanted someone to play with. A red fox appeared to be facing an inevitable ending when it was locked in a stand off with an approaching bear . But it appeared the grizzly brown bear just wanted a playmate, and the fox and bear played a game of chase . American photographer Nate Zeman was photographing the fox when he saw the large bear approach from nearby woods and head straight for the animal - a fraction of its size. The 32-year-old, of Breckenridge, Colorado, said: 'The bear appeared from the forest, located about a mile away, and began to make a beeline straight towards us. 'The bear walked straight past me at a very close distance and kept going towards the fox, and began to chase it. 'The fox, however, easily outmanoeuvred the bear as it was chased in circles a couple of times, and when they stopped they both squared off about thirty feet apart.' The agile fox managed to dodge the bear and neither animal seemed aggressive, not running at full speed . And despite the tense stand-off it soon became clear that the bear just wanted to play. The pair were seen running in circles, neither at full speed, with the agile fox deftly managing to stay out of harm's way. 'Most likely the bear just wanted to chase the fox, and it's as simple as that,' added Mr Zeman. 'It wasn't aggressive enough in its behaviour to be meaning to actually kill, it just really seemed to want a chase! The fox had been calmly searching for clams on the\u00a0tidal flats of the Katmai National Park in Alaska . But the red fox's relative calm was soon disrupted when a grizzly brown bear made a direct beeline for it . The 500lb bear was seen to approach from a nearby forest and head straight for the fox that was clamming . Both animals faced eachother, and at first it appeared there would only be one outcome for the small fox . 'Soon after I took the photographs the fox walked off in the other direction and continued clamming, the bear lay there for a few moments before slowly getting up and sauntering away.' The Alaskan brown bear is the name of any member of the grizzly bear family that lives in the coastal regions of southern Alaska. They are the second largest type of brown bear in the world, only after the giant bears of Kodiak Island. As the bear approached the fox began running and the game of chase between the pair began .

{"article":"(CNN)I met Kelly Gissendaner in January 2010 in a nondescript classroom at Metro State Prison for Women in Atlanta. She arrived for class beaming with excitement about the journey she was about to begin -- participation in a yearlong academic theology program sponsored jointly by four Atlanta seminaries. Since she has been sentenced to the death penalty and lives in solitary confinement, Kelly was particularly eager to share community with others, if only one morning a week. And she was grateful for the opportunity to explore the Bible and theology in a rigorous manner that would nurture and deepen her devotional life. That image of her on the first day of class remains vivid to me because it captures the core of who Kelly is \u2014 who she has become: someone full of contagious joy and gratitude, open to others and to new experiences for growth and ministry. Kelly's process of transformation began shortly after she arrived in prison following her conviction for murder in the death of her husband, Doug Gissendaner. A pastor began visiting her and initiated a series of difficult, yet compassionate, conversations that urged her toward courageous self-reflection. This same pastor has been visiting Kelly for almost 16 years. Her commitment to Kelly, along with that of the prison chaplain and chaplaincy interns, provided steady, ongoing love that fostered change. So by the time I met Kelly in 2010 she had already undergone a significant transformation. She was, in the words of the Apostle Paul, a \"new creation\" (2 Cor. 5:17). In the theology program, Kelly found her own voice and came to see that her reflections on Christian faith could be a gift to the wider church \"on the outside,\" as well as in prison. By studying historical and contemporary Christian thinkers, Kelly became part of the conversations that make the Christian tradition dynamic. She asked honest questions about her relationship to God, others and the world. She read scripture and grappled with centuries-old theological questions. She discovered her authentic theological voice in the midst of this work. \"From the start of the theology class I felt this hunger,\" she said in her 2011 graduation speech. \"I became so hungry for theology, and what all the classes had to offer; you could call me a glutton.\" One of the great joys of being a theology professor is getting to know students holistically, not only as thinkers, but also as human beings wrestling with some of life's most urgent questions. My relationship with Kelly had this quality from the start. But it deepened six months into the year when a new warden arrived at the prison. In her graduation speech, Kelly described this moment: . \"There came a time when ... my worst fears became my reality -- I was pulled from the courses. I was taken from my theological community. Being pulled from the program devastated me as badly as if someone had just told me one of my appeals had been turned down. \"Since I couldn't go to the theology class ... the instructors came to me. Still, this was far from being ideal because now I had to have class and community through a gate. It was hard ... but I pushed on. I pushed on because of that hunger. That gate ... was meant to keep everyone and everything separated from me. But that gate couldn't keep out the knowledge that I was so hungry for, nor friendship and community. And it sure couldn't keep out God.\" This change afforded us the chance to have two hours of one-on-one conversation every Friday. We continued to read theological texts together, including a book by then-Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. Williams describes healing and restoration as the act of facing our painful memories, \"the ruins of the past,\" and building from them here and now. Restoration, Williams writes, \"is going back to the memories of the painful, humiliating past and bringing them to redemption in the present ... to Christ [who] comes to repair the devastation.\" I sat with Kelly as she went back over some of her own painful memories, took responsibility for them and showed profound remorse about who she had been and what she had done. Indeed, the power of these moments -- when Kelly looked me in the eye and confessed concrete sins, when we spoke of God's love and forgiveness -- will stay with me forever. Kelly embraced what Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German pastor-theologian and Nazi resister, calls \"costly grace.\" For Bonhoeffer, \"cheap grace\" is seeking God's forgiveness as a \"cover-up for one's sins, for which one has no remorse and ... even less desire to be set free.\" In contrast, costly grace requires rigorously following Jesus in a way that leads to continuous, visible transformation, what the New Testament calls the fruits of redemption. The fruits of Kelly's redemption are now well-documented: reconciliation with her children, ministry to inmates full of despair, counsel to troubled youth and daily concern for others. On the night Kelly thought would be her last, she spent the evening writing a letter to her fellow inmates, urging them not to worry about her, but to be encouraged. Most poignant for Kelly are the writings of German theologian J\u00fcrgen Moltmann, who is widely known as the \"theologian of hope\" and with whom Kelly began corresponding in 2010. Moltmann shows that biblical hope is not a hope that gives up on this life and looks for something better beyond the grave. Rather, hope makes manifest the kingdom of God now --God's intended social order \"on earth as it is in heaven\" (Matt. 6:10). Biblical hope \"revolutionizes and transforms the present.\"  It is the hope of the psalmist who \"looks for the goodness of God in this life\" (Ps. 27:13).  In the words of Kelly's favorite scripture, it is a hope that proclaims: \"I shall not die but live, and declare the works of the Lord\" (Ps 118:17). In Kelly's own words: . \"The theology program has shown me that hope is still alive and that, despite a gate or a guillotine hovering over my head, I still possess the ability to prove that I am human. Labels on anyone can be notoriously misleading and unforgiving things. But no matter the label attached to me, I have the capacity and the unstoppable desire to accomplish something positive and have a lasting impact ... Even prison cannot erase my hope or conviction that the future is not settled for me, or anyone.\" Many people have asked me in recent days how I have been transformed by my friendship with Kelly and by Kelly's journey of hope. While I struggle to find adequate words, what I do know is that Kelly's story pushes the logic of Christian faith to its outermost limits. It pushes Christians to reexamine and reaffirm the truths we proclaim about repentance, forgiveness, redemption and hope. Indeed, even professional theologians and life-long pastors struggle with the weight of the claims we make. Today, Kelly's life hangs in the balance. The state of Georgia on Monday issued a last-minute postponement of her execution, citing concerns about the drugs that were to be used to kill her. The Department of Corrections has said that it plans to resume executions once an analysis of the drugs is complete. While Gov. Nathan Deal does not have the formal power to commute Kelly's sentence to life in prison, I join more than 1,100 faith leaders from across the nation, including more than 500 from Georgia, who have signed a letter urging the governor to use his political influence to save Kelly's life and to speak out publicly against her execution. I call on all people of good will to reach out to Gov. Deal and to Georgia state legislators to demand a more just, merciful, and accountable system of justice -- for Kelly and for all. As theologian Richard Amesbury wrote, \"If the life even of a convicted murderer can be turned around and so radically redirected, then none of us is without hope.\" We need to hear Kelly Gissendaner proclaim to us -- as much as we proclaim to her -- that the promises of God are real.","highlights":"The execution of Kelly Gissendaner was postponed due to concerns over injection drugs .\nMcBride: In her time on death row, Gissendaner has discovered hope through theology ."}
{"article":"Hull defender Michael Dawson will lead his side into Sunday's Barclays Premier League clash with Chelsea insisting confidence levels have not been hit by a fortnight of frustration which has plunged them deeper into the relegation dogfight. Missed opportunities against Sunderland and Leicester have left the Tigers hovering three points above the drop zone while their hopes have also been hit by the news that striker Nikica Jelavic faces six weeks on the sidelines after knee surgery. On the face of it a clash with Jose Mourinho's champions elect is the last thing the struggling hosts might wish for but former Tottenham star Dawson is adamant his team can once again rise to the occasion this weekend. Michael Dawson (centre) says his side are not low in confidence and have a great fighting spirit . Dawson said: 'We have got a spirit and a fight about us and we have certainly shown that in recent weeks. It's all about fine margins and at the end of the day we picked up points that might be valuable at the end of the season. 'It is a massive challenge playing against all the top teams but we have been away to Anfield and Manchester City and Arsenal and picked points up and we could quite easily have picked up all three against City.' The Tigers' survival hopes took another hit last week when fellow strugglers Burnley upset Manuel Pellegrini's men at Turf Moor but Dawson says that upset can provide inspiration for his own side on Sunday. The Hull captain remonstrates with referee Jonathan Moss following Tom Huddlestone's sending off . 'You do look at other results, there's no hiding that, and seeing that kind of result definitely gives us that belief,' added Dawson. 'On paper it wasn't one you would look at but credit to Burnley who showed what the Premier League is about.' Jelavic's untimely absence will mean another chance for either record signing Abel Hernandez or Sone Aluko in attack, but the game is likely to come too early for long-term injured trio Mohamed Diame, Robbie Brady and Liam Rosenior. However despite Jelavic's grim immediate prognosis, boss Steve Bruce is determined not to completely write the Croatian striker off and believes he could yet return to play a part in the potentially crucial end-of-season run-in. Bruce said: 'Being realistic we think it's going to be at least six weeks. It could force him out for the rest of the season, but knowing Jela the way I do I am sure he is going to give it a good shot.' Nikica Jelavic faces up to six weeks out and is all but ruled out of their Premier League survival bid .","highlights":"Michael Dawson has praised his team-mates for their fighting spirit .\nThe Hull captain thinks this mentality will help them survive relegation .\nHull face leaders Chelsea at the KC Stadium on Sunday in a crucial clash .\nClick here for all the latest Hull news ."}

Saracens have now beaten their opponents in 10 of their last 11 fixtures as Wasps threw away an early 17-3 lead. Brilliant tries from Christian Wade and Elliot Daly with two conversions and a penalty from Andy Goode had seen them build up that lead but after that first 20 minutes, the Saracens pack were too strong and ensured the visitors were deserved winners. Nathan Hughes  is tackled by Brad Barritt \u00a0during the Aviva Premiership match between Wasps and Saracens . Saracens scored two tries through Jackson Wray and Chris Wyles with Alex Goode converting both and adding four penalties. Lock Bradley Davies returned from Welsh squad duties to start for Wasps but prop Jake Cooper-Woolley was ruled out with concussion. Italian international, Lorenzo Cittadini was his replacement. Saracens were able to include England's Alex Goode, Mako Vunipola, Brad Barritt and Richard Wigglesworth in their starting line-up. Wing David Strettle was rested so there was a call-up for Wyles. Elliot Daly celebrates with teammates after scoring a try during the match  at The Ricoh Arena . A poor kick from Chris Ashton gave Wasps an early platform in the opposition 22 and when Saracens were penalised, Andy Goode made no mistake with his kick to put his side ahead. However that score was soon nullified when Alex Goode took his first kicking chance to tie up the scores. After 13 minutes Wasps were back in front with the first try of the game. Well-timed passes from Ashley Johnson and Daly gave Wade his chance and the wing powered away down the right flank to kick ahead deep into the opposition 22. Christian Wade Alex Goode to the ball to score the first try during the Aviva Premiership match . Saracens should have cleared the danger but the ball ran loose for Wade to pounce and score with Andy Goode converting with a superb touchline kick. Minutes later, Wasps extended their lead with an even better try. Inside his own half, Andy Goode fed Daly with seemingly nothing on but the Wasps centre mesmerised the visitors' defence by running 55 metres to score. Andy Goode converted and the hosts held a healthy 17-3 lead. Back came Saracens to mount a period of pressure and they were rewarded when Wray finished off a driving line-out for the try, which Alex Goode converted before adding a penalty. Daly  breaks clear to score a try during the Aviva Premiership match between Wasps and Saracens . After 28 minutes, Saracens went ahead for the first time after Wasps lost a line-out in their own half. Vunipola brushed past Johnson's tackle before a neat chip from Wigglesworth saw Wyles collect and hold off the attentions of Wade for the touchdown. Alex Goode converted but his namesake missed a penalty for Wasps with the last kick of the half so Saracens led 20-17 at the interval. Within a minute of the restart, Ashton was yellow carded for a high tackle on Rob Miller but the home side could not take advantage as the wing returned with the scoreboard unchanged apart from Alex Goode's third penalty. Chris Wyles  slides over to score his team's try despite the tackle from Christian Wade of Wasps . Saracens' pack became the dominant force with some skillful kicking from Wigglesworth keeping them on the front foot and they should have gained further reward but Alex Goode's penalty rebounded back off a post. Saracens suffered a blow when Barritt limped off to be replaced by Tim Streather but the visitors still led 23-17 at the end of the third quarter. When Saracens were penalised at a scrum, Andy Goode had a chance to reduce the arrears but surprisingly he was off target and the opposition made him pay. Clever play from Ben Ransom secured the visitors an attacking position and Wasps replacement Guy Thompson pulled down a driving line-out to go to the sin-bin and allow Alex Goode to boot his fourth penalty.","highlights":"Wasps suffered a 26-17 defeat at the hands of Saracens at the Ricoh Arena .\nBrilliant tries from Christian Wade and Elliot Daly had given them the lead .\nBut the Saracens pack were too strong and the visitors left the winners .\nSaracens suffered a blow when Brad Barritt limped off with an injury ."}

McCall made three changes from the side who were held to a home draw by Queen of the South in midweek. Youngster Tom Walsh was handed his first start and Kenny Miller and Sebastien Faure were added to the side. The supporters were cheering again after just nine minutes when Rangers surged into an early lead.

{"article":"(CNN)At least a dozen tourists on two cruises that visited the Tunisian capital, Tunis, are among more than 20 people who were gunned down this week at the country's Bardo National Museum, officials said. Details of the victims in Wednesday's attack have been slow to emerge. Some of the bodies remained unidentified at a morgue, a forensic official said Friday. Here's what is known so far: . Among the first victims to be named was Briton Sally Adey. The UK Foreign Office confirmed her identity. She was a 57-year-old retired solicitor who was on a dream vacation with her husband, Robert, Britain's Telegraph newspaper reported. The couple were married in 1984 and have two children -- Molly, a 20-year-old university student, and Harry, a 23-year-old musician, the newspaper said. Julia Holden, a close friend of the Adeys, gave a statement to CNN that said, \"Sally Adey was a much loved daughter, wife and mother. The family are devastated by her loss. They are also saddened for others who have lost people they love, and for those who have been hurt.\" Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said consular staff were helping Adey's family. \"The extremists, the terrorists, they hate democracy,\" UK Prime Minister David Cameron said. \"They hate the idea that people should be able to choose their own government. But we must not let democracy, freedom, the rule of law, the things that we hold dear and people in Tunisia hold dear -- we must not let them be defeated or undermined by these extremists and terrorists. \"That is the battle we are engaged in, but I'm confident, if we stick to our values, we will win through.\" Two more victims were named as Spanish couple Antoni Cirera Perez and Dolores Sanchez Rami. They were on a cruise that stopped in Tunis. Francisco Cabezas, a sportswriter with the newspaper El Mundo, wrote that his neighbors for eight years had loved children and walking in the mountains. Perez loved Formula 1 races. The sportswriter wrote that he recently invited the couple over to meet his baby daughter, Adria. They were ecstatic to hear the cries of a baby, he said. Perez instructed him softly, \"Let her cry, that is what she has to do.\" President Francois Hollande, who said he stood firm with Tunisia, confirmed that three French citizens were killed and seven others wounded. He told reporters at an EU Council meeting in Brussels, Belgium, that two of the wounded were in serious condition. The five who are slightly hurt are expected to return shortly to France. Bruno Masarotto, a spokesman for the Town Hall of Aussillon, in southern France, confirmed that Jean-Claude Tissier, a former municipal councilor for Aussillon, was one of the French citizens killed. Tissier, 71, was a hairdresser and had two sons, one of whom is deceased, he said. Fellow hairdresser Serge Fournes said he and Tissier were part of the same theater group. He said it was a \"paradox\" that his friend, who was passionate about art, should die in a museum. Fournes said Tissier lived with his girlfriend. Media reports said the couple was on vacation together, but the girlfriend's condition wasn't known. A second victim was named as Christophe Tinois, 59, from Castelsarrasin, in southern France. The Castelsarrasin Town Hall confirmed his death and said Tinois had worked with the horse-riding community there. He had at least two daughters. Friend Jean-Luc Terriers said the girls' mother died about two or three years ago and that Tinois took care of her until the end. He had recently met another woman and they were in Tunis on a cruise, he said. It wasn't clear whether she was hurt in the attack. The Town Hall has organized a tribute ceremony for Tinois on Saturday morning. The name of the third French victim has not yet been confirmed. Two Colombians were killed, Javier Camelo, and his mother, Miriam Martinez Camelo. Javier Camelo also held Australian citizenship. His father survived the attack. He is a retired Colombian army general. The family was on a trip to celebrate the son's graduation. Four of the victims were from the country's northern Piedmont region. The media office of Turin City Hall named them as: Orazio Conte, 54, a Turin city administration employee; Antonella Sesino, also 54 and a city administration employee; Francesco Caldara, 64, a retiree; and Giuseppina Biella, 70. A vigil was held Thursday night in Turin to support the families of the victims and stand against terrorism. In a telegram from the Vatican, Pope Francis expressed \"strong condemnation to all the acts against peace and the holiness of human life.\" The Italian Foreign Ministry told CNN that six Italian tourists were wounded. Russia's Foreign Ministry confirmed the death of a tourist, Galina Potapenko, who was born in 1962, according to Russian state news agency Tass. Her remains were \"found among the earlier unidentified bodies of foreign tourists,\" it said. Another tourist, Nadezhda Lukyanova, was being treated for a wound to her arm at a military hospital in Tunis, Tass cited the ministry as saying. The two women had met up in the southern Russian city of Krasnodar, where Potapenko lived, and traveled to Italy together, the Russian Embassy said earlier, according to Tass. They reached Tunisia on an Italian cruise. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said three Japanese nationals were killed and three others wounded. Public broadcaster NHK and other local media said the dead were all women: Machiyo Narisawa, 66; Chiemi Miyazaki, 49; and Miyazaki's 22-year-old daughter, Haruka Miyazaki. Haruka Miyazaki had just graduated from a university, the media outlets reported. Two Poles and a Belgian were listed among those killed. Three Tunisians were also among the dead. CNN's Junko Ogura, Karl Penhaul, Ray Sanchez, Livia Borghese, Jessica King, Claudia Rebaza, Richard Allen Greene, Sandrine Amiel, Emma Burrows and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","highlights":"Details of the victims of the attack on the Tunisian museum start to emerge .\nAmong the dead are four Italians, three French citizens, three Japanese and two Spaniards ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Incumbent Goodluck Jonathan phoned former military leader Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday to concede defeat in Nigeria's presidential elections, Buhari's party says. Jonathan acknowledged the phone call and his defeat in a written statement to his countrymen. \"I thank all Nigerians once again for the great opportunity I was given to lead this country and assure you that I will continue to do my best at the helm of national affairs until the end of my tenure,\" he said. The Independent National Electoral Commission is still announcing the final tally in the polls, but early numbers indicate Buhari, now the President-elect, has an overwhelming majority of votes. Buhari ruled Nigeria from late 1983 until August 1985 after ousting his predecessor in a coup. His 20-month rule was known for what he described as a \"war on indiscipline,\" a tough regime that some say was marred by human rights abuses. The 72-year-old  retired major general's experience as a military ruler has variably been viewed as a plus or minus in present-day Nigeria, where the government has been locked in a deadly battle with the militant group Boko Haram. His campaign has focused on security and ending corruption in Nigeria. Read more: Who is Nigeria's Muhammadu Buhari? Violent protests after elections Saturday sparked calls for calm from the two main candidates and a warning by the United States and Britain against political interference. Demonstrators fired gunshots and torched a local electoral office in Nigeria's oil-rich Rivers state on Sunday as they marched to protest the elections amid claims of vote-rigging and voter intimidation. After the protests in Rivers, Buhari's All Progressives Congress demanded the elections there be canceled. \"There's been so much violence in Rivers state that it's just not tenable,\" party spokesman Lai Mohammed said. But the People's Democratic Party disputed the accusation, saying the election was \"credible and the result reflects the overwhelming wish of the people of Rivers state to support President Goodluck Jonathan.\" Both candidates took to social media to call for calm. \"I want to urge all Nigerians to also wait patiently for the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to collate and announce results,\" Jonathan said on his Facebook account. \"Fellow Nigerians, I urge you to exercise patience and vigilance as we wait for all results to be announced,\" Buhari said on Twitter. Jonathan and  Buhari last week issued a pledge reaffirming their commitment to \"free, fair and credible elections\" after their signing of  the Abuja Accord in January. In his statement Tuesday, Jonathan said; \"I promised the country free and fair elections. I have kept my word.\" He advised anyone upset with the results to follow due process and stay away from further violence. \"As I have always affirmed, nobody's ambition is worth the blood of any Nigerian. The unity, stability and progress of our dear country is more important than anything else,\" he said. Read more: Democracy was the real winner . More than 800 people were killed in post-election violence across Nigeria's north in 2011 after charges that those elections were illegitimate. Nigeria's vote had been scheduled for February 14, but on February 7, Nigeria's election commission announced it would be postponed for six weeks because of security concerns, with the military needing more time to secure areas controlled by Boko Haram. The controversial decision was unpopular among many Nigerians and led to widespread protests. Jonathan has been criticized for not doing enough to combat Boko Haram, which is waging a campaign of terror aimed at instituting a stricter version of Sharia law in Nigeria. On Saturday, residents in the northeastern state of Gombe said at least 11 people were killed and two more injured in attacks at polling stations, apparently by Boko Haram extremists. CNN's Christian Purefoy reported from Lagos, Nigeria, while CNN's Susannah Cullinane and Stephanie Busari wrote from London.","highlights":"Incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan acknowledges defeat, says he delivered on promise of fair elections .\nMuhammadu Buhari's party says Jonathan called to concede even before final results are announced .\nBuhari is a 72-year-old retired major general who ruled in Nigeria in the 1980s ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Could mobile technology turn the tide in the fight to eliminate racism from football? Anti-racism organization Kick It Out (KIO) says there's been a 35% rise in fans reporting abusive behavior committed by other fans -- and that's largely due to a new phone app. \"The app has had a massive impact,\" KIO media and communications manager Richard Bates told CNN, noting that it accounted for 27% of all complaints. \"Self-policing is so important when it comes to stamping out racism in football. People are confident that their complaints will be taken seriously.\" The 184 reported incidents recorded during the last five months of 2014 covered racial and religious discrimination, as well as sexual orientation, gender and disability offenses. The increase was measured against the same period the year before. KIO's mobile phone application, which was released in 2013, encourages fans to report incidents anonymously by pressing a \"Report It!\" tab and entering the name of the football ground, positioning of the offender, and incident details. Although contact details of the person reporting the incident are requested, KIO emphasized that the anonymity of the tool is key. Every single objection logged by fans, either on the phone, via email, or on the app, triggers an investigation by the English Football Association (FA). These include 73 incidents on social media (a 24% increase), which have so far led to 21 instances of the offender being identified, and at times having their accounts deleted. The FA, which released its own witness complaint guidelines in 2013, encouraged fans to be proactive in flagging up incidents. \"Reporting abuse, whether witnessed or experienced, is an important part of the game's overall anti-discrimination work,\" said an FA spokesperson. \"There are clear ways for players and fans to do this, and these improved procedures should result in more reports in the future.\" Bates admitted that it takes \"bravery and courage\" for fans to record photographic evidence on their phones, but pointed to the effect British expatriate Paul Nolan has had after he filmed Chelsea fans physically stopping a black man from getting on the Paris metro last month. The amateur video obtained by The Guardian newspaper, and posted on its website, shows the man make multiple attempts to board a train at Richelieu-Drouot station, only to be pushed away each time by a group of passengers. The Chelsea fans can then be heard chanting: \"We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it.\" Chelsea were in France to play Paris Saint-Germain in a Champions League first-leg tie - Europe's premier football tournament -- which finished 1-1. Five people have been identified and suspended by Chelsea, who have launched an ongoing investigation. Later in February, KIO says it contacted the police over social media footage which showed men, thought to be West Ham fans, singing anti-Semitic songs on a train while traveling to Tottenham Hotspur's White Hart Lane ground ahead of an English Premier League game. \"Would we know that these Paris and London incidents had happened if they weren't on video?\" Bates asks, adding that KIO is considering an option to upload video and still images of offenders directly to a complaint log on the app. \"If you have video footage and you can issue that retrospectively, it can make it easier to identify the perpetrators,\" he says. In a report released in 2013 entitled \"English Football's Inclusion and Anti-Discrimination Action Plan\", the FA explicitly talks about \"raising confidence in the reporting and disciplinary process at grassroots level.\" KIO's jurisdiction extends to all of English football, including the amateur ranks. It is one of the few independent bodies in world sports which solicits complaints from fans in order to weed out abusive behavior. It also polices the actions of players, which has embroiled the organization in controversy of its own in the past. In 2012, Rio Ferdinand refused to wear a KIO T-shirt before a match while playing for Manchester United. He was protesting a perceived lack of response by the governing bodies against John Terry after the Chelsea defender was accused of racially abusing his brother, Anton Ferdinand of Queens Park Rangers. Terry was banned for four matches and fined \u00a3220,000 by the FA for his actions.","highlights":"Thirty-five percent increase in abuses reported .\nAll complaints lead to an inquiry by England's Football Association .\nSelf-policing fans encouraged to be careful ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Robert Durst appeared to be prepared for life on the lam when FBI agents arrested him in New Orleans. The millionaire heir, according to court documents, had more than $40,000 in cash with him -- and a neck-to-head latex mask to alter his appearance. The new details about Durst, who's been charged with first-degree murder, emerged Wednesday in court documents supporting a search warrant for his Houston home. It's the latest twist in a whirlwind week for Durst, the subject of HBO's true-crime documentary \"The Jinx.\" He's gone from a man battling suspicions that he killed three people to a frail 71-year-old on suicide watch. Durst, whose real estate developer family is among New York's wealthiest, has a net worth of about $100 million and had been withdrawing large sums of money from various bank accounts, including daily withdrawals of $9,000 over 35 days since October, the court documents said. He's being held on drug and weapons charges in Louisiana as he awaits extradition to Los Angeles to face charges in the 2000 killing of his close friend. It's not the first time he's been accused of murder. He admitted to killing and dismembering his neighbor in a 2003 trial, but he was acquitted after arguing he acted in self-defense. And while he's never been charged in his first wife's 1982 disappearance, her family members say they believe she's dead and that he's the one to blame. FBI agents are also investigating whether Durst could be connected to other unsolved murder cases. The agency is putting out a call to local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where Durst lived over the past five decades, a U.S. law enforcement official said. Unsolved cases in Vermont, upstate New York, the San Francisco Bay area and Southern California are among those getting a new look. Durst's apparent plans to flee began to unravel on Saturday, after an FBI agent approached him from behind at a New Orleans hotel and said, \"Mr. Durst?\" Although Durst had checked into the hotel under the name \"Everette Ward\" and carried a Texas ID card with that name, he turned around when the agent called him by name, according to court documents. In his hotel room, agents found more than $40,000 in cash, mostly in $100 bills packed into small envelopes, a loaded revolver, the rubber mask that covers the head and neck, his actual birth certificate and passport, and marijuana. On Tuesday, authorities made it clear they weren't done looking into Durst, even though he's behind bars. At the Houston condominium building where Durst owns three units and lived for many years, authorities seized compact discs, bank statements, handwritten notes, credit cards and checks, stationery, a cell phone, boxes of court documents, photos and a trash bag of court transcripts. They also left with copies of books that detail the disappearance of his first wife and his legal troubles: \"Without a Trace\" and paperback and hardcover copies of \"A Deadly Secret.\" Journalist Matt Birkbeck, who wrote \"A Deadly Secret,\" said he'd heard Durst read his book, but didn't realize he still had two copies. \"When I first heard that, I was somewhat shocked,\" Birkbeck told CNN, \"and a little disturbed.\" The Los Angeles County district attorney filed a first-degree murder charge against Durst on Monday. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Prosecutors accuse Durst of \"lying in wait\" and killing Susan Berman, a crime writer and his longtime confidante, because she \"was a witness to a crime.\" Berman was shot in the head in her Beverly Hills, California, home in December 2000, shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the disappearance of Durst's first wife, Kathleen McCormack Durst, in 1982. Durst has long maintained he had nothing to do with Berman's death or his wife's disappearance. He's confined to a Louisiana prison's mental health unit after being deemed a danger to himself. On Tuesday, an appeals court granted a request from the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office to move Durst to the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center's mental health unit in St. Gabriel, about an hour's drive from New Orleans. Lawyers for the sheriff's office argued that the jail where Durst was being held until Tuesday night can't accommodate inmates with acute mental health conditions. The appeals court agreed. Durst's lawyer Dick DeGuerin said he \"did not believe\" his client was mentally ill, and that he should remain in Orleans Parish to give the legal team better access to him before a evidentiary hearing scheduled for Monday. DeGuerin has said it's no coincidence authorities arrested Durst the day before the HBO documentary's final episode aired. He said he wasn't surprised about the search of his Texas condo, either. \"They're acting like a bunch of Keystone Kops, particularly after being embarrassed by the TV program,\" he said. \"And I'll be even more surprised if they find anything of any evidentiary value whatsoever.\" Authorities have been mum about what evidence led them to arrest Durst on Saturday, the day before the finale of \"The Jinx\" aired. Court documents reveal some details about their case against him. Four forensic experts concluded a letter sent to police telling them to search for a cadaver in Berman's home was likely written by Durst. For viewers of the HBO documentary, that might not come as a surprise. In \"The Jinx,\" Berman's stepson stumbles upon a signed letter from Durst to Berman's home in Beverly Hills. The handwriting looks similar to the \"cadaver\" letter that tipped off police to the killing, and both letters misspell the word as \"Beverley.\" In the documentary, Durst denies he has anything to do with writing the \"cadaver\" letter, and that he has anything to do with Berman's death. Court documents mention another anonymous letter, sent from New York in January 2001, to a Los Angeles police detective. It was titled \"Possible motive for Susan Berman murder\" and stated that Berman suspected Durst of being involved in his wife's disappearance. It also said Durst planned to visit Berman around the time of her death. In a 2003 murder trial, Durst admitted he'd killed neighbor Morris Black in Galveston, Texas, and chopped up the body. He was acquitted after his attorneys argued he had acted in self-defense, though he later served nine months in prison on felony weapons charges stemming from that case. DeGuerin told reporters Monday that his client didn't kill Berman. \"He's ready to end all the rumor and speculation and have a trial,\" DeGuerin said. It's not clear when a trial would take place. Durst waived his right to fight extradition to Los Angeles, but because prosecutors in New Orleans are pursuing charges against him, he remains jailed there. Investigators believe he planned to travel from New Orleans to Cuba, a law enforcement official told CNN. Investigators found a .38-caliber Smith & Wesson revolver and about 147 grams (5.2 ounces) of marijuana in Durst's hotel room in New Orleans, according to court documents. He was booked on charges of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of a firearm in the presence of a controlled dangerous substance. Court documents filed Tuesday say Durst will receive medications while imprisoned, \"including but not limited to hydrocodone as needed for pain.\" CNN's Evan Perez, Chandler Friedman, Jeremy Grisham, Dave Alsup, Holly Yan, Chris Welch, Shimon Prokupecz and Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.","highlights":"The FBI is looking into unsolved murder cases in areas where Robert Durst has lived .\nHe's charged with first-degree murder in the slaying of his longtime friend in 2000 .\nCourt documents reveal he had more than $40,000 in cash and a mask when agents arrested him ."}
{"article":"London (CNN)The discovery of the remains of Richard III beneath a car parking lot in the English city of Leicester in 2012 sparked excitement around the world. Now those bones are to be reburied following a series of commemorations full of the pomp and circumstance befitting of a royal farewell. In the years since it was exhumed, the King's skeleton has given up plenty of secrets -- and research continues to find out more. Say the name Richard III to most people, and the image that will spring to mind is of Shakespeare's villain, a cruel, conniving figure whose nasty character is reflected in his physical abnormalities, a \"poisonous bunch-backed toad.\" History, they say, is written by the victors, and according to the Tudors and their most famous playwright, Richard was hunchbacked, with a withered hand and limping gait, \"deformed, unfinished ... and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as I halt by them.\" For the archaeologists searching for Richard's remains, the sight of the freshly-uncovered skeleton's twisted spine was the moment the hairs began to stand up on the back of their necks; tests later revealed the King suffered from idiopathic adolescent-onset scoliosis. But while the skeleton's curved vertebrae are striking, experts say the resulting disability would not have been obvious in Richard III when he was alive. It would have meant his right shoulder was slightly higher than the other, but this was likely disguised by clothing, and so only apparent to the King's closest family and confidantes. READ MORE: Richard III's spine twisted, not hunched . The most famous portraits of Richard III depict him as dark-haired and steely eyed, but they were painted some 25 to 30 years after his death, and DNA tests on the remains suggest they are far from accurate. Genetic specialist Turi King, from the University of Leicester, said analysis of various genetic markers offered clues to the King's appearance, suggesting he was actually fair haired and had blue eyes. \"[There are] genes that we know are involved in coding for hair and eye color,\" she told CNN in December 2014. \"The genetic evidence shows he had a 96% probability of having blue eyes, and a 77% probability of having blond hair, though this can darken with age.\" This would mean that the painting of Richard III held by the Society of Antiquaries of London is the closest approximation we have to his real appearance: It shows him with grey-blue eyes and lighter brown hair than other portraits. READ MORE: DNA clue to Richard III's appearanceREAD MORE: Is this the face of Richard III? It is perhaps not surprising that a monarch would have a taste for the finer things in life, but heron -- really? Well yes -- in the medieval period wildfowl such as heron, egret and even swan would have featured heavily on the high-protein menus of the aristocracy. Scientists at the British Geological Survey measured the levels of isotopes including oxygen, strontium, nitrogen and carbon in Richard III's remains, revealing clues to what he ate and drank. They spotted a dramatic change in the last few years of his life -- suggesting his dietary habits became markedly richer once he became King. \"Obviously, Richard was a nobleman beforehand, and so his diet would be reasonably rich already,\" explained isotope geochemist Angela Lamb, who led the study. \"But once he became king we would expect him to be wining and dining more, banqueting more. \"We have the menu from his coronation banquet and it was very elaborate -- lots of wildfowl, including real 'delicacies' such as peacock and swan, and fish -- carp, pike and so on.\" READ MORE:  King's bones reveal luxury lifestyle . Something in that rich diet made Richard III sick: Scientists from the University of Cambridge and the University of Leicester found evidence the King was suffering from a roundworm infection when he died. Researchers examining soil samples from the pelvis and skull of the skeleton spotted roundworm eggs in the area where the dead monarch's intestines would have been. Roundworm eggs -- in this case Ascaris lumbricoides -- are ingested via contaminated food, water or soil; once hatched and matured, the worms can grow up to a foot long. \"Despite Richard's noble background, it appears that his lifestyle did not completely protect him from intestinal parasite infection, which would have been very common at the time,\" said Dr Jo Appleby, from the University of Leicester, who exhumed the King's remains. \"We would expect nobles of this period to have eaten meats such as beef, pork and fish regularly, but there was no evidence for the eggs of the beef, pork or fish tapeworm,\" said Dr Piers Mitchell of the University of Cambridge, adding that the lack of tapeworms suggested the food Richard III ate was thoroughly cooked. READ MORE: Richard III had roundworm infection . Richard III was the last English King to die in battle, at Bosworth on August 22, 1485. In his \"Anglica Historia,\" the Italian Polydore Vergil, recorded that: \"King Richard alone was killed fighting manfully in the thickest press of his enemies.\" When archaeologists studied the remains unearthed in Leicester, they found evidence of 11 of wounds inflicted at or around the time of his death: Nine to his skull and two to other parts of his body. The position of the injuries suggest that Richard had lost both his horse and his helmet when he was set upon by opposition troops. \"The most likely injuries to have caused the king's death are the two to the inferior aspect of the skull -- a large sharp force trauma possibly from a sword or staff weapon, such as a halberd or bill, and a penetrating injury from the tip of an edged weapon,\" said Professor Guy Rutty, who said the wounds were consistent with accounts of what happened to him at Bosworth. Tests also found an injury to the inside of Richard III's pelvis which supports contemporary reports that his body was subjected to acts of ritual humiliation after his death.

{"article":"Ferguson, Missouri (CNN)Ferguson's police chief and other city officials are already out. Now some residents have told the Missouri city they'll try to oust the mayor, too. Five residents Friday filed an affidavit saying they'll try to force a referendum on whether to remove Mayor James Knowles -- capping a tumultuous week in a community grappling not only with last year's fatal shooting of teenager Michael Brown, but also Wednesday's wounding of two police officers shot during a protest. A group supporting the filing, Organization for Black Struggle, a 35-year-old St. Louis-based activist group, said the five would try to collect enough signatures -- 15% of the city's registered voters -- in the next 60 days. The five \"initiated recall (attempt) due to Mayor Knowles' failure to adequately rein in an out-of-control police department during the protests following Mike Brown's death,\" the activist group said. The city government acknowledged Saturday that it received the affidavit. Earlier this week, the police chief and the city manager resigned in the wake of a U.S. Justice Department report alleging institutionalized racism at just about every level of Ferguson's municipal government, including the police department. Residents elect City Council members, who in turn appoint the city manager. The city manager directs and supervises all city departments, including police. The top municipal court clerk was fired earlier in connection with racist emails. This month's Justice Department report was initiated after one of Ferguson's police officers, Darren Wilson, shot and killed African-American teen Michael Brown in August, a shooting that spurred months of protests. Wilson, a white officer who said he shot Brown in self-defense, will not be charged in the case -- a grand jury declared it wouldn't indict him in November, and the Justice Department said this month that it would not bring federal civil rights charges in the case. Wilson resigned from the department in November, citing security concerns. Knowles indicated Friday he won't be stepping down. \"I think it's important to recognize that there's a lot of people who may be angry at the situation; there's a lot of people who are frustrated in this community with the way things have gone down,\" the mayor, who is white, told CNN. \"But there's a lot of people who still -- and who have expressed this to me -- express confidence in both my willingness, and members of the (City) Council's willingness, to listen, to be responsive, and to make changes as necessary,\" he continued. \"People in the community recognize this, now, not everybody. I didn't win every time with 100% of the vote. But I can tell you there are ways to remove me if that is the will of the people,\" the mayor said. Blake Ashby, a white resident of Ferguson, said Friday that he believed Knowles has \"consciously tried to reach out to all parts\" of the city of 21,000 people. \"If we lose Mayor Knowles, we lose a force for change, and it will be harder to make the changes that the DOJ (Department of Justice) is asking for,\" Ashby said. Rasheen Aldridge, a black member of a commission charged with recommending reforms in Ferguson, said  that Knowles needed to resign in the wake of the DOJ report. \"He knew what was going on during his watch,\" said Aldridge, a member of the Ferguson Commission, which Gov. Jay Nixon formed last year. Investigators still are seeking breaks in the case of two police officers who were shot Wednesday night during a protest in Ferguson. While the demonstrators' focus was Ferguson, neither of the wounded officers works for that police department. One is from Webster Groves, a St. Louis suburb 13 miles south of Ferguson. The officer -- a 32-year-old with seven years' experience -- was shot at the high point of his cheek, just under his right eye, police said. The other was hit in the shoulder and the bullet came out the middle of his back. He is a 41-year-old officer with the St. Louis County Police who has been in law enforcement for 14 years. Both were treated and released. \"I cannot tell you an arrest is imminent, and there's certainly no one in custody,\" St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told reporters Friday afternoon. \"The detectives are working this investigation around the clock, and they will not rest until we have a conclusion in this investigation,\" the chief said. Police have \"several leads,\" he said. \"I think we have a pretty good general idea of where we think the shots came from.\" Sara Sidner reported from Ferguson, Missouri. Jason Hanna reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Ed Payne and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","highlights":"Group says mayor failed to rein in police during protests after Michael Brown's 2014 death .\nMayor won't step down, saying \"there are ways to remove me\""}
{"article":"Brisbane (CNN)Bras hang from the antlers of a pair of moose heads above the bar inside an old music hall. Dim red light shines on classic leather booths. You push through a crowd dancing to a live rockabilly band and head to the toilet, tipsy. Then something weird happens -- you exit the washroom and find yourself in a different bar. The early 1900s dance hall with chandeliers has vanished. Suddenly, you're in a whimsical bar with a pirate serving drinks. No, you haven't had too much to drink and the washroom isn't a passageway through a time-space continuum. You've simply stepped into the maritime-themed Mermaid Bar. Inside Lefty's Old Time Music Hall, the Mermaid Bar is an example of the latest nightlife trend in Brisbane -- hidden bars. Sultry old days . \"We actually didn't mean to turn the Mermaid into a secret bar,\" says Mick Dwyer, general manager of Lefty's. \"We were just lazy and didn't publicize it.\" The story behind the hidden bar takes in a bit of sultry local history. Before Lefty's moved in, the building was occupied by the Velvet Cigar, a longtime strip club. Jamie Webb, owner of local restaurant Peasant and Cabiria, took over the place and renovated it, preserving some of the old establishment's bawdy touches. \"We loved the mirror too much to take it down,\" says Webb, referring to the long mirror that still runs the length of one wall. \"It used to be in front of the dance floor for the girls, but we turned the dance floor into booths.\" \"If you look at the floor, you can still see some of the holes where dancing poles used to be,\" says Dwyer. A list of prices for services rendered by different girls still hangs inside the toilet. The bar counter upstairs is where customers once paid for extra services from dancers before entering a small room (now the Mermaid Bar, which sells beer in cans). Mermaid Bar: Secret escape . \"There are actually three entrances to the Mermaid Bar,\" says Webb of the hidden bar. \"It's my favorite place. It's a lot of loud fun out there at Lefty's sometimes, and the Mermaid is like my escape.\" The small Mermaid is bright, with light shining through the windows. Sharks hang from the ceiling and paintings of mermaids adorn the walls. People love the Mermaid for different reasons. \"Some like the bartender dressed up as a pirate,\" says Dwyer. \"Some say it's the cannon on the pirate ship model behind the bar.\" That pirate bartender, Dean Moready, says the apple rum made from fresh-pressed apple juice is the real crowd-pleaser. About those bras on the moose antlers . While the Mermaid is a rum bar, Lefty's is a whiskey bar -- each has about 100 varieties of rum or whiskey, and a food menu. Three bands usually perform each night at Lefty's and the bar always gets busy after 9 p.m. So what's up with the bras on the moose heads? \"I once dared a customer on a hen night to sling a bra to the horn to win a free shot,\" says Webb. \"She did and it has become a tradition ever since.\" \"We have a strict bra-only policy.\" Lefty's Old Time Music Hall and Mermaid Bar, 15 Caxon St., Brisbane, Australia; daily 5 p.m.-3 a.m.; +61 555 9447539 . More hidden Brisbane bars . The Mermaid is one of a handful of secrets bars in Brisbane. It only takes a willingness to push past a few unmarked doors to find more secret drinking holes scattered around the city. Walrus . A bar at a famed historic hotel -- how secret can that be? Turns out the airy courtyard bar in the landmark Regatta Hotel is just a smokescreen for the Walrus, the secret bar hidden beneath it. An unassuming doorway that looks like the entry to a basement storeroom is marked with just a small sign hinting that something grander might exist behind it. \"It really was a storeroom,\" says a manager at the Walrus. \"We have been hoping to make use of the space, but it wasn't until after the big flood in 2011 that we renovated the place into an underground bar.\" The bar has a few treasures -- apart from it's spiced house rum -- including rare Black Tot Last consignment rum (A$250 per shot) and a handful of bottles of Appleton Estate 50-year-old Jamaica Independence Reserve Rum. Regatta Hotel, 543 Coronation Drive, Toowong, Brisbane, Australia; daily 5 p.m. till late; +61 7 3870 9595 . Cobbler . Though you might have difficulty finding it, the Cobbler really is on Browning Street. Apart from a street number, however, there's no sign outside to indicate its presence. Curtains shield the loft-style Cobbler from the street, but brush past these and you'll find a spectacular drink library downstairs, and an upstairs room featuring graffiti on walls and sofas. Warning: it can sometimes take a while for drinks to come while the bartenders juggle bottles and chat with regulars.

After chowing on pork bao bao (pork buns) and pineapple fried rice, you're ready for a drink. Step through a sliding door at the rear of the restaurant and you'll find a little publicized bar that's dark and cozy.

{"article":"West Brom boss Tony Pulis is keeping his cards close to his chest in terms of his goalkeeper selection for Saturday's FA Cup quarter-final at Aston Villa. The Barclays Premier League derby between the two clubs at Villa Park on Tuesday ended in a 2-1 victory for the hosts after a stoppage-time error from Ben Foster saw the Baggies and England shot-stopper give away a penalty that was converted by Christian Benteke. Pulis spoke up for Foster - who has kept six clean sheets in all competitions since the Welshman took over at Albion - after the game. Ben Foster is not guaranteed to keep his place against Aston Villa in the FA Cup quarter-finals . Foster brought down Matthew Lowton to concede a penalty against Villa in Premier League clash on Tuesday . Christian Benteke scored from the spot to give their midlands rivals a late victory at Villa Park . And while refusing to say outright whether or not the 31-year-old would keep his place at the weekend, the head coach once again had praise for Foster at his press conference on Thursday to preview the cup tie. Asked about his goalkeeper selection for Saturday's game, Pulis said: 'I'll be telling the goalkeepers first before I tell you! 'Boaz Myhill has had an injury with a finger, which we have to take into account. 'With the number of clean sheets he has kept (12 overall this season), Ben has been absolutely fantastic. 'Everybody makes mistakes. Goalkeepers get highlighted, like referees, because it can cost you games.' Baggies boss Tony Pulis has backed his No 1 without confirming Foster will keep his place on Saturday . Saido Berahino celebrates while being chased by his team-mates, after netting his 18th goal of the season . With regard to referees, another notable incident from the latter stages of Tuesday's game saw Villa defender Alan Hutton make a nasty-looking challenge on West Brom striker Saido Berahino and the pair square up to each other before each being booked. It appeared Hutton was lucky not to have been sent off by referee Jonathan Moss. And while Pulis was keen on Thursday to avoid hitting out at the official for not doing so, he did once again express his desire for there to be a referral system for managers during games where they get 'two calls' each, something he has spoken about in the past. 'I've seen the challenge back,' said Pulis. Alan Hutton appeared to raise his studs into Berahino's leg during Aston Villa's win over West Brom . Berahino goes down in pain on the touchline following Hutton's nasty challenge on Tuesday . Hutton and Berahino squared up after the challenge (left) and were both booked by referee Jonathan Moss . 'I thought Jon managed the game pretty well, and there are enough people at the moment criticising referees and looking to blame them. 'Jon didn't cost us the game on Tuesday, we cost ourselves the game. 'People make good decisions and bad decisions and you have to accept it - but I'm sure he'll look back at it and maybe will analyse it differently to how he did on the night.' He then added: 'I would have two calls during a game, where managers can call things back. 'You could put advertising on the big screens (at the same time) - the clubs could make some money from it. Pulis has labelled the alleged spitting incident involving Jonny Evans (left) and Papiss Cisse as 'disgusting' 'And it gives a chance to the officials to get right decisions that could be big. They, FIFA and UEFA, have to accept that referees do make mistakes.' Pulis also made his feelings clear about spitting following Wednesday night's incident involving Manchester United defender Jonny Evans and Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse. 'It is disgusting and disgraceful,' Pulis said. 'Spitting should never be anywhere near our game. It should be dealt with.' Pulis, while mindful of his side's ongoing league battle to avoid relegation, says he will try to put his 'strongest team' out on Saturday. Stephane Sessegnon (right) will be given time to cope with 'personal problems' before returning to the team . Forward Victor Anichebe (groin) remains unavailable, and winger Callum McManaman is a doubt due to a foot injury. Pulis has also said West Brom 'have to go careful' with Stephane Sessegnon due to the forward's 'personal problems' - understood to be a family bereavement - and that there are a few 'knocks and niggles' to deal with. Berahino and fellow frontman Brown Ideye have both been playing recently with pain-killing injections.","highlights":"Ben Foster's mistake led to 2-1 defeat by Aston Villa in Premier League .\nTony Pulis has backed England keeper but wouldn't confirm if he will start FA Cup quarter-final clash against Villans on Saturday .\nWest Brom boss wants managers to be allowed to challenge two referee decisions during a game ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Cristiano Ronaldo reached 30 La Liga goals for the season but could not prevent Villarreal from grabbing a share of the points in the Bernabeu Sunday in an entertaining 1-1 draw. Ronaldo put Real ahead with a second half penalty after being pulled down and had 13 shots of goal in a lively display, but his team was unable to secure a fourth consecutive win. Gerard Moreno's thumping low strike 26 minutes from time spoiled the home party and Real has seen its lead at the top cut to two points after Barcelona's win Saturday. The arch rivals meet in El Clasico on March 22, with the title very much up for grabs. Villarreal, coached by Marcelino, even fielded an understrength side as it bids to progress in the Copa del Rey and the Europa League, but should have been ahead early when Iker Casillas made a fine save from Moreno and then Dani Carvajal spectacularly headed Moi Gomez's follow-up effort off the line. Real was turning up the heat and Gareth Bale went close for the European champions with a header, while Raphael Varane went even closer with a header that also just missed the target. Ronaldo was a constant threat and after the break he was pulled down inside the area by Eric Bailly and converted from the spot. Bale and Ronaldo should have doubled the scoreline, but Real was made to pay for its wasted chances when Moreno stunned the home crowd with the leveler. Champion Atletico Madrid missed the chance to close to within five points of Real at the top after being held to a 0-0 draw at Sevilla earlier Sunday. Valencia moved to within a point of Atletico after beaing David Moyes's Real Sociedad 2-0 with a double from Pablo Piatti. Wolfsburg wins thriller . In the Bundesliga, VfL Wolfsburg kept up its dogged pursuit of Bayern Munich with a 5-3 win at Werder Bremen in a thrilling eight-goal encounter. Wolfsburg striker Bas Dost scored a double to make it 14 goals in his last nine appearances but his side still trails Bayern by eight points despite its impressive recent form. The match had been under threat due to a security alert in the north Germany city of Bremen, but it was downgraded with extra police on duty at the 42,000-capacity Weserstadion stadium. Earlier police had made two temporary arrests and searched an Islamic cultural center. Monaco holds PSG .

{"article":"(CNN)History has repeated itself at Indian Wells with the surprise withdrawal of Serena Williams from the semifinal due to a knee injury. Williams' withdrawal comes 14 years after her sister Venus pulled out minutes before the semifinal in 2001 -- also with a knee injury -- a move which led to a tournament boycott, amid claims of racism, that only ended this year. Williams had been due to play Romanian Simona Halep on Friday night, but instead posted news of her withdrawal on Instagram. \"Four months ago I began a journey to play Indian Wells and it was amazing. I never dreamed I could do it. But I would not have been able to do this without my fans. Though it ended early due to injury this year, I have to say I cannot wait to try again next year. Thanks everyone. I love you so much!\" Williams posted. Back in 2001, crowds booed a young Serena as she took on Belgian Kim Clijsters in the final of the competition now known as the BNP Paribas Open. Despite being on home soil, spectators backed Clijsters in scenes former tennis champion and broadcaster Pam Shriver said were difficult to watch. \"You would expect the crowd to be so supportive of the U.S. player, so it clearly was the exact opposite. Because she was American, because she was so young, because she was African-American, predominantly white audience. It was tough, it was tough to listen to,\" Shriver told CNN's Open Court. Shriver watched as spectators booed Serena's father Richard and sister Venus, as they walked down the steps to take their seats for the match. \"That's when we realized this crowd is still really upset by what happened in the semifinals,\" Shriver said. Minutes before the highly-anticipated semifinal between the two sisters, Venus pulled out due to a knee injury. Her withdrawal seemed to add credence to rumors, which the family denies, that the result of the match had been pre-determined by their father, who kept a tight control on his daughters' careers. Despite the booing, Williams beat Clijsters to take the title. But the issue did not end there. Days later, Richard Williams gave a press conference and said the booing amounted to racial abuse, Bill Dwyre, who covered the match for L.A. Times told Open Court. \"Richard Williams had said that the n-word had been used and that the booing was racially motivated. ... that was the beginning of Serena never coming back.\" After 14 years of refusing to play at Indian Wells, Serena Williams, who with her sister has dominated the world rankings for more than a decade, said that she was \"following her heart\" by deciding to rejoin the tournament. \"In order to forgive you have to be able to really let go of everything,\" she told reporters at a pre-match news conference.  Serena said she discussed it with her father in a \"really emotional\" conversation and he agreed. \"He said it would be a big mistake if I didn't go back and I thought that was really admirable,\" Williams said. Before the match, she told reporters that, by returning, she felt like she'd already won. \"I don't think I need to hold the trophy at the end of it. I feel like I'm already holding the trophy. I've never felt that way before,\" she said. \"Just being here is a huge win not only for me but for so many people and it's a wonderful feeling.\" Williams' early exit gives Halep a free pass to the final.","highlights":"Serena Williams pulls out of semifinal due to knee injury .\nSister Venus did the same before 14-year boycott .\nWilliams returned to the tournament for first time since 2001 ."}
{"article":"Luther Burrell has revealed that England's 'Mr Angry' is intent on releasing a month's worth of pent up frustration when Scotland visit Twickenham on Saturday. Mike Brown was knocked unconscious against Italy on February 14 and was forced to sit out the defeat by Ireland after suffering a setback in the return to play protocols for concussion. Now restored to full fitness, Brown returns for England's tilt at reviving their RBS 6 Nations title challenge and Burrell will be only too pleased to hear the fiery full-back barking orders once again. Mike Brown wants to let out all his frustration when he returns to face Scotland according to Luther Burrell . 'It's always good having an angry man behind you, shouting and doing his thing. He's an exciting player,' Burrell said. 'He's constantly on us and is a good leader. He's been itching to get himself right and back out there, just to release some of his anger. Off the pitch he's just as angry. He's just always angry.' England missed the comfort blanket Brown provides at full-back as their Grand Slam quest ground to a halt in Dublin in a result that has seen Ireland reinstated as title favourites. Burrell (centre) is looking forward to having 'Mr Angry' back for their crucial Six Nations clash . Among the combinations that took a step backwards at the Aviva Stadium was the centre partnership of Burrell and Jonathan Joseph, who disappointed after encouraging outings against Wales and Italy. The centre duo were hardly alone in underperforming amid an inexplicably subdued England display, but with only five games remaining until the World Cup - three of them warm up matches for the tournament - opportunities to reassert themselves are running out. Joseph excelled against Wales and Italy, forcing Burrell to take a back seat, and the inside centre's place in the team was under threat until Brad Barritt was ruled out against Scotland by a sprained ankle. The full back has been an ever-present for Stuart Lancaster's side and his loss was a real miss for the squad . Brown (15) was knocked unconscious against Italy and didn't feature in England's defeat in Ireland . Burrell, who has shaken off a calf problem to retain his place in the starting XV, points out that he has taken a selfless approach as his understanding with Joseph grows. 'It's always nice scoring tries, but it's just as nice getting the applause from Jonathan and others for creating that space and doing the hard graft that some people might not pick up on,' he said . 'On and off the field we have a good relationship. We get on really well. We had last weekend off but we've still been speaking to each other. 'It's good to have that relationship because we have a group that has got each other's backs and look out for each other. Jonathan Joseph (left) has arguably been England's most impressive player in the tournament . 'It's important that I create that space for JJ to do his thing, which is obviously something we've seen already in this Six Nations. Given a bit of space, he can be electric in that 13 channel. 'And vice versa if I want the ball in my hands early from him, he now knows to do that. It's pretty exciting. 'We've worked hard on it in training and while we're still building in these early stages, we're happy with how each other's roles are.' England's final training session on Wednesday afternoon in preparation for the penultimate round of the Six Nations was full-blooded, releasing the angst that had built up after the no-show against Ireland. Stuart Lancaster took charge of a full bloodied training session at Pennyhill Park on Wednesday . Head coach Stuart Lancaster was forced to blow the whistle early, fearing the consequences as the intensity of the exchanges between the rival XVs at the squad's Pennyhill Park training camp escalated. 'With a session like that it sets us up nicely for the weekend. It's about trying to replicate that intensity of Test match rugby,' Burrell said. 'It gets a bit feisty at times which is always good and healthy because that shows people care and want the shirt.' England still have a chance of winning the Six Nations but know they can't afford to slip up .","highlights":"Luther Burrell said Mike Brown is ready to release hell on Scotland .\n'Mr Angry' is set to return for England's Six Nations clash at Twickenham .\nBurrell will also retain his place after recovering from a calf injury .\nClick here for all the latest Six Nations news ."}
{"article":"And so finally it arrives. The clash we have been waiting so long for. The top-of-the-bill dust-up which for many is the highlight of the meeting and one which is quite simply too close to call. Nicky Henderson\u2019s Sprinter Sacre versus Gary Moore-trained Sire de Grugy in the Betway Queen Mother Champion Chase. Sprinter Sacre was the imperious winner of the race in 2013 but could not defend his title 12 months ago because of illness. In his absence, Sire de Grugy galloped away with his crown displaying the same disdain for the leaden-footed gallopers chasing him. Barry Geraghty riding Sprinter Sacre celebrates victory in the Queen Mother Champion Steeple Chase in 2013 . Sprinter Sacre clears a fence on his way to winning the race two years ago . Both pack a killer punch and both are battled scarred giants. Both also hail from stables reluctant to admit the possibility of defeat. If they were boxers, they would probably be nose-to-nose, eyes bulging, refusing to be the first to blink. But underneath would be a grudging respect borne not only out of mutual ability but also shared battles against adversity. They have met once before in the Desert Orchid Chase at Kempton in December 2013. But it was a race memorable for the wrong reason as jockey Barry Geraghty pulled up Sprinter Sacre after the seventh fence with a fibrillating heart problem. It was an issue which kept him off the track until his second to Dodging Bullets at Ascot in January, a good performance off such a lengthy lay-off but one which only fuelled debate about whether the Sprinter Sacre of today is a shadow of the horse rated one of the best steeplechasers in his pomp. The delayed return had scuppered the pair\u2019s first anticipated clash in the Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown in December. Sire de Grugy, ridden by Jamie Moore, galloped to the crown at last year's Festival . But by then Sire De Grugy, who mopped up Britain\u2019s four Grade One two-mile chases in Sprinter Sacre\u2019s absence, had also been sidelined. In his case it was a hip injury which initially had Moore fearing his season might be over. But after a blip when Moore\u2019s jockey son Jamie was unseated in last month\u2019s Game Spirit Chase at Newbury, confidence was restored with a smooth winning performance at Chepstow. The debate over their relative merits and how much talent they retain has been endless but now the time for talking is over. Henderson (left), the most successful trainer in Festival history, has shown trademark patience in nursing Sprinter Sacre back into shape. He said: \u2018It will be the clash of the Festival. It is what we wanted last year and didn\u2019t happen. It will be a hell of a clash. They have got a crown that we want back. I think we have a chance. You can\u2019t be confident but I am hopeful. He is in seriously good shape and doing everything we have remotely asked him to do. Sprinter Sacre (left) finished second to Dodging Bullets in comeback at Ascot in January . Moore celebrates with\u00a0Sire de Grugy after claiming victory last year . \u2018I am not saying he is back to his very best. When he was, he was absolutely ridiculously unbeatable. It didn\u2019t matter what anyone threw at him. I am not saying he is still like that but he is in seriously good shape.\u2019 But Jamie Moore is equally bullish for Sire de Grugy. He said: \u2018I am hoping will see the same horse as last year and I am pretty sure they will. At the start of the season I thought he was working better last year. I think we will see the real Sire turn up and he will give them all a hell of race.\u2019 The danger, of course, is that all the focus on the big two leads to a talented rival being underestimated, just as when Imperial Commander gatecrashed the 2010 Gold Cup billed as the Denman versus Kauto Star show. Lining up against them is Paul Nicholls-trained Dodging Bullets, whose breeder Frankie Dettori was thinking more Derby and Royal Ascot when he sent dam Nova Cyngi to stallion Dubawi. Barry Geraghty acknowledges the crowd after being lead into the winner's enclosure in 2013 . The three-time champion Flat jockey will be at the track to watch the form horse of the season and winner of both the Tingle Creek and Clarence House Chases run. Then there is Willie Mullins-trained Champagne Fever, who was just a head away in the Arkle Trophy Chase from winning at his third consecutive Festival, 12 months ago. Nicholls also saddles much improved Mr Mole, the mount of AP McCoy. The Cheltenham Festival is rightly billed as the Olympics of Jump racing. That make the two-mile Queen Mother Champion Chase the 100metres final. Fast, furious and compelling \u2026 and almost impossible to call.","highlights":"Sprinter Scare won the\u00a0Queen Mother Champion Chase in 2013 .\nBut was not given the chance to defend his title last year due to\u00a0illness .\nSire de Grugy galloped away with the title in 2014 with comfortable win .\nThe pair go head-to-head in the race on day two of the Cheltenham Festival ."}
{"article":"Omoa, Honduras (CNN)Alexis Gonz\u00e1lez walks slowly and with some hesitation, using the outside wall of his house for balance. \"I'm getting used to the prosthesis,\" the 16-year-old says. He tries to smile, but an expression of sadness quickly returns to his face. When he was 15, Gonz\u00e1lez made a decision that would forever change his life -- to leave Omoa, an impoverished village in Honduras  -- with dreams of getting to the United States. At the end of the trek -- about 2,500 kilometers (1,500 miles) across Mexico and Guatemala -- he saw hope, school, a job and the chance to send money home. \"Sometimes we don't even have food to eat and I also wanted to get a higher education,\" Gonz\u00e1lez says. His mother was singlehandedly raising nine children, working odd jobs in restaurants and the nearby fields. They lived in a single room, an adobe house with dirt floors built on a steep and muddy hill. Chickens being raised for food roamed around the structure.  Gonz\u00e1lez says his father left the family when he was little boy. When Gonzalez left in January 2014, he didn't ask his mother for permission. He only left a letter telling her about his plans. \"I wouldn't have let him go,\" his mother Mercedes Mel\u00e9ndez says. \"When he left I went looking for him everywhere.\" She even went to Corinto on the Honduras-Guatemala border to ask authorities if they had seen him, she says. Gonz\u00e1lez says he traveled by land through Honduras and Guatemala with a teenage cousin.  They took the bus and also walked and hitch-hiked in some places. Once in Mexico, they got on the cargo train migrants call \"The Beast.\" Migrants get a risky, but free ride clinging to the outside of the train. Violent gangs sometimes board the train to rape, rob and kill migrants. Those without money to pay off the gangsters are thrown off, sometimes to their deaths in deep ravines or sharp rocks. Gonz\u00e1lez says he never faced any gangs. Things seem to be going well for him and his cousin for a while.  They had been traveling for a few days on the train and were excited at nearing the U.S.-Mexico border and crossing into the land of their dreams. But they were also tired. They ate what they could, but were unable to sleep for more than an hour at a time.  They were hanging onto the grate above the train car's couplers.  \"We used our own sweaters to tie ourselves to the train so we wouldn't fall off,\" Gonz\u00e1lez says. But tragedy was just around the corner. Somehow, he doesn't know how, he fell off the train while sleeping. He woke up bleeding profusely. \"The train had severed my right leg and part of my left heel,\" he says. He was eventually rescued by the Mexican Red Cross and taken to a hospital where he recovered for a month. He stayed at a shelter for wounded migrants for another two months. There he was fitted with a prosthesis free of charge. It's not difficult to find stories of minors in Central America who have lost limbs, been kidnapped or died while trying to travel through Mexico with the dream of migrating to the United States. Juan Armando Enamorado, a 22-year-old who lives in the coastal town of Tela, Honduras, says he almost lost his life at 17 when he jumped off the train, fleeing from gangs. \"They got on the train to steal money from people. When I heard they were coming, I jumped off the train traveling at more than 30 mph,\" he says. Enamorado says he was barely able to make it to the nearest town after walking for four days without food and very little water. Children are fleeing endemic poverty and drug violence in Central America. Last year, U.S. immigration authorities in the United States detained nearly 18,000 minors from Honduras as they were trying to cross the border without documents.  Altogether, more than 67,000 minors, mainly from Central America, were detained, according to U.S. government figures. To understand why children are fleeing in droves, CNN traveled to San Pedro Sula, Honduras.  The second largest city in the country. It has the highest reported murder rate in the world.  Violence is fueled by turf wars between two powerful gangs that control entire neighborhoods. The Honduran government is trying to change this harsh reality by deploying security forces to hotspots. Vilma Maldonado says her son was forced to leave because of death threats from gangs when he was only 15 years old.  He left La Lima, just outside San Pedro Sula, four years ago at the age of 19. The last time she heard from him he was in Monterrey, Mexico, hoping to cross into the United States. \"Sometimes I think he's dead,\" Maldonado says crying. \"But then I seek refuge in God and try to think the opposite and ask God to take these ideas out of my mind because if I'm trusting God you have to have faith that my son is still alive.\" For Monsignor R\u00f3mulo Emiliani, Auxiliary Bishop of San Pedro Sula, the migration of Central American children to the United States is a regional disgrace. \"It's something terrible, sad and shameful for us Hondurans that nearly 18,000 of our children have desperately left because of hunger and violence. It's a slap on our faces and there are people that don't care about these 18,000 children. \"Can you imagine the trip for a child who's 4, 6, 10, 12 years old all the way to the United States?  Many girls have been fondled and raped by the smugglers,\" Monsignor Emiliani says. Honduran President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez says his country has fallen victim to powerful criminal organizations fueled by drug dollars and weapons coming from the north and drugs from the south, but insists his government is working hard to stem the tide. \"We have our own responsibility.  We accept that and we're doing our work. We are pushing this forward with all that we have. Other countries are responsible for this war that we're living,\" President Hern\u00e1ndez says. Back in Omoa, Mercedes Mel\u00e9ndez, the mother of Alexis Gonz\u00e1lez, says she's deeply worried about her son. \"He has told me that he's depressed. He has recently been better, but he used to say he wanted to die.  I was getting very worried because he said that he wanted to kill himself,\" Mel\u00e9ndez says. The teenager says he now draws and writes to forget. He shows us a drawing of a family of four holding hands. He uses pastel colors and soft features in the drawing and inscribed words like \"happy,\" \"love,\" and \"I love you\" throughout. He may never be able to go to college or help his family the way he wanted. But asked if he regrets his decision to leave, he says he doesn't: the rewards were so high, it was worth the incredible risk. And for countless others like him -- from across Central America -- the same is true. And they will keep trying.","highlights":"Honduran teen tells how he lost his leg trying to get to the U.S.\nHe fell from the outside of a train rumbling through Mexico .\nIt's a trip also attempted by tens of thousands of other desperate children ."}

{"article":"So now we know. Not only can Rory McIlroy play golf better than anyone else, he can throw clubs further than anyone else as well. With perhaps the most extraordinary act of frustration we\u2019ve seen on a golf course in recent years, the Northern Irishman left no-one in any doubt as to what he thinks about his current erratic form. After a wild three iron plunged into the water at the par five 8th on Friday, the world No 1 hurled his club 60 or 70 yards into the adjacent hazard. World No 1 Rory McIlroy threw a club into the water in frustration after more erratic play on Friday . McIlroy swings and releases his club after finding the water during\u00a0the WGC-Cadillac Championship . The Northern Irishman watches as his club soars into the air and towards the lake . The 25-year-old's club makes a splash as it lands in the water on Friday afternoon . Maybe when he\u2019s finished breaking golfing records he will take up the javelin. Of course it was conduct terribly unbecoming and will lead to an inevitable fine. But the vast majority of golfers will have recognised what was going on. \u2018It was just heat of the moment stuff and not one of my proudest moments,\u2019 admitted McIlroy. \u2018I\u2019ve never done anything like that before. I probably wouldn\u2019t have done it here but I knew I didn\u2019t need a three iron for the rest of my round. So I thought: \"Yeah, why not?\u201d\u2019 His playing partner knew exactly what was going on. Henrik Stenson is a prince off the golf course but on it the Swede has broken more than his fair share of clubs in anger. \u2018It was an impressive release from Rory,\u2019 he said, smiling. \u2018You know, for a small guy he\u2019s got a strong throw and he had good speed on that one.\u2019 Worried perhaps that one or two of the American press might not get the joke, he added: \u2019Be nice to him. He\u2019s a good guy.\u2019 For those who would rather bounce up and down with righteous indignation, here\u2019s what the great American amateur Bobby Jones said almost 100 years ago: \u2018There are some emotions that simply cannot be endured with a golf club in your hands.\u2019 The game might be unrecognisable from Jones\u2019s day but in that regard it remains the same. Of more concern for McIlroy followers is what it says about his current state of mind. Under Plan A, he\u2019s only got six more competitive rounds at most to play before the Masters, when he will be trying to complete the career grand slam. Clearly, his game is not where he wants it to be but at least he\u2019s not lost his sense of humour. McIlroy takes his tee shot on the seventh hole of the second round in Florida . McIlroy missed the cut in the Honda Classic last week and struggled to an opening 73 at Doral . Asked what will he do for a three iron on Saturday, he replied: \u2018There\u2019s one on the way, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s courtesy of Nike or a scuba diving team.\u2019 The curious thing was he seemed to play better with 13 clubs than 14. This was McEnroe-esque rather than McIlroy. With the frustration no longer pent-up, he made a birdie with his second ball at the 8th, before birdieing the 10th and 12th holes. Another birdie at the 17th meant he finished with a 70 and, on one under for the event, stands on the fringes of the top ten. \u2018What\u2019s annoying me is there\u2019s no sign on the range of the sort of shot I hit on the 8th,\u2019 he said. \u2018So it\u2019s a little bit of a mental thing and a bit physical and something I need to work on.\u2019 McIlroy is eight shots off the lead held by American JB Holmes, who double-bogeyed his last hole to give everyone a break. He is now just two shots ahead of fellow American Ryan Moore, with Adam Scott lurking in third place, a further shot behind. Then come Stenson and Masters champion Bubba Watson at five adrift. Scott is not only playing his first competitive round for three months, he is also using a short putter in competition for the first time in four years. You could say it is working. So far he has had 30 putts inside 12ft\u2026.and holed 28 of them. Welshman Jamie Donaldson, runner-up in this event last year, is seven behind after a 72. Alongside McIlroy on one under is Lee Westwood, who is playing in his 50th WGC \u2013 the first man to reach that milestone since the four events to enjoy such status were conceived in 1999.","highlights":"Rory McIlroy competing in Cadillac Championship\u00a0at Trump National Doral .\nThe world No 1 got frustrated in the second round after finding the water .\nAfter losing his ball in the lake, McIlroy threw his club in too .\nThe Northern Irishman was level par for his round, and one-over in total ."}

{"article":"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN)Pakistani Armed Forces paramilitary personal stormed the headquarters of one of the country's most powerful regional opposition political parties in a predawn raid on Wednesday, seizing a stash of weapons and arresting several wanted criminals, officials said. The Rangers arrived unannounced early Wednesday morning, arrested five men and sealed off the party's headquarter for four hours. According to a press release from the MQM (Muttahida Qaumi Movement) one of their party workers was shot fatally by rangers during the raid. \"All telephone lines have been disconnected and premises ransacked. Computers and other electronic items have been confiscated. The Rangers also destroyed the electronic surveillance system that had been set up following the May 2013 bomb attacks by the Pakistan Taliban (TTP),\"  the release said. Rangers officials have not responded so far to these accusations. In a statement to the media, the Pakistan Rangers released a list of those arrested, including Faisal Mota, a former MQM worker who had been convicted and sentenced to death in absentia for the murder of journalist Wali Khan Babur.  Speaking to the media, Rangers spokesperson Col.Tahir Mahmood also confirmed that a large amount of illegal weapons had been seized during the raid. \"The weapons that we had were legal and there as a precautionary measure to deal with real threats from the Taliban against our party and its workers,\" Faisal Sabzwari, a senior MQM party leader told CNN. MQM is based in Karachi and is one of Pakistan's largest political parties. It has the second-largest contingent in the provincial assembly, with 54 of 130 seats. It styles itself as a voice for the downtrodden, the middle class and immigrants from nearby India, but political rivals accuse the party of using heavy-handed tactics, including intimidation, to stay in power. \"The raid is meant to send a clear message that law enforcement agencies and Rangers in particular are not going to bow to any political convention,\" said Zarrar Khuhro, a senior journalist and political analyst in Karachi. MQM's party leader Altaf Hussain, who has been living in self-imposed exile in London called for calm, but criticized the raid saying that \"it should not be the role of the armed forces to conduct extrajudicial operations on lawful organizations, least of all the headquarters of a democratically elected political party.\" Pakistan's Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said late Wednesday night that the raid was legal. The MQM  has the clout to shut down the city in an hour, sparking general strikes which could last for days, locals say. In the aftermath, locals say businesses in Karachi have shut down, and gas pumps and schools are closed for fear violent protests could erupt in the streets.","highlights":"Rangers arrested five men and sealed off the party's headquarter for hours .\nMQM is based in Karachi and is one of Pakistan's largest political parties .\nBusinesses, gas pumps and schools remain closed in Karachi due to raid aftermath ."}
{"article":"(CNN)I am a friendly, hard-working Ohio native. It's how a lot of my friends in New York describe Midwesterners. It's as if we're assembled at \"The Flyover Wonder Bread Factory,\" devoid of color or depth. We supposedly represent all that is wholesome in America. That may be true, but \"friendly and hard-working\" is so ... bland. If you think I'm being a tad harsh, ask anyone who isn't from the Midwest to describe someone born and raised in America's Heartland. My favorite definition came from a colleague raised in Florida. She struggled to describe us at first, then said, \"Simple.\" Um, like the Amish? \"No,\" she said, flustered. Even my fellow Midwesterners have a hard time coming up with interesting descriptors. CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos is a proud native of North Muskegon, Michigan. First thing out of his mouth, \"Friendliness!\" After that, he struggled, too. \"Boy, let me see...um...not easily agitated?\" I rolled my eyes. \"That is so bland, Danny.\" He paused, then said, \"I'll take bland over the rap Florida gets any day.\" Even my new friend, Jared Zak, from Wisconsin struggled. The best he could  come up with was \"hearty.\" I asked these questions after interviewing Eric Dayton, who wants his native Minnesota to divorce itself from the Midwest. \"We're Midwest if you're looking at it from New York City or from anywhere on [the East] Coast,\" Dayton told me. \"But then again, that's someone else's definition. I think it's time for us to claim our own.\" Dayton and his brother, Andrew, whose father is the state's governor, are Minneapolis businessmen whose clothing store and restaurant have a decidedly local flavor. Eric Dayton, after touring Scandinavia (many Minnesotans are of Norwegian descent), became enthralled by the region's strong identity. It proudly embraced its chilly weather, its food, its culture, its... Northiness. So why, he questioned, didn't Minnesota? When Dayton got home he hired a Minnesota company to make stocking hats for his clothing boutique that said, \"North.\" They sold out and Dayton's idea headed, well, north. Minnesotans just got it, he said. I admit, I didn't get it, until I thought more about it. Minnesota -- or should I say Minneapolis --  is criticized, by some of my compatriots, for being \"Minnesota nice,\" the sort of \"nice\" (fake) that isn't remotely the kind of \"nice\" (sincere) for which Midwesterners are renowned. But, hey, I have an open mind. You could argue that Minnesota, along with North Dakota, parts of Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan, are in the Northern region of the United States. And, you could argue Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia are Eastern states. The only truly Midwestern states are Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota. Go ahead, argue among yourselves, but know that Mr. Dayton isn't talking only about geography when it comes to labeling Minnesota -- \"The North.\" He's talking about image and, although he won't say it, branding. \"The New York Times had done an article highlighting different Thanksgiving side dishes,\" Dayton told me. \"For Minnesota, they named grape salad as our signature side dish. And no one in Minnesota had ever heard of grape salad... it was kind of a harmless example, but if we don't tell the rest of the country who we are, we end up with grape salad.\" That story got under my skin, especially when I looked up the NYT idea of Ohio's signature side dish: English pea and onion salad. It gets worse. The Times extolled the salad's \"deliciousness\" by saying it \"calls to mind the processed-food delights that, for decades, characterized the cooking of the Midwest.\" Seriously? The New York Times isn't solely to blame for the Midwest's image problem. Politicians are, too. Andrew Cayton is a distinguished professor of history at Miami University in Ohio. He wrote a book called \"The Identity of the American Midwest: Essays on Regional History.\" \"The Midwest,\" he told me, \"has always been a dynamic and diverse place, but that image doesn't fit with what people want to believe.\" And, by people, Cayton means politicians who routinely use the Midwest as code for a place in time that never actually existed: crime-free and populated with hard-working people who all look and worship the same. \"Arguing about the Midwest,\" Cayton says, \"has become arguing about America as a whole.\" So, listen up, campaigning politicians! Stop trying to bond with the Midwest with your bowling prowess (or lack thereof) and for goodness' sake, stop eating corn dogs at state fairs. And while I'm at it, political reporters, please stop interviewing voters in diners! I'm not maligning bowling (my dad, Tony, is in the Amateur Bowling Hall of Fame) or corn dogs, but those things don't represent the modern Midwest. It is so much more dynamic and, yes, diverse. Chicago is not like Detroit. St. Louis is not like Pittsburgh. Indianapolis is not like Columbus, or Dayton or Cleveland or Cincinnati. And, Minneapolis is not like any of them, either. Minnesota boasts 10,000 lakes and a corresponding love of cold-weather sports, such as pond hockey. Yet, I'm from Canton, Ohio, and I have never touched a hockey stick (although those other \"Northern\" states certainly have excellent puck-handling abilities). Minneapolis also has a thriving cultural community, is home to 19 Fortune 500 companies and has a cuisine all its own that is not based on processed foods. And, at the moment -- it has what many polite Midwesterners can't abide by -- attitude. You know, Minnesota nice. Definition? As my pal from Wisconsin puts it, \"sarcastic, pretentious and exclusionary.\" \"I know. Arrogant Minnesota,\" Dayton joked. \"That's what everyone thinks of when they think of Minnesota. Right? No, again, this isn't about being better. It's not a relative thing. It's just I think there are a lot of great things happening in Minnesota. It's not being recognized. I think it's important for the reasons we've discussed that there is recognition of what we have to offer. And so it's just putting forth our story. It's not trying to make it look better than it is. It's not comparing ourselves to anyone else.\" I don't know if Dayton will be successful, but I do understand why he wants Minnesota to define Minnesota. You don't attract the best and the brightest with \"friendly.\" \"There is a competition for talent,\" Dayton said. \"And it's a national competition, even an international competition.\" Maybe Ohio should join the rebranding club and become \"The East.\" 'Cause you know what? I may be friendly and hard-working, but I'm not simple. So stop asking me if I've ever gone \"cow tipping.\" Or I just might go all Minnesota on you.","highlights":"Costello: The Midwest is not 'flyover country' and has more to offer than friendliness.\nThe region need rebranding, as two guys from Minneapolis are attempting, she says ."}

{"article":"Rob Kearney has vowed that the \u2018real Ireland\u2019 will roar into Murrayfield to try and salvage a Six Nations title win on Saturday, amid continuing criticism of the performance in defeat to Wales. Ireland face a major challenge to retain the championship with England enjoying a better points difference and Wales expected to run up a big total against Italy in Rome. However, the Welsh were left fuming on Monday night after it emerged there will be no trophy to present to Sam Warburton in the Stadio Olimpico even if it transpires after the final match of the day between England and France that the Welsh are champions. Rob Kearney has vowed that the \u2018real Ireland\u2019 will try to salvage a Six Nations title win . There are two Six Nations trophies and one will be in Murrayfield, and the other in Twickenham, a planning decision that has caused anger amongst some Welsh supporters. It will require a more coherent and less error-addled performance from Ireland to defeat the Scots, and Kearney did not shirk the challenge laid down before he and his team-mates. \u2018This week will be a big test and will give a really strong insight into the group as a whole, how we react after a very disappointing defeat,\u2019 the full-back said. \u2018We\u2019ll see the real Ireland step up this week. A lot of us who underperformed last week know if we get the opportunity, [we have] to right a lot of those wrongs.\u2019 Ireland\u2019s message for the week appears to have been decided: they will say they have no interest in chasing a big points total against winless Scotland, but Kearney did intimate that at least the desire for a more attacking style is there. The impression was of players straining, impatient for their coaches to let slip the leash. Yet whether it is admitted or not, the sense in salting away as big a points difference as possible is evident given England\u2019s superior figures and the fact that they are hosting underwhelming France. Wales will also be confident of eating into the Irish and English points\u2019 advantage against Italy. \u2018I think any time you get to the last game of a championship you can go and play a bit,\u2019 said Kearney on the question of style. \u2018When I say that, it\u2019s important the wrong perception isn\u2019t picked up here and that we\u2019re going to chase this game and we\u2019re going to try and build points, because we\u2019re not,\u2019 he quickly added. VIDEO Wales dash Ireland's Grand Slam hopes - highlights . Ireland will need a more coherent and less error-addled performance to defeat Scotland . \u2018But we do know that we have to go out and give this game a right bash. It\u2019s important to get the win but how we do that will be no different to over the last three or four weeks.\u2019 The Ireland style council remain unmoved by criticisms of their game, and the claim in its aftermath that they were forced to work outside the strict instructions provided by Schmidt in chasing the match last Saturday. That explained the dislocated moves close to the Wales line, goes this argument. \u2018We have good confidence in our running game,\u2019 said Kearney. \u2018We were just getting a lot of value from our kicking game. If you launch up a ball and it travels 40 metres and you get it back, that is the equivalent of a 40-yard line break which is very hard to come by. \u2018I think the other side of that is maybe we were chasing the game a bit from early so maybe we were forced to keep the ball in hand a little bit more and try and go after the game.\u2019 They couldn\u2019t do so, but there is little expectation of significant changes being made by Schmidt for the trip to Scotland. One of the rare positives to survive the journey to Wales was the fitness of the squad. Ireland were\u00a0criticised for their poor performance in Six Nations defeat by Wales . No new casualties were sustained, and it is certain that the coach will stay largely faithful to the team that started in the Millennium Stadium. Iain Henderson was the most dynamic of the subs used against Wales and is the most probable point of discussion in team selection this week, with a start in the second row rather than the back row a possibility. There have also been calls from some for the addition of Luke Fitzgerald to the replacements\u2019 bench. Kearney admitted that when a team is changed it can sharpen the attention of everyone within the group. \u2018It keeps everyone on their toes. I think every single player has been dropped at some stage in their career. It\u2019s happened to the very best of guys. You\u2019ve got new guys coming into the team and they bring a huge amount of energy and excitement because they\u2019re finally getting their chance. \u2018The guys who performed under par realise that maybe they have been given a second chance and they really need to pull their socks up. \u2018I think when that does happen there can be some positives taken from it.\u2019","highlights":"Ireland looking to bounce back from defeat by Wales in Six Nations .\nThe Irish can still win championship by beating winless Scotland ."}

According to the Choson Sinbo, a North Korean factory sent its staff abroad in an attempt to improve its food products -- which include baguettes and sweet potato cakes. No word yet on whether they've succeeded. But it's not the first time North Korea has sent its citizens into the world to seeking culinary skills. Last April, officials from the reclusive authoritarian state traveled to the National Dairy Industry College in Franche-Comte, eastern France, in an attempt to master the art of cheese making.

{"article":"(CNN)He was proud of his son for making good grades. So Officer Robert Wilson III climbed out of his squad car in snow-bound north Philadelphia to get him a gift. While shopping for a game, he died in the line of duty. Wilson was standing at the counter across from employees at the GameStop store when two brothers, Carlton Hipps and Ramone Williams,  walked in carrying guns, police said. They allegedly stuck up the store with at least five patrons and two employees inside. \"They said they thought it was going to be an easy target,\" said police spokesman Capt. James Clark. The store is in a quiet cul-de-sac. Williams and Hipps had not seen the police car outside, where Wilson's partner Damien Stevenson sat. Nor did they notice Wilson, who was in uniform. Wilson confronted them, and a firefight broke out, police said. The officer, an eight-year veteran, stepped away from others in the store to keep them out of the crossfire, police said after watching the store's security camera footage. He was a hero and a warrior, Clark said. \"He fought until the very, very end, firing at both of them.\" Hipps and Williams ducked out of sight at times behind movie posters as they trained their fire on Wilson, Clark said. Within 30 to 40 seconds, 50 shots fell, he said. \"Officer Wilson was shot multiple times in the body and once in the head. That is the shot that ultimately killed him,\" the captain said. With Wilson down, the two men ran out of the store, where Stevenson intercepted them. The officer wounded Hipps in the leg, and Williams ran back inside the store. He stood around, trying to act like he was just another customer when they arrested him, police said. He later gave them a confession. Both brothers have been charged with Wilson's murder and with attempted murder on Stevenson. The brothers told police that it was their first robbery attempt, but it wasn't their first run-in with the law. Williams, who is 26, has been arrested twice before, and Hipps, who is 30, six times, police said. He was released from jail in 2009, Clark said. In the brothers' home, police found an AK-47. The guns used in the robbery were bought on the street, police said. They want to find out who provided them. At the GameStop, residents have started a memorial, and it's growing, CNN affiliate KYW reported. At the 22nd police district, where Wilson worked, the flag hangs at half-staff. Actor Dan Aykryod, who was in town on a promotional tour, made a donation to Wilson's family and encouraged others to do the same. Wilson was 30 years old. In addition to his son, he leaves behind a  1-year-old daughter. His son turns 10 on Monday. The game was also going to be a birthday present. CNN's Jennifer Moore and Tina Burnside contributed to this report.","highlights":"Officer Robert Wilson III was at the counter when two men allegedly stuck up a GameStop store .\nPolice: He confronted them, and a firefight broke out ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Buddy Elias spent much of his life preserving the memory of his cousin Anne Frank. His death Monday brought back memories for me. We met three years ago in an Atlanta hotel conference room. He and his wife, Gerti, were touring the United States to promote a new book. I could tell instantly that he was related to Anne. His face resembled hers so much that it felt almost as though I was meeting her in person. \"Anne Frank's Family\" had just been published, based on 14 boxes of letters, postcards, photos and documents that Gerti accidentally discovered in the attic of their house in Basel. Elias told me that it wasn't just Anne who loved to write; everyone in the family did. The 6,000 recovered documents told a story of a family torn apart by war and anti-Semitism. That day in Atlanta, I listened to Elias tell me about loved ones he lost. He told me he was lucky that his family had remained in neutral Switzerland when World War II broke out. I thought back to our conversation Thursday when I learned the news of Elias' death. He died peacefully at his home in Basel, Switzerland, at 90, said an announcement posted on the website of Anne Frank Fonds, the foundation that Elias headed. Like millions of people who read \"The Diary of Anne Frank,\" I was deeply influenced by her words and in awe of her family's courage. Anne received her diary on her 13th birthday and wrote in it for the two years that her family hid from the Nazis in the secret annex of an Amsterdam apartment. I was only in seventh grade when my father bought me the book in 1975. After the family was discovered, they were sent to Auschwitz. Later, Anne and her sister Margot were taken to Bergen-Belsen, where they both died in March 1945. Her father, Otto Frank, was the sole survivor of the family, one of only 7,000 people who made it out alive from Auschwitz. In the course of my two hours with Elias, I learned new things about the young, Jewish girl whose journal is arguably the most famous in the world. She called him Bernd, short for Bernhard, Elias' formal name. In his youth, Elias was an actor and a skater with Holiday on Ice. He was her first cousin and 4 years older. They adored one another. \"Bernd, maybe we can skate as a pair together someday,\" Anne wrote in January 1941 from Amsterdam. \"But I know I'll have to train very hard to be as good as you are.\" In another letter, Anne outlined the steps to their skating routine and drew a picture of the blue, fur-trimmed dress she would wear when she finally skated with Elias. \"She never did get to do that,\" Elias said. On his 17th birthday in 1942, she asked him how it was going with a girl he had met. It was an ordinary letter that one keeps like any other. But it turned out to be her last to him, and he preserved it like a relic, as proof of his cousin's affection, as something to treasure. \"That was the last sign of life I had with Anne,\" Elias told me. After the war, Otto Frank searched frantically for his family and eventually learned their cruel fate. He published Anne's diary in 1947 and helped transform it for the stage and film. He created the foundation in her name in 1963. The first edition of the diary was in Dutch. Elias told me he had to wait several years for a German language edition before he could read it. That was when he came to truly understand his childhood playmate. By the time he read her words, he had not seen Anne in many years. In his mind, he treasured the image of a spunky girl who loved the Jack-in-the-Box puppet shows Elias staged and played hide-and-seek. \"Anne,\" he said, \"was always good at hiding.\" I wondered whether he caught the irony of his own words. Otto Frank kept alive his daughter's legacy until he died in 1980 and passed on that role to Elias.  He was devoted to the task until the day he died. In 2012, he helped create the Frank Family Centre in Frankfurt, where archives of his extended family will be made accessible to the public, according to the Anne Frank foundation. Elias was my closest personal encounter with a girl who opened my eyes to the cruelty of this world. Anne Frank never gave up on humanity, despite everything she endured. It was her goodness that amazes every reader of her diary. In Elias, I saw that same goodness.","highlights":"Anne Frank was extremely close to her first cousin Buddy Elias .\nA discovery in Elias' attic led to the a book revealing new details about Anne's famiy .\nElias became the preserver of Anne's legacy after her father, Otto Frank, died in 1980 ."}
{"article":"Arsene Wenger was delighted as Danny Welbeck struck a second-half winner to put Arsenal in the semi-finals of the FA Cup with a 2-1 victory over his former club Manchester United, who were reduced to 10 men at Old Trafford. The Gunners took the lead midway through the first half as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain weaved his way through the United defence before teeing up Nacho Monreal to coolly slot his close-range shot past a diving David de Gea and into the bottom corner. It did not take long for the hosts to level matters and Wayne Rooney did the damage as he directed Angel di Maria's beautiful cross into the back of the net via a well-timed header.

But Welbeck handed Arsenal the lead for the second time as he beat De Gea to the ball just outside the 18-yard box and tapped into an empty net just after the hour mark. Wenger admitted he was proud of how his side executed their game plan, and told BBC 1: '(We wanted) to start without apprehension but we were caught a few times here. '(We tried) to be on the front foot from the start and close them down, play with a high pace and I felt that we did that well.' Di Maria received two bookings in quick succession as he was first shown a yellow card for diving and then was sent off after grabbing at referee Michael Oliver's shoulder in protest with just under 15 minutes left. Arsenal were drawn against Bradford or Reading in the last four and Wenger added: 'Last year we played a tricky game at Wembley in the semi-final and you expect that again. Per Mertesacker (centre) and Aaron Ramsey jump for joy after reaching the FA Cup semi-finals . Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny applauds Arsenal's 9,000 travelling supporters at Old Trafford . 'We have played Bradford before, we know about that but let's enjoy tonight. 'I feel we played a good game tonight from the start and we deserved to win the game.' Wenger was full of praise for Welbeck, who left his boyhood club for north London last summer, and provided the killer touch tonight after a blunder from Antonio Valencia. The manager said: 'I believe he is just happy to score. He worked very hard today and he was rewarded by a good goal.' The Gunners went to Old Trafford on the back of a fine run in the Barclays Premier League, with seven wins in the last eight games putting them third, now a point ahead of United and only four behind Manchester City.

Wenger continued: 'We live in the real world and we play game by game, we want to compete in every competition and I believe the result today can give us some good morale.' Welbeck appealed for a penalty as he went to ground after a touch from Marcos Rojo just inside the 18-yard box during the first half, but Oliver waved play on. Wenger said he thought it was a spot-kick, but admitted he was pleased with his side's performance despite not winning that appeal. The Frenchman added: 'We had (a shout for a penalty). I think what is the most important when you're a manager is that the team performs at a good level - and that's what we did.'","highlights":"Arsenal beat Manchester United 2-1 in the FA Cup quarter-finals .\nArsene Wenger was pleased with his side's approach at Old Trafford .\nMesut Ozil posed for a picture in the away dressing room after the game .\nDanny Welbeck netted the winning goal against his former club .\nCLICK HERE to read how all the action unfolded .\nManchester United 2-1 Arsenal: Martin Samuel's match report ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Cycling's international governing body for a long time failed to tackle widespread and well-known doping problems in the sport and gave special treatment to Lance Armstrong, according to a damning new report. The investigation by the Cycling Independent Reform Commission (CIRC) slams the way the world body -- the International Cycling Union, or UCI -- operated over a lengthy period and calls for a series of changes to its governance. The report highlights multiple instances in which top UCI officials protected, defended and made decisions favorable to Armstrong despite concerns that he was doping. Current UCI president Brian Cookson, who was elected to his post in September 2013, told CNN Monday that he had written to one of his predecessors, Dutchman Hein Verbruggen, to \"consider his position\" as the honorary president of the world governing body  in the light of the findings. Both Zerbruggen and Irishman Pat McQuaid, who Cookson unseated, both come under intense scrutiny in the report for their dealings with Armstrong. \"UCI exempted Lance Armstrong from rules, failed to target test him despite the suspicions, and publicly supported him against allegations of doping, even as late as 2012,\" it says. The UCI \"saw Lance Armstrong as the perfect choice to lead the sport's renaissance\" after a devastating doping scandal at the 1998 Tour de France, according to the report. \"The fact that he was American opened up a new continent for the sport, he had beaten cancer and the media quickly made him a global star,\" it says. But Armstrong's spectacular downfall in 2012, which saw him stripped of his Tour de France titles and dropped by sponsors, helped intensify scrutiny over how he managed to get away with doping for so long. Under Cookson, the UCI set up the independent three-person commission to investigate the causes of doping in cycling and allegations that the UCI and other governing bodies were ineffective in their responses. In one case, the commission says, the UCI limited the scope of a supposedly independent investigation into allegations that  Armstrong had tested positive in a drug test at the 1999 Tour de France. UCI officials and Armstrong's team became heavily involved in the drafting of the investigation's report, which was released in 2006. \"The main goal was to ensure that the report reflected UCI's and Lance Armstrong's personal conclusions,\" the commission says. \"The significant participation of UCI and Armstrong's team was never publicly acknowledged.\" Between 1992 and 2006, UCI's top officials focused on protecting cycling's reputation rather than trying to root out \"endemic\" doping practices of which they were well aware, the commission's report says. \"Not only did UCI leadership publicly disregard the magnitude of the problem, but the policies put in place to combat doping were inadequate,\" it says. The report highlights McQuaid's decision to allow Armstrong to participate in the 2009 Tour Down Under even though the cyclist hadn't been in the testing group for the required period of time. The commission says although there is no direct evidence of an agreement between McQuaid and Armstrong, McQuaid \"made a sudden U-turn and allowed Lance Armstrong to return 13 days early\" to take part in the competition, \"despite advice from UCI staff not to make an exception.\" \"There was a temporal link between this decision, which was communicated to UCI staff in the morning, and the decision of Lance Armstrong, which was notified to Pat McQuaid later that same day, to participate in the Tour of Ireland, an event run by people known to Pat McQuaid,\" the report says. The report says the commission found no evidence to support allegations of corruption over payments made to the UCI by Armstrong. But it adds that \"requesting and accepting donations from Lance Armstrong, given the suspicions, left UCI open to criticism.\" CNN wasn't immediately able to reach McQuaid, but Verbruggen issued a lengthy statement Monday, claiming \"wild conspiracy theories and accusations have been properly debunked once and for all.\" He said: \"I have studied the CIRC report and I am satisfied that it confirms what I have always said: that there have never been any cover-ups, complicity or corruption in the Lance Armstrong case or, indeed, in any other doping cases.\" Armstrong, who cooperated with the commission's investigation, thanked it for \"seeking the truth and allowing me to assist in that search.\" \"I am deeply sorry for many things I have done. However, it is my hope that revealing the truth will lead to a bright, dope-free future for the sport I love,\" he said in a statement. \"In the rush to vilify Lance, many of the other equally culpable participants have been allowed to escape scrutiny, much less sanction, and many of the anti-doping 'enforcers' have chosen to grandstand at Lance's expense rather than truly search for the truth,\" said Armstrong's attorney, Elliot Peters. The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, USADA, which banned Armstrong from cycling for life in 2012, welcomed the commission's work. \"The report confirms that, for more than a decade, UCI leaders treated riders and teams unequally -- allowing some to be above the rules,\" said USADA Chief Executive Travis T. Tygart. \"The UCI's favoritism and intentional failure to enforce the anti-doping rules offends the principles of fair play and is contrary to the values on which true sport is based.\" Cookson told CNN that the world governing body would be stepping up its fight against drugs cheats, working closely with the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA), national federations and, if necessary, law enforcement agencies. But the 63-year-old Briton still believes cycling has taken strides forward in the fight against drugs cheats. \"Large numbers of riders are competing without doping,\" he said. \"I want to encourage them and support them. I think it's possible to compete successfully in our sport without doping.\" However, Cookson reacted angrily to other aspects of the report, which suggested amateur cyclists and junior competitors were involved in doping. Of older cyclists, competing in Masters categories, Cookson gave a damning verdict. \"The only people they are fooling is themselves, they are deluded,\" he said. But his harshest words were reserved over allegations that drugs were being peddled to young cyclists. \"The people involved should be subjected to criminal proceedings because that's child abuse. I'm astonished and appalled by those findings,\" he said. CNN's Kevin Dotson and Paul Gittings contributed to this report.","highlights":"Report: Cycling officials protected and defended Armstrong despite doping concerns .\nThey exempted him from rules and failed to target test him, commission says .\nArmstrong cooperated with the investigation and thanks it for \"seeking the truth\"\nNEW: UCI honorary president asked to 'consider his position' by current chief Brian Cookson ."}
{"article":"Just for a moment, when he gained a thin edge to an attempted pull off Pakistan' s Sohail Khan in Auckland, it was possible to believe that Abraham Benjamin de Villiers was human after all. All other evidence suggests the South African known as AB is some kind of super power, a man so talented in so many sports that cricket was blessed when he decided to make taking one-day batting to another, exalted level his destiny. Nothing sums up England's out-dated methods at this otherwise expansive World Cup than to watch the extraordinary De Villiers going about his work. South African captain AB De Villiers leaves the field during the  Cricket World Cup match against Pakistan . Joe Root  leaves the field after being dismissed by Rangana Herath of Sri Lanka during the World Cup match . Okay, perhaps it is unfair to criticise them for not living up to a genius who has defied belief with the most spectacular batting in cricket history but De Villiers has become the benchmark now for everyone else to attempt to emulate. We are lucky he is a cricketer at all. De Villiers grew up in Pretoria playing hockey, football, rugby, tennis and badminton to international standard at age-group level while also being an accomplished sprinter and swimmer. These days, in his spare time, he plays golf off scratch on top of being an all-round cricketer who keeps wicket, bowls and fields to a high level for his country as well as indisputably the best limited-overs batsman in the world. Give him the throne of Albania and he would surpass even the legendary CB Fry. Mitch Marsh celebrates after taking the wicket of Eoin Morgan during the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup match . De Villiers  looks on after the dismissal of teammate Rilee Rossouw  during the match at Eden Park . And those who have suggested the current England team may be a bit too nice to succeed in this tournament might like to note that it is hard to find anyone with a bad word to say about De Villiers. Perhaps the suggestion of a receding hair-line, at the age of 31, is his only nod towards mortality. De Villiers has been around for 10 years now at the highest level but it is with two particular innings in the last two months that he has breathed life into the 50-over format and re-written the rules on what can be possible. First, against the West Indies in Johannesburg in January, De Villiers reached three figures in just 31 balls, going from nought to a hundred in 40 minutes and smashing 16 sixes, the same number as India's Rohit Sharma during his record-breaking 264 against Sri Lanka. A dejected Morgan looks on during England's game against Sri Lanka in Wellington, New Zealand . De Villiers talks to teammate Francois du Plessis  during the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup match . Then, in this World Cup, he demolished the poor, hapless West Indians again with an extraordinary unbeaten 162, racing from a hundred to 150 in just 12 balls. De Villiers now holds the records for the fastest 50, 100 and 150 in one-day international history. South Africa, at one stage looking set for a total of around 270, instead made the small matter of 408 for five. Extraordinary. De Villiers does not look particularly powerful, as Chris Gayle does, nor stocky and pugnacious like David Warner and Aaron Finch. There is plenty that is orthodox about his methods but also an incredible ability to hit full-length balls outside of off-stump to the leg-side for six. When he is in full flow he is a joy to behold and for a while, against Pakistan on Saturday, he looked capable of winning the match on his own until that thin edge saw his side consigned to defeat. South Africa are a notoriously fragile tournament team but in their captain they have a man capable of taking them all the way to the final. Root leaves the field after being dismissed during the World Cup match between England and Sri Lanka a . Younis Khan talks to AB de Villiers  during the  Cricket World Cup match between South Africa and Pakistan . The lesson for England to absorb is that the pioneers of this new impossible is nothing brand of one-day cricket are basically playing Twenty20 over 50 overs. Even now, while all evidence points to a different approach, they still prefer to treat a one-day international as a shortened Test innings. They do have the players capable of doing it the modern way, that's the frustration of England's World Cup so far. None more so than Jos Buttler, whose eyes positively lit up when asked if the World Cup had been exciting him. 'Definitely,' said Buttler. 'AB de Villiers is I someone I look at who has played some amazing knocks. Cricket's changed. The introduction of the IPL and Twenty20, people are coming up with things and the hitting at the end is nothing short of spectacular. England coach Peter Moores looks on during the  Cricket World Cup match between England and Sri Lanka . Dale Steyn celebrates with De Villiers  and the team after taking a catch to dismiss Ahmad Shahzad of Pakistan . 'As a fan of cricket you watch these guys perform at the top of their profession and you take a step back and enjoy it. De Villiers has been fantastic to watch. Brendon McCullum faced two guys who were bowling at 90 miles per hour (against Australia) and was swinging even harder. There's been some great moments as a fan to sit and watch and enjoy.' Sadly not many of them have involved England but what comes next is clear, whether they scrape into the knockout stages or not. England simply have to rip it up and start again in one-day cricket and build a new side around the likes of Buttler, Joe Root, Moeen Ali and those coming through like Jason Roy and Sam Billings. De Villiers has shown what is possible. Now England have to play catch up. And fast. Steyn celebrates the wicket of Misbah-ul-Haq of Pakistan with AB de Villiers and Farhaan Behardien .","highlights":"Evidence suggests AB de Villiers is some kind of super power .\nA man so talented in so many sports that cricket was blessed to be chosen .\nHe has become the benchmark now for everyone else to attempt to emulate .\nSouth African De Villiers has taken one-day batting to another, exalted level ."}

Twenty-three people, most of them tourists, were killed after gunmen opened fire inside the Bardo Museum, a stone's throw from the parliament building. The \"I will come to Tunisia\" social media campaign is aimed at protecting the North African nation's tourism industry -- which is critical to the country's economy. The social media campaign features users holding up signs saying they will travel to the North African country. \"I will travel to Tunisia this summer,\" reads a sign held up by a girl from China.

I will visit Tunisia and celebrate your Independence Day.\" Tens of thousands of people online have expressed support and solidarity with #JeSuisBardo (\"I am Bardo\"), #JeSuisTunisien (\"I am Tunisian\"), and #PrayForTunisia trending on Twitter. Some one in five Tunisians rely on tourism for their living, the nation's tourism minister said in 2013. Travel warnings in place in the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries could cripple Tunisia's economy. It's a fresh wound after a painful few years in the birthplace of the Arab Spring. Visits to the country dropped significantly after the unrest of the 2010-2011 Jasmine Revolution, but the numbers had been bouncing back before the museum attack.

{"article":"(CNN)One is a former high school cornerback who also loves baseball. The other is a football  fan who also played competitive golf. The two University of Oklahoma students at the center of a racist fraternity video have more than sports in common. They're both under fire since the nine-second clip showed them making racial slurs against blacks. In it, students at the now-disbanded Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity clap, pump their fists and laugh as they hurl racial slurs and make a reference to lynching. School officials have expelled Parker Rice and Levi Pettit because of their alleged \"leadership role\" in the racist chant. Here's what we know about the two students: . Rice, 19,  was raised in Dallas, where he recently graduated  from Jesuit College Preparatory School. In high school, he was an avid sportsman, and he played cornerback on the football team, in addition to baseball, The Dallas Morning News reported. His father, Bob Rice, is a real estate agent in Dallas, where he volunteers for various organizations, including a baseball league and the local YMCA, according to the newspaper. Earlier this year, a sibling of the younger Rice described their close relationship in an interview with their high school newspaper. In the article, the brother says they enjoy playing video games and watching movies together. Rice has apologized for the video, calling his actions wrong and reckless. \"I made a horrible mistake by joining into the singing and encouraging others to do the same,\" he said in a statement Tuesday. His family has fled their home, where protesters gathered Wednesday. They've also wiped out their social media accounts. As the university tries to heal after days of controversy, some are rallying to Rice's defense. Matthew Lopez,  a friend and fellow student at the university, said the video is not a reflection of who he is. \"That video does not represent his core personality,\" Lopez said. \"Unfortunately though, as things are, that might define him for a while. But it does not define him personally, I feel.\" Lopez described him as a \"charismatic, good person, with a good soul and a good spirit\" who experienced a lapse in judgment. \"His behavior is a result of his influence of the fraternity system and the traditions that have been embedded since pre-civil war times, when the fraternity was made, which obviously weren't the most tolerant times,\" Lopez said. The second student expelled, Pettit does not have much of a digital footprint. What appears to be his now deleted Twitter page mainly focuses on his musings about college football. Pettit played golf at his alma mater, Highland Park High School, The Dallas Morning News reported. In a statement, his parents said their son made a horrible mistake and apologized to African-Americans, students and university faculty. \"He is a good boy, but what we saw in those videos is disgusting,\" Brody and Susan Pettit said. \"While it may be difficult for those who only know Levi from the video to understand, we know his heart, and he is not a racist.\" CNN has reached out to both students but has not heard back from Rice.

Jonny Evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the floored Newcastle United striker . Papiss Cisse subsequently retaliates, and appears to aim spit of his own back at the Manchester United man . Evans (left) and Cisse clash near the half-way line at St James' Park following the unpleasant exchange . Everton (a), March 15 . Arsenal (h), March 21 . Sunderland (a), April 5 . Liverpool (a), April 13 . Tottenham (h), April 19 . Swansea (h), April 25 . Leicester (a), May 2 . Both Newcastle striker Cisse, who admitted the charge, and Evans released statements on Thursday in which they disagreed on the intent behind the disgusting scenes. Bizarrely, Evans claimed he was shocked by the allegations and protested his innocence. Cisse responded by apologising but said he was provoked when Evans spat at him. Indeed, Sportsmail understands that Cisse is furious that the Northern Ireland international has not admitted his guilt, and is adamant the defender spat at his leg. And Cisse will inform FA disciplinary chiefs that Evans intentionally spat at him when questioned about the incident. Cisse has been banned for seven games after accepting the charge from the FA on Thursday . This season, FA guidelines  dictate that the punishment for spitting should be in line with FIFA's six game ban for the offence. Cisse faces an additional one game ban because he has already been sent off for violent conduct after elbowing Everton's Seamus Coleman (above) in December. Having conceded he was wrong to react by spitting in Evans\u2019s face, Cisse will be fined a week\u2019s wages of around \u00a340,000 by Newcastle, who will now be without their 11-goal top scorer until May. FA rules were changed in the summer to bring them in line with FIFA guidelines which state a player found guilty of spitting at an opponent will be suspended for six games. However, Cisse has already served a three-match ban for violent conduct this season after elbowing Everton\u2019s Seamus Coleman and as a result will be hit with an additional one-game suspension. He will not return until the final three matches of the campaign. Evans, meanwhile, could miss crucial Premier League fixtures against Spurs, Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea should he be found guilty. But the 27-year-old will contest the charge, to which he must respond by 6pm on Friday evening. The Senegalese striker points the finger at United defender Evans after the ugly incident . Newcastle managing director Lee Charnley said: 'Both ourselves and Papiss agree that this kind of behaviour is not acceptable. 'In life, when you do something wrong you have to front up, admit your mistakes and accept the punishment. Papiss was proactive this morning in making a full and heartfelt apology, which he did in advance of any notification from the FA regarding this charge. 'This was something he felt strongly about and we fully support him in quickly accepting the charge. 'Papiss is known to many of our region's schools, community groups and junior football teams for his involvement in the work of the Newcastle United Foundation. 'He has this evening expressed to us his strong desire to engage in additional community activities during the period of his ban. 'He is particularly keen to use his position as a role model to encourage young and influential fans to engage in sport and learn lessons about the importance of fair play and personal conduct.' Evans\u2019s statement read: \u2018Having woken up this morning I am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night\u2019s match. I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse. \u2018I was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor. \u2018During the game Papiss Cisse and I spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that I was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting. \u2018It is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something I have ever done or would ever do. It is certainly not something that I did last night.\u2019 Tempers threaten to boil over as team-mates from Newcastle and United gather on the pitch . Cisse was banned for an extra man after beinf sent off for elbowing Everton's Seamus Coleman in December . The FA were waiting for referee Anthony Taylor's report. As he missed the incident between Jonny Evans and Pappis Cisse, and it wasn't included in his report -  the FA were within their right to retrospectively punish the pair. Hull striker George Boyd was banned for three games last season after being found guilty of spitting at Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart. However, the FA have issued new guidelines to move in line with new FIFA guidelines meaning Evans and Cisse could now be banned for six games. Cisse responded less than an hour later by saying: \u2018I have apologies to make to a lot of people today. Firstly to my team-mates and to our supporters, secondly to Jonny Evans, and thirdly to every football fan who saw the incident between myself and Jonny. \u2018I reacted to something I found very unpleasant. Sometimes it is hard not to react, particularly in the heat of the moment. I have always tried hard to be a positive role model, especially for our young fans, and yesterday I let you down. \u2018I hope children out there playing football for their clubs and schools this weekend will know better than to retaliate when they are angry. Perhaps when they see the problem it now causes me and my team they will be able to learn from my mistake, not copy it.\u2019","highlights":"Jonny Evans appeared to spit at Papiss Cisse on Wednesday night .\nStriker Cisse retaliated by aiming spit back at defender Evans .\nToon striker handed seven-game ban from  after accepting the FA charge .\nEvans has until 6pm Friday to respond to the same charge .\nReferee Anthony Taylor missed the incident and neither player was booked .\nEvans denied spitting at Cisse, whilst the Newcastle striker has apologised .\nManchester United won the game 1-0 thanks to Ashley Young's late goal .\nREAD: Van Gaal defends Jonny Evans after spitting incident ."}
{"article":"If you were wondering what the prototype of a Louis van Gaal player is you need not do so any longer. It is Ashley Young. The versatile winger-turned-wing-back, who netted the winner in United's 1-0 victory at Newcastle United on Wednesday, is the Dutchman's kind of guy. 'He is a player who wants to perform what you say,' Van Gaal told MUTV. 'I think he fits good in my profile.' Ashley Young celebrates his goal against Newcastle United, and he is a favourite of manager Louis van Gaal . Young sprints towards the Manchester United support at St James' Park after scoring in the 89th minute . Manager Van Gaal has been frequently picking Young, and United have lost just once with him in the side . So there you have it. Not Wayne Rooney, not Robin van Persie, not even \u00a360million man Angel Di Maria. Ashley Young. The news may not go down well with legions of United fans who have spent the best part of a season doing their best Alan Turing impressions and trying to decipher Van Gaal's fabled philosophy. That Young, who has often flattered to deceive, is a cornerstone of Van Gaal's style may puzzle even further. The statistics, however, tell a different story. Aside from defeat in their home opener against Swansea, United have not lost with Young in the side. At St James' Park, albeit from a chance laid on a plate, he scored United's late winner for all three points . In the 17 matches he has been involved in since they have won 11 and drawn six. At St James' Park, albeit from a chance laid on a plate by the generous hosts, he scored United's first late winner since Boxing Day 2012. Under Van Gaal, Young appears to have recreated himself. His form at both wing-back and in his traditional slot further up the field is expected to win him a new contract and the Dutchman heaped further praise on the former Aston Villa man. 'We have played also with wing-backs and I think that is his best position,' said Van Gaal. 'Now I use him as a winger and he does a very good job. I am pleased with him.' This season has seen Young as a regular at Old Trafford, playing both on the wing and at wing back . Personality-wise, Young is also a good fit for Van Gaal. He is known as one of the most down-to-earth players at the club and in 2013 responded to an appeal on behalf of a terminally ill United fan to fulfil his wish of seeing his beloved Reds for the final time by handing over his box at Old Trafford. Such gestures are not lost on Van Gaal, who regularly encourages his men to engage with fans. Meanwhile, Jonny Evans is considering entering a not guilty plea after the FA charged him with spitting at Newcastle's Papiss Cisse, who has already accepted the same charge. The Northern Ireland man maintains that he spat at the floor, not at Cisse, and the club are set to give him their backing. He has until 6pm to respond to the charge. Young prepares to fire in a shot against Sunderland last weekend as United chased a top four place .","highlights":"Manager Louis van Gaal says Ashley Young 'fits good in my profile'\nHis personality and hard-working nature are appealing for Van Gaal .\nThe former Aston Villa winger scored the winner against Newcastle United .\nManchester United have lost only once this season when playing Young .\nJonny Evans is considering entering a not guilty plea for his FA charge .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Manchester United news ."}
{"article":"(CNN)For those who hoped that the coming presidential election would usher in the dawn of a new, more inspiring politics, this past week has been deeply discouraging. In two key moments, leaders from both sides of the aisle have acted like the Bourbons of France, who famously remembered nothing and forgot nothing from battles of their past. The first and substantively more important moment was the sending of that letter by Republican senators to the Iranian regime. The second, and perhaps more important politically telling moment, was Hillary Clinton's handling of her emails. The two cases are oddly related. In both instances, the principals started with legitimate concerns but have wound up making things worse. In both cases, the principals have also created divisive issues that will deepen polarization through the campaign and probably into the next presidency. Both have diminished the chances for breaking out of today's ugly politics. Republicans in Congress have reason to press hard with their views as negotiations with Iran enter the home stretch. They, like many others -- including a sizable number of Democrats, the current Israeli government, and friendly Arab nations -- fear the Obama administration will cut a weak, leaky deal that will allow Iran to come perilously close to having nuclear weapons. Just as importantly, Republicans believe, with cause, that as he negotiates, President Barack Obama has tried to sideline Congress in general and them in particular. Who can blame them for arguing that if the President insists any agreement needs only executive approval -- not approval by Congress -- then the next chief executive should not be legally bound by its provisions? Their basic concerns were not unreasonable. Thus, if they had sent exactly the same letter to the President, they would have caused a stir but would have been seen as within the norms of politics and statecraft. Instead, they made the mistake -- a wicked one -- of sending it to the terrorist leaders of Iran, leaving a clear impression they were out to sabotage both the deal and the President. We have had renegade members of Congress try to interfere with presidential negotiations in the past -- remember Sen. Jesse Helms? -- but never 47 members of the United States Senate tossing a hand grenade into delicate, life-or-death negotiations conducted by seven major nations and led by the United States. Ayatollah Khamenei made clear this week that he may use the Republican letter as a pretext for rejecting any deal. Where do we go then? Will talks collapse? Will an Iranian rush toward the bomb set off a nuclear arms race, starting in Saudi Arabia, which is already taking preliminary steps? Will the United States then be compelled to use military force against Iran? Who knows for sure? What we do know is that Iran is now almost certain to become a central issue in the 2016 presidential campaign and that the Republican nominee will be under relentless pressure from the right to adopt a hard, unyielding line. One can just imagine a number of GOP candidates pledging that if elected, they will abolish Obamacare on Day 1 and an Iranian agreement on Day 2. This is hardly a way to restore steady, bipartisan foreign policies, as we so badly need. And why have Republicans forgotten so soon the damage done from voters thinking the last GOP president was too hard line and reckless? On the other side of the aisle, Hillary Clinton had absolutely legitimate concerns about the security of emails she might send as secretary of state. As one who spent a year and a half at the Clinton White House and State Department, I could see first hand how they -- more than any president since Nixon -- were hounded by enemies and reporters trying to ferret out secrets to cause trouble or win a prize. It is small wonder that both Clintons still have scar tissue. Hillary Clinton's mistakes did not start with creating an email protection system. No, they started when she and her team failed to coordinate up front with the State Department system and record all official exchanges within the government system on a prompt, air-tight basis. That did not break laws. But it did run afoul of government procedures and, when revealed, naturally gave rise to suspicions about what she might be hiding. In her press conference, she did accomplish her obvious mission: she began cutting legs off the story. In essence, she said one half of her emails (the official ones) are now safely with the State Department and, at her request, will gradually be made public. The other half (who knows what's in there?) have been deleted and she is keeping the server. In effect, she says, they are gone ... and gone forever, beyond Congressional subpoena, FOIA requests, and even hackers. What fresh revelations can the press now pursue? Not many. And how can Republicans browbeat her in hearings without looking like bullies? Hard to do. In short, the story may soon die. You just have to trust me, she says. Clever. But the very fact that instead of inviting a neutral, trusted party like Lee Hamilton to review all the emails, she chose to cut off the story by destroying the evidence comes with a price: she has freshly renewed public doubts whether she plays straight or by her own rules. Loyal Democrats will continue to invest their faith in her, but for many others, the controversy leaves a lingering sense of unease. And polarization deepens. She was always going to face a rough campaign, but now she will begin with clouds already gathering. More to the point, they will obscure her very real strengths as a leader. Around the world, many women look upon her with heartfelt admiration from her years of promoting their empowerment. And she has also has a strong case to make that she and her husband know something about job creation: 22.9 million were created in the eight Clinton years, more than in any other presidency since World War II (Reagan was second at 16.1 million; there have been some 6.4 million in the first six Obama years.). In short, she is worse off than she was before this controversy broke -- and so are American politics. Bill Clinton likes to say that politics is always about tomorrow -- and he is right. But candidates also need to remember and learn from yesterday. After this last week, they might start by reading a wonderful book by historian Barbara Tuchman published some 30 years ago: \"The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam.\" There she argues that leaders often start out trying to do the right thing but take a wrong path, stubbornly stick with it despite all evidence and eventually wreck. Tuchman calls their refusal to learn from experience \"wooden-headedness\". We have seen too much wooden-headedness these past days.","highlights":"David Gergen: Iran almost certain to become big issue in 2016 campaign .\nClinton's mistakes did not start with creating email protection system, he says ."}
{"article":"Bradford boss Phil Parkinson is relishing his side's return to the role of FA Cup outsiders after watching them keep their Wembley hopes alive with a gutsy goalless draw against Reading at Valley Parade. The Bantams' recent knockout heroics had made them narrow favourites to book their place in the semi-finals for the first time since 1911 despite the face they faced higher league opposition. But after watching Gary Liddle come closest in a clattering clash when he hit the woodwork late in the first half, Parkinson was keen to revive the siege mentality which helped them to wins over Chelsea and Sunderland. Phil Parkinson is congratulated by Jose Mourinho as Bradford shocked Chelsea at Stamford Bridge . Parkinson the manager  collides with Garath McCleary of Reading during the FA Cup Quarter Final match . Parkinson said: 'We will go down there for the replay really as the underdogs and we will approach it in a positive fashion because we're at our best when we do that. 'We won at Stamford Bridge which was seen as a day out for us because no-one expected us to go and get a result. So we are still very much alive and kicking.' The draw will mean a rare return for Parkinson to the club for whom he made 361 appearances and as a player and was voted their best ever central midfielder in an online poll. Andrew Davies  heads the ball wide of the Reading goal during the FA Cup Quarter Final match at Valley Parade . 'I'm looking forward to going back there because I haven't got down there many times since I left,' added Parkinson. 'Obviously I would have preferred to have gone through but the next best scenario is the replay.' Pavel Pogrebnyak and Oliver Norwood also hit the post for Reading who were bidding to make their own bit of history by reaching the last four for the first time since 1927. And Steve Clarke's men know they will probably never have a better chance than their replay against League One opposition which is scheduled for a week on Monday at the Madejski Stadium. Pavel Pogrebnyak heads the ball onto the post during the FA Cup Quarter Final match . Clarke had plainly set his side up to combat the physical nature of the Bantams who had stunned Sunderland in the fifth round and taken the lead inside the first four minutes. And the tone for a full-throttle but low-quality encounter was set in a robust opening minute as Billy Knott barged over Jamie Mackie and moments later Nathaniel Chalobah's challenge left James Hanson stretched out on the deck. The bruising encounter continued in the same vein from the first whistle to the last with Reading captain Alex Pearce playing the last three minutes with a broken nose after an accidental clash with Bradford substitute Francois Zoko. Stephen Darby applauds the fans following their team's 0-0 draw during match between Bradford and Reading . Bradford had stepped up the pace in the second half with chances for Hanson and Andrew Davies but it was Reading who came closest to snatching it when Norwood's late free-kick caused a mighty scramble in the home box. Clarke said he hoped the replay would attract a sell-out crowd at the Madejski Stadium but rejected his side's role as favourites and stressed the Bantams were still very much in the hunt for a semi-final place. Billy Knott strikes the ball as Daniel Williams of Reading closes in during the FA Cup Quarter Final match . 'We are both still in the hat and can look forward to the draw, and both teams will fancy their chances in the replay,' said Clarke. 'We hit the post twice and on another day we could have nicked it but it's probably a fair result and now we will look forward to them coming back to our place. 'I knew we were in the game from the first minute from the way we were challenging and getting the second balls. I knew we were determined to get them back to our place if that was the best we could do, and everyone was 100 per cent concentrated on that.' Jon Stead of Bradford City reacts after seeing a goalscoring chance missed during the FA Cup Quarter Final .","highlights":"Phil Parkinson is relishing his side's return to the role of FA Cup underdog .\nBradford kept their Wembley hopes alive with a gutsy goalless draw .\nThey were favourites to reach semi finals for the first time since 1911 .\nParkinson is keen to revive mentality which helped them beat Chelsea ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Once again the global community waits to see if the United States and its partners can really halt Iran's quest for nuclear power through a verifiable accord or if Tehran is trying to buy more time for a clandestine nuclear weapons program it is suspected of having. True, the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has consistently denied it seeks anything more than nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. But Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's repeated claims in public forums that \"We do not have nuclear weapons, and we do not intend to produce them,\" have failed to convince the United States, European Union and Israel. Suspicion is well-warranted.  Iran reluctantly disclosed to the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA \u2014 only after U.S.-led detection \u2014 its clandestine enrichment of uranium at an underground facility near Qum, testing of bridge wires to explode the detonators of atom bombs at the Parchin military facility near Tehran, and development of an advanced multipoint trigger system for nuclear warheads. Even the IAEA director noted on March 2 that the agency still could not \"provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities.\" As a result, the chief ayatollah's words seem more intended for defusing the international storm rather than changing domestic policy. Moreover, Khamenei has made it amply clear to Iran's citizens in the text of an infographic on his website, also reproduced by the state-controlled news media, that \"Iran must not cease or slow down\" but should \"continue nuclear research, expansion, and progress.\" He has threatened as well, repeatedly, that Iran will unleash a \"crushing response\" against any nation with which it clashes, making his stated intent to continue nuclear activities more ominous. However, economically strapped and internationally isolated, Iran's citizens are putting pronounced pressure on President Hassan Rouhani and Khamenei. A November 2014 Gallup Poll indicates 70% of Iranians hope their leaders will accept an agreement. They expect the country's economy will jump-start through reduction or elimination of sanctions. So Iranian politicians and clerics, even those on the National Security and Foreign Policy Parliamentary Committee, have gradually begun acknowledging that sooner or later \"some sort of a result [i.e., nuclear deal]\" will have to be accepted by Tehran. Ordinary Iranians' desire to reach a pact with the West is understandable. Iran's economy ranks only 32nd  in the world, according to data from the World Bank, despite its vast energy resources and well-educated public. Consequently its people's prosperity has fallen to a lowly 107th among the world's societies, according to the Legatum Institute. Plunging oil prices have recently added to domestic woes, with that country facing deeper deficit in revenues much needed for development projects. Iranian leaders realize their regime remains vulnerable not only to externally imposed sanctions, but more so to internally generated widespread discontent, which erupted and was violently repressed in 2009. Regime preservation has multiple facets, however. It's not just about keeping citizens fiscally happy. Nuclear weapons work well in deterring external adversaries. Processing such technology generates much pride at home, too. Fifty-six percent of Iranians responded favorably to its continued development when polled in January. Consequently there will be countervailing internal pressure on Iran's leaders to withstand fully meeting obligations under the Nonproliferation Treaty, irrespective of whether a deal is reached, even if the socioeconomic cost to their citizens and fever-pitch global consternation continue to rise. But Iran's leaders also know full well that agreeing to a pact that lifts most or all sanctions will boost the economy and thereby generate additional resources to enhance the regime's popularity at home and influence abroad. This central goal of Iran's presence at the negotiating table was made crystal clear during the Supreme Leader's Nav Roz, or New Year, public address on March 21: \"Removal of sanctions is part of the subject of negotiations, not of the results ... removal of sanctions should occur without any deal when an agreement is reached.\" \"We can see a path forward here to get to an agreement ... [and] very much believe we can get this done by [the deadline of] March 31,\" stressed a senior State Department official traveling with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to Lausanne on March 25. Negotiators have even added three more months to resolve the technical details of the overall agreement. Diplomacy may, as the Obama administration has stressed repeatedly, indeed be the most efficient and least dangerous way to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Certainly neither the American nor the European publics want another drawn-out war in the Middle East. But as the United States and other world powers work fervently toward clinching the long-awaited nuclear agreement with the Islamic republic, it is important for Western negotiators and politicians to bear two central considerations in mind: (1) Irrespective of mechanisms written into the deal, will verification actually be possible on the ground to ensure Iran both limits and becomes fully transparent about its nuclear program? (2) Would the world collectively or the United States independently be able to enforce punitive actions, such as re-establishing sanctions, if Iran fails to comply fully and in a timely manner? Iran's President continues to suggest that his country seeks a \"win-win deal which would serve the interests of all the parties,\" as does his negotiating team. But many Western and Middle Eastern leaders fear the United States and its allies will not be able to truly enforce nuclear limits upon Iran through any treaty. Certainly not only many Asian and African nations, but even two of the superpowers, Russia and China, see little if any threat from Tehran and would much prefer to reopen large-scale trade with Iranians than argue about atomic fission. Last November, Russia even entered into an agreement to build at least two nuclear reactors in Iran. Once sanctions are lifted, multinational corporations will likely invest heavily in Iran and resist having to pull out subsequently. Not surprisingly, influential hard-line Iranian leaders including Ayatollah Sadegh Larijani, who heads Iran's judiciary, trumpet: \"Our country and our negotiating officials ... are the real winners in these talks.\" Four years ago Iran's Revolutionary Guards declared: \"The day after Iran's first nuclear test is a normal day ... but for some of us there will be a new sparkle in our eyes.\" Even if a deal is done, will Iran gamble that with the exception of the United States and Israel, nations can come to live with it eventually reaching the threshold of nuclear breakout or wielding nuclear weapons?","highlights":"Authors: Iran's people want a deal in hopes of a better economy .\nThey say Iran's leaders recognize that having a nuclear program can elevate its international clout ."}
{"article":"Moscow (CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared in public Monday for the first time in about 10 days as he met with Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev in the Russian city of St. Petersburg. Putin isn't generally one to shy away from the limelight -- posing with a (tranquilized) tiger, riding a horse while shirtless, earning a karate black belt. So his unexplained absence fueled speculation about his health, grip on power and even his love life. Although the Kremlin and the Russian state media released photos and video footage of Putin last week, they did not quell the rumors about his whereabouts, because it was unclear when they were taken. So all eyes were turned to St. Petersburg on Monday for Putin's scheduled meeting with Atambayev of Kyrgyzstan. His appearance before the press, looking healthy and relaxed, should help put some of the rumors at least to rest. And he made light of his absence, saying: \"It would be boring without gossip.\" In another sign Putin has a firm hand on the tiller, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said the President had ordered Russia's Northern Fleet to be placed on full combat alert from Monday morning for snap checks, Russia's state-run Tass news agency reported. The checks are intended to test the fleet's capacity to ensure Russia's military security in the Arctic, Tass said. Also on alert are Russia's Western Military District and certain airborne units, with some 38,000 military personnel involved in total. Here's what gave some doubters grist for the rumor mill: On Friday --  three days before the scheduled meeting --  a Russian state media broadcaster prematurely aired a report that Putin had a meeting with Atambayev -- although the event had not yet occurred. The station acknowledged the error, but it only heightened the speculation over Putin and his whereabouts. Social media has been swirling with questions, with hashtags such as #Putindead and #putinmissing. Was he ill? Was he holed away somewhere with his girlfriend and a new baby, as some in the European media speculated? There were even dark rumors of a palace coup in which various Kremlin factions vying for power might have ousted him. The Kremlin vigorously denied that anything was amiss, with Putin's spokesman saying the President was healthy and that his handshake \"can break a hand.\" But his absence came at an uneasy time as the country deals with economic turmoil and strained international relations over the war in Ukraine. \"Does Putin ever catch a cold? Does he ever get sick? The Kremlin doesn't want to allow Putin's image of virility and strength to become tarnished by the weaknesses of mere humans,\" CNN analyst Frida Ghitis wrote. \"Putin rules in the old-fashioned style of a personality cult. The system requires propaganda and image control. It needs Putin to be larger than life.\" Last week, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov sought to allay questions, telling Russian radio station Echo of Moscow that people should not worry and that Putin was \"absolutely\" healthy. \"No need to worry, everything is all right. He has working meetings all the time, only not all of these meetings are public,\" Peskov said Thursday. He also dismissed European media reports that Putin had a love child. \"I am going to ask people who have money to organize a contest on the best media rumor,\" the Kremlin spokesman said. Rumblings about Putin began last week after a meeting in the Kazakh capital, Astana, between the Russian leader and the presidents of Kazakhstan and Belarus was postponed at short notice. A Kazakh official told Reuters that Putin had fallen ill. On Thursday, he missed his meeting with the Federal Security Service, Russia's counterintelligence agency. Putin's last public appearance was supposedly on March 8, International Women's Day. But some keeping track say he hadn't been seen since even earlier -- March 5. In the course of his many years in power, Putin has cultivated the image of a strong and vigorous leader. His exploits, captured on film and released to the media, have been many. And he enjoys a whopping 86% approval rating, although some critics question the validity of polling they say is carried out in a climate where people are afraid to voice opposition to Putin's government. \"Moscow always has been a center for rumors and speculation,\" said Jill Dougherty, an expert on Russia at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and a former CNN correspondent. \"As soon as the President does not show up, which is really kind of rare for him, people begin to question. \"You have to look at this in terms of, why all of this insanity? And one of the problems is, people are very nervous, legitimately. Where is Putin? Is he in charge?\" CNN's Matthew Chance contributed to this report.","highlights":"Official: Vladimir Putin has put Russia's Northern Fleet on alert to check its capacity .\nPutin makes light of his absence, saying, \"It would be boring without gossip\"\nThe Russian President meets with President of Kyrgyzstan in St. Petersburg, Russia ."}
{"article":"(CNN)In 2007 I had my ovaries and fallopian tubes removed to prevent my getting ovarian cancer. It was a surgery of the kind that Angelina Jolie recently underwent, as she revealed Tuesday in a New York Times op-ed.  Two years ago, Jolie divulged that she'd had a prophylactic double mastectomy -- I had done this as well, in 2012. Along with the effects of the surgeries themselves, we now also share a related fallout: surgical menopause. This change can be big and, for me, happened almost immediately. There is little easing into it: the age-inappropriate night sweats, hot flashes, weight gain, mood swings.  When I had my ovaries removed at age 37, I suddenly felt less vibrant and beautiful, and instead experienced the slow creep of feeling old.  What will this transition mean to someone like Jolie, so identified for her attractiveness and glamour? (She may keep that part of her transformation private, but -- as with her disclosures about the surgeries -- it might do some good to discuss that, as well.) I've been talking and writing about BRCA1 since I learned more than 10 years ago that I carried this insidious, inherited genetic mutation.  I've discussed how these operations have affected my relationship with my husband and our two children.  But often it takes someone as public, as gorgeous, as famous as Ms. Jolie to powerfully move the conversation about cancer prevention surgeries forward. Her transparency helps normalize the experience of women considering their own options.  It chips away at the stigma surrounding this treatment decision and offers women a new shorthand for explaining such a difficult choice to their families. When I underwent each of my surgeries a few friends looked at me sideways.  They weren't familiar with BRCA and or how surgery could statistically reduce my chances of developing cancer.  Now Ms. Jolie has changed this. Her willingness to share such intimate experiences means more people will become educated and more BRCA survivors will feel free to speak of their scars.  And there are many resources for BRCA-positive women. In June, I will be speaking at the annual FORCE conference (Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered), which has partnered with another wonderful organization, the Basser Research Center for BRCA  (part of the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania). Both are leading the way in the scientific research and understanding of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers.  They also provide resources around risk assessment, prevention, early detection, treatment, and survivorship, as well as links to chat rooms and local support groups. It's not often a writer finds her circumstances so closely in sync with a Hollywood star.  But I like to think Ms. Jolie and I, two women who truly have nothing in common, are linked in our determination to be proactive.  We have looked fear in the face and made the only decisions that made sense for our families and our selves.","highlights":"Like Angelina Jolie, Allison Gilbert had two preventive cancer surgeries to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes and  later her breasts .\nGilbert:Jolie's disclosure about her surgeries has brought needed attention to this surgical option for carriers of insidious BRCA1 gene ."}

{"article":"(CNN)With majorities in both chambers of Congress, it is time for Republicans to begin rolling back six years of failed Obama administration policies. Our highest priority during the ongoing budget debate should be undoing the damage caused by defense sequestration and the hundreds of billions of dollars of defense cuts made by the Obama administration. Regrettably, military strength is seen in many quarters as the cause of military adventurism. A strong, robust defense is seen not to deter aggression, but to provoke it. For years, we have systematically underfunded our military, marrying a philosophy of retreat with a misplaced understanding of our larger budgetary burdens and the real drivers of the debt: our entitlement programs. As expected, almost four years after the passage of the Budget Control Act, virtually nothing has been done to address the unsustainable growth of our entitlement programs, while essential defense programs have been sacrificed. Political leaders in Washington need to be reminded that our defense is the single most important responsibility of the federal government. Instead of starting the process by setting arbitrary defense spending levels and then forcing our military to cut vital programs in order to meet these levels, the budgeting process should start by taking into account all the threats against us, listing the programs and capabilities we'll need to protect our people and interests around the world, and then funding those efforts. Even though we've been able to keep the homeland safe for more than a decade, the threats to Americans at home and abroad are growing.  From the rise of the Islamic State and the spread of Islamic terrorism, to Russia's aggression in Europe, to Chinese expansionism in the South China Sea, the threats to American security are growing. Yet, even as the world outside our borders is filled with more doubt and uncertainty, the United States has been steadily reducing our spending on defense. Even before sequestration, President Obama made defense cuts of $487 billion over 10 years and redirected the savings to already bloated domestic programs. This was followed by tens of billions more in defense cuts each year because of sequestration, which, when combined with Obama's prior cuts, will total $1 trillion over the coming decade. All of these reductions were enacted despite the warnings of four secretaries of defense and our entire military leadership. The results of these cuts have been disastrous for our military and for our ability to project power and deter our enemies. The slight increase in President Obama's proposed 2016 budget won't significantly change that. At the end of this process, our military will be significantly smaller, dramatically less capable and dangerously unready to deploy if these budget cuts remain in place. The Army is on the path to be reduced to pre-World War II levels. The Navy is at pre-WWI levels. And our Air Force has the smallest and oldest combat force in its history. Our force reductions have been felt throughout the world -- by our friends and our enemies. They have presented not just a crisis of readiness for America, but also a perilous strategic weakness. Our adversaries have been emboldened by what they perceive as our diminished military presence. History has shown that every time we have unreasonably cut resources from our military in anticipation of a peace dividend, it has only cost us more to make up for the deficit we create in military readiness and capability, and the expected era of perpetual peace fails to materialize. We think we are saving money, but in the long run, we end up paying more and creating more risk and uncertainty. We can afford the military we need, but we must make it a priority. For this reason, we introduced an amendment to the Senate budget resolution this week to address the dangerous funding gap our military currently faces. We believe we must increase the resources available to our military to the levels proposed by (former) Defense Secretary Robert Gates in his FY12 budget, the last defense budget based solely on an assessment of the threats we face and the requisite military needs to deal with those threats. It is the budget that the bipartisan, congressionally-mandated National Defense Panel stated was \"the minimum required to reverse course and set the military on a more stable footing.\" Now that Republicans control both house of Congress, it is time to support a defense budget that actually reflects the world in which we live, not the world the way we wish it was. Until now, our approach as a country and a party since the Budget Control Act has not been one of American strength. Continuing on the current path will only invite war and conflict through weakness. We need to heed the bipartisan warnings of our nation's military leaders and get back on track toward a defense budget that reflects the realities of the challenges we face and is worthy of our brave men and women in uniform.  In the end, it is they who will suffer the most if sequestration is not reversed and our readiness and equipment continues to degrade. As members of Congress, we have a sacred obligation to ensure that they have the best possible training and equipment so they can successfully complete their missions. Despite the fiscal constraints imposed on our military, they are doing their part and are holding up their end of the bargain. It's time that we hold up ours.","highlights":"Senators Rubio, Cotton: As threats have grown, U.S. defense budget has faced cuts .\nThey say spending to strengthen U.S. forces is a necessity ."}

{"article":"Evergreen Paul O'Connell can still scale new heights ahead of notching his 100th Ireland cap in Saturday's pivotal RBS 6 Nations showdown in Wales, according to Sean Cronin. Veteran lock O'Connell will equal Mick Galwey's record as Ireland's oldest captain of all time at exactly 35 years and 145 days at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday. The Munster talisman will become just the fourth star to hit 100 Tests for Ireland, joining Brian O'Driscoll, Ronan O'Gara and John Hayes in the century club. Sean Cronin believes veteran Paul O'Connell (above) still has a long career ahead of him . Leinster hooker Cronin hailed O'Connell's 'intensity and physicality' as the crux of Ireland's relentless pursuit of ever-higher standards under taskmaster boss Joe Schmidt. 'It's a phenomenal achievement: I think he's getting better with it even as the years go on,' said Cronin, as Ireland look to home in on a second Grand Slam in six years this weekend. 'But he's the kind of player that, whenever he's playing, he nearly makes you play better because that's the enthusiasm, the passion, the physicality that he brings. 'He kind of instils that in the players around him, it's great to play under him. 'He sets the standard and you've got to get up there with him. 'He'll demand it off you one way or another, so it's great to play with a person like that, because it raises your standards as well.' O'Connell will equal Mick Galwey's record as Ireland's oldest captain of all time on Saturday . O'Connell will stride past a multitude of milestones in Cardiff this weekend, as he aims to mark his 50th Six Nations performance by setting Ireland a new winning Test run of 11 matches. Wales and Scotland block Ireland's path to Grand Slam glory and a third career Six Nations crown for O'Connell. As the teams complete preparations in the Millennium Stadium's bowels this weekend, O'Connell will launch into a trademark tub-thumping team talk. Cronin acknowledged the legend around O'Connell bringing team-mates to tears with his unbridled pre-match passion - but admitted the Munster stalwart's rhetoric far more fearsome than emotive. The 35-year-old is put through his paces during an Ireland training session at the Kingspan Stadium . 'I've nipped out a couple of times to dot the eyes during his talks!' joked Cronin of myths O'Connell can invoke raw emotions. 'No, but seriously, he scares me more than makes me cry to be honest with you. 'He brings a certain level, you see him doing it, his intensity, physicality, attention to detail. 'So when you see him doing that, you're saying to yourself 'I need to get to that as well'. 'If 15 or 23 lads get to that level, we're hard to beat. 'He's similar to Joe (Schmidt) in some ways. 'Paul isn't going to get to the heights of Test rugby that he has without hard work and accuracy.

{"article":"(CNN)As expected, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a rousing speech to Congress, rich in historic imagery and replete with literary references. Yet a speech filled with powerful words is no substitute for a strategy for actually preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. As national security adviser Susan Rice told the pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC on Monday, \"Precisely because this is such a serious issue, we must weigh the different options before us and choose the best one. Sound bites won't stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.\" The Obama administration, on the other hand, is making a strong and credible case that the deal it is pursuing would block Iran's pathways to developing the fissile material necessary for a bomb and extend the time for Iran to produce enough weapons-grade uranium to build a bomb from today's estimated three months to at least a year. Without a deal, Iran would revert to building up its stockpile of nuclear uranium, while the international community would lose the ability to monitor and track Iran's activities. At the top of the list of questions the Prime Minister failed to address is how such a scenario in the wake of \"no deal\" would actually make Israel safer? As Rice said: \"Here's what's likely to happen without a deal. Iran will install and operate advanced centrifuges. Iran will seek to fuel its (plutonium) reactor in Arak. Iran will rebuild its uranium stockpile.  And, we'll lose the unprecedented inspections and transparency we have today.\" If no deal that the United States and five other powers actually might strike with the Iranians would be acceptable to Netanyahu, how does he propose to deal with the Iranian nuclear threat? He spoke about ratcheting up international sanctions against Iran and keeping them in place until Iran ceased regional aggression, sponsorship of terrorism and threatens to annihilate Israel. But years of extraordinarily tough sanctions did not persuade the Iranians to abandon their nuclear program or prevent them moving it forward. Neither did cyberwarfare or a series of assassinations of Iranian scientists. And if the United States was seen as walking away from a possible agreement, the international sanctions regime would likely crumble, not strengthen. Iranian hard-liners who oppose an agreement would be back in the driver's seat in Tehran, while those would want to see Iran rejoin the international community would be discredited and sidelined. It is doubtful that Netanyahu really believes sanctions would end the Iranian nuclear program. That leaves one other option -- military force. Of course, Israel could order a military strike on Iran any time it chooses, but Israel's ability to inflict significant damage on Iran's widely dispersed and heavily defended nuclear facilities is limited. When the discussion turns to military action, what is really meant is U.S. military action. It is understandable that a foreign leader speaking in the U.S. Congress would shy away from openly asking Washington to attack another country, especially after the experience of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which Netanyahu also lobbied for. We should recall Netanyahu's September 2002 testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, six months before the U.S. assault on Baghdad began, when he said: \"It's not a question of whether Iraq's regime should be taken out but when should it be taken out; it's not a question of whether you'd like to see a regime change in Iran but how to achieve it.\" Netanyahu may have learned from that experience. He knows that the U.S. public is weary of war and has no appetite for another military adventure in the Middle East. That's why he advocates policies that would put the United States on a path to military action without mentioning the words \"military action.\" This Israeli leader, who faces a tough election back home in two weeks, has mastered the art of policy vagueness. He applied the same strategy to the failed negotiations with the Palestinians last year, declaring he was in favor of a two-state solution but never putting forward a detailed proposal for where the border should be drawn -- or on any other substantive issue for that matter. His biggest demand once again was rhetorical -- that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state. This is an Israeli leader who believes in the power of words -- especially his words. But words are no substitute for a strategy -- and that's where Netanyahu once again failed himself, his country and his audience.","highlights":"Jeremy Ben-Ami: Netanyahu's powerfully worded speech is no substitute for a strategy to keep Iran from getting nuclear weapons .\nHe says without a plan, the only option is to put U.S. on path to military action .\nNetanyahu also lobbied for Iraq invasion in 2002, Ben-Ami says ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Scientists at NASA are one step closer to understanding how much water could have existed on primeval Mars. These new findings also indicate how primitive water reservoirs there could have evolved over billions of years, indicating that early oceans on the Red Planet might have held more water than Earth's Arctic Ocean, NASA scientists reveal in a study published Friday in the journal Science. \"Our study provides a solid estimate of how much water Mars once had, by determining how much water was lost to space,\" said Geronimo Villanueva, a scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"With this work, we can better understand the history of water on Mars.\" To find answers to this age-old question about Martian water molecules, scientists used the world's three major infrared telescopes, in Chile and Hawaii, to measure traces of water in the planet's atmosphere over a range of areas and seasons, spanning from March 2008 to January 2014. \"From the ground, we could take a snapshot of the whole hemisphere on a single night,\" said Goddard's Michael Mumma. Scientists looked at the ratio of two different forms -- or isotopes -- of water, H2O and HDO. The latter is made heavier by one of its hydrogen atoms, called deuterium, which has a neutron at its core in addition to the proton that all hydrogen atoms have. That weighed down HDO more, while larger amounts of hydrogen from H2O floated into the atmosphere, broke away from Mars' low gravity and disappeared into space. As a result, water trapped in Mars' polar ice caps has a much higher level of HDO than fluid water on Earth does, the scientists said. The scientists compared the ratio of H2O to HDO in Mars' atmosphere today to the ratio of the two molecules trapped inside a Mars meteorite, a stone that broke off from Mars -- perhaps when an asteroid hit -- and landed on Earth some 4.5 billion years ago. They were able to determine how much that ratio had changed over time and estimate how much water has disappeared from Mars -- about 87%. The findings indicate that the Red Planet could have had its fair share of blue waters, possibly even yielding an ocean. According to NASA, there might have been enough water to cover up to 20% of Mars' surface. That would amount to an ocean proportionally larger than the Atlantic on Earth. \"This ocean had a maximum depth of around 5,000 feet or around one mile deep,\" said Villanueva. NASA scientists say that much of this water loss happened over billions of years, along with a loss of atmosphere. And as the planet's atmospheric pressure dropped, it was harder for water to stay in liquid form. Heat also contributed to its evaporation. As a result, the remaining primeval ocean water continued to move toward the poles, where it eventually froze. \"With Mars losing that much water, the planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" said Mumma. CNN's Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","highlights":"Scientists studied water in Mars' atmosphere with three giant infrared telescopes .\nThey compared the ratio of certain molecules on the planet with that of a Mars meteorite that landed on Earth ."}

The episode marks the first rescue of a leatherback sea turtle in South Carolina and is believed to be only the fifth live rescue of this species in the United States, according to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. The endangered turtle was found stranded on the Yawkey-South Island Preserve, a wildlife refuge near Georgetown, South Carolina. Rescuers named it Yawkey. Because the turtle is believed to be a juvenile -- rescuers say it's probably less than 10 years old -- and has not reached sexual maturity, biologists can't yet determine its sex. Rescuers found no external signs of trauma to the reptile, although it was hypoglycemic. Staffers with the aquarium's sea turtle rescue program gave it antibiotics, vitamins and some time to recover at their facilities. The treatments appear to be helping. Aquarium officials said the turtle was more energetic Tuesday than when it was first admitted. Even so, leatherback turtles historically don't do well in captivity. For that reason, aquarium staffers are working with the state's Department of Natural Resources to determine the best place and time to release the turtle back into the ocean -- most likely within the next few days. Leatherbacks are the largest turtles on Earth and can grow up to 2,000 pounds.

{"article":"(CNN)Creflo Dollar's new scheme to raise $60 million to purchase a luxury Gulfstream G650 airplane is the latest chapter in a long and sordid history of televangelists exploiting their churches' tax-exempt status -- and their congregants -- to line their own pockets. Preaching the word of faith, or \"prosperity gospel,\" and capitalizing on lax government oversight of his church's finances has enriched Dollar and his family to the detriment of his followers and the American taxpayer. World Changers Church International, Dollar's 30,000-member church, is a tax-exempt organization under the Internal Revenue Code. That means the church's donors receive a tax exemption for their donations (including for Dollar's new jet ambitions), and the church pays no tax on the revenue. What's more, because it is organized as a church, the federal government does not require World Changers to file a publicly available tax return, as other nonprofit organizations are required to do. Those tax returns provide at least some financial information to donors and the public about the organization, including its revenues, assets, expenditures and executive compensation. Dollar is known for his custom suits, luxury homes and private jets that ferry him, among other places, from his home base in College Park, Georgia, to his satellite church in Manhattan, where he and his wife reportedly have a $2.5 million apartment. For Dollar, though, these excesses aren't embarrassments. Instead, they are proof that his theology works, that God blesses the faithful with abundant riches. Dollar tells his congregants to \"sow a seed\" with him, promising that a plentiful harvest will be their own blessing and, essentially, a return on their investment. To promoters of the word of faith, or prosperity gospel, \"sowing a seed\" with your pastor is required for God's blessing, even if you're taking it out of your rent money or the last remaining cash in your wallet. Many Christians find word of faith a heretical theology, an embarrassing distortion of Jesus' teachings, not to mention a fraud on congregants. While the government cannot constitutionally mediate theological disputes or otherwise interfere in a church's internal affairs, it can use its oversight powers to ensure that preachers who use their pulpits for profit don't exploit the tax advantages afforded to ordinary houses of worship to pursue their legitimate charitable purposes. In 2007, the Senate Finance Committee, under the chairmanship of Iowa Republican Sen. Charles Grassley, launched an investigation into the financial practices of six televangelists, including Dollar. The committee requested documents from Dollar and his wife, Taffi, explaining that taxpayers \"should be assured that their donations are being used for the tax exempt purposes of the organizations.\" The documents sought by the committee included audited financial statements for World Changers, information about related for-profit and nonprofit entities, and data on executive compensation and the church's real and personal assets. More than three years later, after an outcry from the televangelists, most visibly Dollar's mentor Kenneth Copeland, the committee opted to abandon its efforts to instigate any sort of regulatory changes. Instead, the committee called on the ministries to engage in \"self-reform,\" even though the committee staff's findings plainly demonstrated that four of the ministries, including Dollar's, were unwilling to engage in any sort of meaningful transparency or accountability. Of the six televangelists from whom the committee sought financial data, Dollar was deemed the \"least cooperative.\" Without Dollar's cooperation, the committee was left to piece together a puzzle about his finances through public documents, third parties and news reports. It concluded that in 2006, World Changers had received $69 million in contributions at its Atlanta church alone, that the Dollars owned two multimillion-dollar homes in Georgia, and that the church and related business entities had at various points owned four aircraft flown for personal use -- although none was nearly as pricey as the luxury Gulfstream Dollar now seeks to acquire. The committee staff was clearly troubled by the array of business entities, \"including private airports and aircraft leasing companies,\" that raised red flags \"about the use of the church's tax-exempt status to avoid taxation.\" Precisely because of Dollar's lack of cooperation, the staff concluded, \"we are unable to determine whether and the extent to which they are reporting and paying taxes on income earned in those entities.\" Dollar is now looking to raise $60 million for this new aircraft, purportedly \"to continue reaching a lost and dying world for the Lord Jesus Christ.\" Four years after the abandonment of the Senate Finance Committee's televangelist investigation, it looks like the absence of government oversight has only emboldened Creflo Dollar.","highlights":"Sarah Posner: Televangelist Creflo Dollar asking congregants to help finance a $65 million Gulfstream G650 .\nShe says government should oversee tax-exempt churches that essentially operate as for-profit enterprises .\nPosner: Senate committee took up this issue but dropped it; this seems to have emboldened Dollar ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Archaeologists searching for a lost city in the jungles of Honduras have discovered the urban remains of what they believe is a vanished ancient civilization, National Geographic reports. A writer and photographer for the magazine accompanied a team of scientists to Honduras' Mosquitia region on the trail of a legendary \"White City\" or \"City of the Monkey God.\" The expedition was launched after aerial light detection scanning  -- known as LIDAR -- uncovered what appeared to be man-made structures below the rainforest, National Geographic said. Seeking to confirm the discovery, a team of U.S. and Honduran archaeologists, a LIDAR engineer, an ethnobotanist, anthropologists and documentary filmmakers entered the remote region. They were protected by Honduran Special forces, the magazine said. Writer Douglas Preston said the team emerged February 25, after documenting the ruins of a \"vanished culture.\" \"In contrast to the nearby Maya, this vanished culture has been scarcely studied and it remains virtually unknown. Archaeologists don't even have a name for it,\" Douglas wrote. Archaeologists no longer believed in the existence of a single \"White City,\" he said, instead believing there had been an entire civilization with many cities. The expedition found earth works, including an earthen pyramid as well as a collection of stone sculptures, thought to potentially have been burial offerings. Archaeologist Oscar Neil Cruz from the Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History (IHAH) estimated they dated from A.D. 1000 to 1400, Douglas wrote. The researchers were greeted by wildlife which appeared never before to have seen humans, wandering unafraid through their camp. \"This is clearly the most undisturbed rain forest in Central America. The importance of this place can't be overestimated,\" ethnobotanist Mark Plotkin told National Geographic. The team left their finds unexcavated and are keeping the exact location of the site secret in an attempt to prevent looting. But in his article, Douglas warned that that the area was nonetheless under threat, with illegal logging for cattle farming within a dozen miles. IHAH director Virgilio Paredes Trapero told National Geographic that the forest and valley could disappear within eight years unless action was taken. \"The Honduran government is committed to protecting this area, but doesn't have the money. We urgently need international support.\"","highlights":"National Geographic has announced the discovery of a lost city in the remote Honduran rainforest .\nThe magazine says scientists believe the city belonged to a mysterious ancient civilization .\nA team documented the site after aerial light scanning showed man-made structures ."}

{"article":"Jon Stead was looking forward to a pre-season trip to the Algarve when he noticed his passport on the bench beneath his peg in the Huddersfield Town dressing-room. Strange. He had only just handed it in. It was then that he scanned \u2013 and rescanned - the squad list for the warm-weather getaway. Stead was grounded. \u2018I didn\u2019t know what I\u2019d done wrong, the manager (Mark Robins) never said a word to me,\u2019 the 31-year-old tells Sportsmail as he reflects on the shock of his summer exile. Jon Stead (front) celebrates Bradford's famous comeback win against Chelsea in the FA Cup fourth round . The Huddersfield loanee converts the Bantams' second goal against Sunderland in the fifth round . \u2018I thought, \u201cWhat sort of season am I going to have here?\u201d. It was a surprise because I felt good, but I certainly knew where I stood when I saw my passport. \u2018They left me behind and went to Portugal. I was getting changed in the senior dressing-room by myself every day, it was soul-destroying.\u2019 Eight months on, however, and it is Stead who is flying. On Saturday lunchtime the Bradford City loanee will bid to extend his remarkable run of having scored in every round of the FA Cup when Reading visit Valley Parade. He is one win away from a first appearance at Wembley. \u2018I never dreamt my season would play out like this,\u2019 he says. \u2018I was left to train with the Under-21s but the young lads gave me enthusiasm and it was pleasure to work with them. I just went back to basics and worked my socks off. Stead was left out of the squad for Huddersfield's pre-season tour but is now in fine scoring form at Bradford . \u2018After that I just needed that chance to go and play and unleash myself. Bradford has been perfect for me.\u2019 His dad is a police detective and has worked in football, including spotting hooligans at the World Cup. Stead was Bristol City\u2019s player of the year in 2011-12, despite playing only six hours of football before the end of February. He is from Holmfirth, the West Yorkshire village where Last of the Summer Wine was filmed. P.S. Stead has five goals and three assists in the FA Cup this season. Only Saido Berahino (five goals, four assists) has been involved in more goals. It was in October that Stead journeyed north across the M62 and joined the League One Bantams. Within a few weeks he was scoring the goal which, on reflection, he admits could prove the most important of them all. Phil Parkinson\u2019s side were trailing 1-0 at Halifax in the First Round and had barely laid a finger on the Conference outfit when Stead pounced to level in the second half. \u2018It\u2019s incredible to be on this scoring run, but the goal everyone forgets is the one at Halifax - without that we might not be here now,\u2019 he says. After that came a cool finish in a 4-1 victory over Dartford before a close-range sweep to help dispose of Millwall during a 4-0 triumph on home soil, the prize for which was a trip to Chelsea. At 3.40pm they trailed 2-0 to the Premier League leaders and odds of 1000\/1 were available on a turnaround. It was then that Stead drilled home from the edge of the area. \u2018Without that I think the game would have drifted away,\u2019 he says. Bradford won 4-2 to set up a home tie against Stead\u2019s former club Sunderland, whose fans once produced a T-shirt mocking the striker\u2019s 30-game wait for his first goal. The striker now has five goals in the prestigious tournament this term, including this strike against Chelsea . Stead (right) celebrates after beating Sunderland 2-0 in the fifth round with team-mate James Hanson . It was sweet, then, when he fired the tie-clincher during a 2-0 victory in front of 4,000 travelling Black Cats. \u2018Not only was it a crucial goal but it was nice to prove a point,\u2019 he says. \u2018They had their opinion of me, although I always took the T-shirt in good spirit. \u2018But these things have a habit of biting you on the backside, don\u2019t they? \u2018One newspaper were trying to get me to wear the T-shirt underneath my Bradford top. I thought about it but I would have looked stupid had we got beat and I didn\u2019t score.\u2019 The goal marked the 100th of Stead\u2019s career. Billed as the next Alan Shearer when Blackburn paid hometown Huddersfield \u00a31.25million 11 years ago, the England Under-21 regular never scaled the heights perhaps expected. \u2018Everything had been so good for me at Huddersfield. I had no experience of things going wrong,\u2019 he recalls. \u2018It didn\u2019t work out at Blackburn or Sunderland but I didn\u2019t have the knowhow to turn it around. Stead was mocked for his strike rate at Sunderland (right) but proved a point with a goal against his old club . \u2018It wasn\u2019t until Sheffield United in the Premier League that I rediscovered myself. Then we had the Carlos Tevez affair and were relegated. It just felt like little breaks were going against me. \u2018But I\u2019m proud of what I have achieved over 10 years at Championship level. The gaffer says I\u2019m actually getting better \u2013 I\u2019m certainly not getting quicker! \u2018I think he\u2019s got a point though. I feel I\u2019m playing at a higher level for longer periods. After what happened during the summer I feel like I have a renewed energy for it. \u2018It\u2019s good timing, especially with my deal being up in the summer. It\u2019s nice to get my name out there and I have got a lot of football left in me. \u2018There will be discussions with Bradford and if I stay that will be fantastic.\u2019 Stead, meanwhile, has had to persuade his lucky mascot and four-year-old daughter Isabelle to come to today\u2019s game rather than a pantomime. Should her dad score in another Bradford upset then it will be him taking centre stage in a Wembley semi-final. Forget the Algarve, now that would be the dream ticket.

{"article":"(CNN)The 1-0 scoreline that took Barcelona through to the Champions League quarterfinals made their clash with Manchester City all seem rather academic. Yet it was anything but as Lionel Messi's masterful first-half display had some purring once again about his status as the greatest footballer of all time. Meanwhile, the second half witnessed another masterclass as England international Joe Hart somehow kept City in a lively encounter with save after save. In between, the man that City usually rely on to dig them out of tight spots -- Sergio Aguero -- failed to score a late penalty that could have set up a tense finish. In truth, the English champions deserved little over the two legs as Barcelona built upon their 2-1 victory in Manchester three weeks ago to go through as 3-1 aggregate winners. The four-time champions may not have added the goals they deserved but they did reach the last eight for the eighth year in a row, a competition record. \"It was a game with a lot of chances where we could have finished it off a lot earlier,\" Barca coach Luis Enrique told reporters. \"We got what we wanted which was to go through to the next round and I am happy with the display. We played well and this is a big boost for us at this stage of the season.\" The high-profile scrutiny of the relationship between coach Enrique and Argentine superstar Lionel Messi suddenly seems a distant memory with Barca still capable of repeating their wonder year of 2009. On that occasion, they won the Champions League, La Liga and Spanish Super Cup under the guidance of Pep Guardiola, who was one of many enthralled spectators inside the Camp Nou. Now in charge of fellow quarterfinalists Bayern Munich, Guardiola was out of his seat -- seemingly in celebration -- as Ivan Rakitic opened the scoring after 31 minutes when lifting the ball over Hart following a fine pass from Messi. The diminutive Argentine flashed two free-kicks from distance onto the top of the goal netting while also displaying an array of twists, turns and embarrassing 'nutmegs' for his opponents. It was enough to make former England international Gary Lineker, the top scorer at the 1986 World Cup, proclaim him the best footballer ever. While that engrossing debate rumbles on, Messi set about trying to put the tie to bed but he met fierce resistance from Hart, who had kept City in the tie in the first leg when saving the Argentine's injury-time penalty. England's number one made 10 saves, the most of any keeper in any Champions League this season, not only repelling Messi but also Neymar and Suarez, both of whom were also denied by the post in the first half. To their credit, the Premier League side -- who were looking to reach the Champions League quarterfinals for the first time -- improved after the break but found chances hard to come by. That was until Aguero won a penalty after going down under a challenge from first Gerard Pique, and then Argentina colleague Javier Mascherano, with just over ten minutes left. But Dutch keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen dived right -- in both senses -- to beat away the spotkick and ultimately seal City's fate. Barcelona can now prepare for Sunday's superclasico clash with Real Madrid, whom they lead in the La Liga table by one point. \"We've gone out to a magnificent side for the second time in two years,\" Joe Hart told Sky Sports television. \"They will get a lot of plaudits but we had a big chance with the penalty.\" Questions will now be asked of coach Manuel Pellegrini, who had been expected to perform better in the Champions League after Roberto Mancini twice failed to get out of the group stages. It means that for the second time in three years, no English team have made the last eight, where Barca have joined Madrid sides Real and Atletico, Bayern Munich, Monaco, Paris Saint-Germain, Porto and Juventus. The latter made it through after beating Borussia Dortmund 3-0 in Germany to secure a convincing 5-1 aggregate victory. On a night when Manchester City had failed to score, it was not lost on many that their former striker Carlos Tevez netted twice and made one, converted by Alvaro Morata, for the Italians. \"It was a game to forget. It started badly and did not get any better,\" Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp, who led his side to the 2013 Champions League final, told reporters. \"We deserved to be eliminated.\" The draw for the quarterfinals will be held on Friday.","highlights":"Barca and Juve join Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Monaco, PSG, Porto and Bayern Munich in Champions League quarterfinals ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Chinese relic experts claim that a 1,000-year-old mummified monk encased in a Buddha statue was stolen from a village temple in Eastern China in 1995, state media reported. The mummy made international headlines last year when it first showcased at Drents Museum in the Netherlands. The Cultural Relic Bureau in Fujian province launched an investigation and found photos and historical records suggesting the statue belonged to a village temple where it was worshiped as an ancestor. The bureau will continue the investigation and report to national cultural authorities to seek repatriation in compliance with normal procedures, a spokesperson told the state-run Xinhua news agency on Sunday. The statue, currently in possession of a Dutch private collector, was being housed at the Hungarian Natural History Museum as a part of a European tour. The museum announced on their website that the mummy, originally scheduled to be on display until May, has been pulled from the exhibition at \"the request of the loaning partner\" -- the Drents Museum. It's unclear exactly when or how the statue made its way to a market in the Netherlands where a private buyer bought it in 1996. Drents Museum said the owner, who prefers to remain anonymous, had bought it legally. The mummy was discovered when the owner brought it to an expert for restoration. But it wasn't until a team of researchers and scientists did a CT scan -- a comprehensive three dimensional X-ray image -- last year, did they discover the mummy's organs were missing. \"We thought it would be lung tissue, but instead we found little scraps of paper covered with Chinese characters,\" said Vincent van Vilsteren, an archaeology curator from Drents Museum. The mummy was found sitting on a bundle of cloth covered in Chinese inscriptions, revealing its identity as a Buddhist monk called Liuquan who may have practiced \"self-mummification\" to prepare for life after death. The process of self-mummification is a known tradition in countries like Japan, China and Thailand, and was practiced more than a thousand years ago. The elaborate and arduous process includes eating a special diet and drinking a poisonous tea so the body would be too toxic to be eaten by maggots. The few monks that were able to successfully complete the process were highly revered. \"We suspect that for the first 200 years, the mummy was exposed and worshiped in a Buddhist temple in China ... only in the 14th century did they do all the work to transform it into a nice statue,\" said van Vilsteren. Researchers are still waiting on DNA analysis results to help trace the mummy back to its exact location in China.","highlights":"Chinese relic experts claim that a mummified monk encased in a statue was stolen .\nThe statue was bought in 1996 at a market in the Netherlands .\nResearchers believe the monk practiced \"self-mummification\""}

{"article":"(CNN)For the first time, the U.S. Air Force has resurrected a B-52 bomber that had been in long-term storage at the Boneyard, the portion of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base near Tucson, Arizona, where the military sends aircraft that have been retired from the fleet. The 53-year-old Stratofortress, tail number 61-1007, nicknamed the \"Ghost Rider\" had been in storage at the desert in the care of the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) since 2008. Thousands of aircraft are stored at the Boneyard, where the dry desert environment helps preserve them. Some are scavenged to supply parts to planes still in the fleet. Others are brought back into service. Ghost Rider, after upgrades, will become the first B-52 to return to duty from the Boneyard. Though the dry desert air inhibits corrosion, the baking heat can have other adverse effects, including causing dry rot in the tires and fuel lines. The lines and fuel bladders in Ghost Rider were completely replaced, Tech. Sgt. Stephen Sorge, a fuels specialist from the 307th Maintenance Squadron, said in an Air Force report on the project. Once that work was done, the plane's engines were tested again in January. On February 13, Ghost Rider flew again, a three-hour flight from Davis-Monthan to its new home, Barksdale Air Force Base in Shreveport, Louisiana. The resurrection process took 70 days, according to the Air Force report . \"I've been flying the B-52s since the '80s and it surprised me that after almost seven years ... she cranked up just fine and we had no issues with the flight control systems,\" Col. Keith Schultz said in the Air Force report after piloting the eight-engine jet on the 1,000-mile flight. Schultz, who with more than 6,500 hours flying B-52s is the most experienced active pilot of that aircraft in the service, led a co-pilot and a navigator, the minimum three-person crew, on the flight to Louisiana. The B-52 would normally fly with a crew of five. \"Those were the only three seats we had activated for egress,\" he told the Shreveport Times. For safety reasons, Ghost Rider made the entire flight with its landing gear down, at a speed of only 288 mph and at a height of 23,000 feet, well below its top speed of 650 mph and ceiling of 50,000 feet, according to the Times report. It also flew without some of the other things aviators have come to rely on. \"We were fortunate to have had good weather the entire trip as the inertial and navigational equipment had not been installed,\" Schulz said in the Air Force release. Ghost Rider will replace another bomber at Barksdale that was damaged by a fire during maintenance. \"We had an oxygen leak with a spark and it caused a cockpit fire. There was so much damage it was actually more economical to bring this one out of the desert,\" Schultz told the Times. For a time, Ghost Rider will sit beside the damaged B-52 for transfer of usable, updated equipment, the Times reported. It is expected to resume active service next year. As of May 2014, the Air Force reported there were 76 Stratofortresses in its fleet, 58 in the active force and 18 in the Air Force Reserve. Besides Barksdale, B-52s are based at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota.","highlights":"U.S. Air Force resurrects B-52 Stratofortress for return to service .\nThe 53-year-old Stratofortress, retired in 2008, is nicknamed \"Ghost Rider\"\n\"After almost seven years...she cranked up just fine,\" pilot says ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Real Madrid's star-studded attacking force might be struggling to fire, but Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has no such problems with his wealth of talent up front. Sunday's 6-1 demolition of Rayo Vallecano put the Catalan side one point above Real at the top of Spain's La Liga, with Lionel Messi setting more records as he netted a hat-trick while fellow forward Luis Suarez also scored twice. Even without suspended Brazil star Neymar -- the third prong of Barca's striking line -- Enrique was able to happily reflect on a result that fully rubbed salt in Madrid wounds following Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Athletic Bilbao. \"We're elated, but the objective is to be leading at the end of the season. I already said that everybody could lose a game, so we have to keep playing well and win every match,\" he said. \"It's heavy having to win every single match. Each game is more important than the last.\" By contrast, Real coach Carlo Ancelotti is feeling the strain after also dropping points last weekend against Villarreal. \"There is no link-up play, our play is too based around individual play, we need another way of attacking, with faster play and fewer touches,\" said the Italian, who must rouse his troops for Tuesday's European Champions League last-16, second-leg tie at home to Schalke. \"It is quite confusing to see what we're doing at the moment in attack. The ball doesn't move around quickly.\" While Real's front trio of top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale are struggling to match their form from the first half of this season, Barca's star men are moving into menacing mode ahead of the rival teams' \"El Clasico\" clash at the Nou Camp in a fortnight. Messi's 32nd career hat-trick is a record for a Spanish club player, and took him past Ronaldo as the La Liga leader on 24 trebles. The Argentina star also drew level with the Portugal captain as the Spanish league's top scorer this season on 30 goals. It's the sixth successive season in which he has topped 40 goals, with 41 from 38 games so far this campaign. Suarez has now scored six goals in his last four games, and 13 from 26 overall appearances since joining from English club Liverpool after a World Cup that ended in a lengthy ban for his bite on Italy's Giorgio Chiellini. \"Suarez and Messi are having more and more chemistry, and today we all saw what they bring to the team,\" Enrique said. \"I like (Ivan) Rakitic wherever he plays on the field. He always knows what to do with the ball and is one of the best signings we've ever had.\" \"(Gerard) Piqu\u00e9 has always known how to score, above all on set plays. It's a perfect solution for games when our opponents collapse defensively.\" Both teams had a player sent off in front of a crowd of over 87,000, Barca's best this season: Rayo defender Tito for a foul on Suarez in the 55th minute that allowed Messi to make it 3-0 with a retaken penalty; and Dani Alves for tripping Alberto Bueno, who also netted the resulting spot-kick. Barca's 20th win from 26 league games put the club seven points clear of third-placed Atletico Madrid after the defending champion's 1-1 home draw with fourth-placed Valencia later Sunday. Koke put Atletico ahead in the first half but Shkodran Mustafi headed an equalizer with 12 minutes left, while Valencia teammate Javi Fuego received two late yellow cards. Sixth-placed Villarreal beat Celta Vigo 4-0, while Real Sociedad beat Espanyol 1-0 in a mid-table clash.

{"article":"(CNN)Was the Middle East better off under dictatorships? It is certainly tempting to think so when one looks at conflicts in the region today, from Yemen to Libya to Syria. Those three countries have followed different trajectories since the start of the Arab Spring in 2011, but what they have in common now is instability that is not likely to be overcome in the short term. While this instability is making the West -- particularly the United States -- uncomfortable, it is also a direct result of the West's own stance towards dictatorships in the region prior to and during the Arab Spring. The West's shortsightedness in handling the Middle East throughout its modern history has directly contributed to its current devastation. Before 2011, what the West most valued in the Middle East was stability rather than democracy. Arab dictatorships were tolerated for decades despite their cruelty because they served Western economic, political, and security interests. In Egypt, Hosni Mubarak was seen as the bulwark of peace with Israel. In Libya, a reformed Moammar Gadhafi was courted for potential investment and trade agreements. In Syria, Bashar al-Assad was a predictable leader who maintained the Golan Heights as a conflict-free zone. In Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh was regarded as an ally against al Qaeda. Dictatorships kept the status quo manageable. Government suppression of activism and of the alternative voices of civil society and independent media meant that top-down decisions were rarely contested. This pretty much guaranteed that Western interests would be served without too many complications. In return, Arab dictators enjoyed Western financial and military aid and political reassurances. Yemen was the epitome of this dynamic. Saleh courted and was courted by American diplomats who turned a blind eye to his transgressions, from arms smuggling to forcing new businesses to include him as a \"partner\" so that he could ensure a cut in the profits, while most Yemenis lived below the bread line. READ MORE: How we got here in Yemen . Saleh's value was in engaging in the \"war on terror\" through allowing American drones to strike al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The fact that he used this engagement as an excuse to ask for military assistance for Yemen -- which in reality was used to equip what would become a private army -- was considered a small price to pay by the United States. When the reality of living under dictatorships became exposed with the Arab Spring, the West could no longer ignore it and had to publicly declare support for the uprisings. But the West did not have a long-term strategy for handling the aftermath of dictatorships -- and the results have been catastrophic. Libya saw hasty international military intervention without a vision for stabilizing the country, and today is falling apart. Syria saw diplomatic toing and froing that eventually dragged the West into a messy war. Yemen was for a while thought of as an acceptable compromise because of the Gulf Cooperation Council's initiative that ended the uprising through a negotiated transition from Saleh to his deputy Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi. But the long-term implications for this transition were ignored and Yemen today is paying the price. Yemen summarizes all the ills of dictatorships and their handling by foreign patrons. The West was na\u00efve to think that Saleh would simply accept his removal from power. In an ironic turn of events, he has found in the Houthi rebels-- who had been marginalized under his rule and became even more so under Hadi -- an unlikely ally to regain influence. Saudi Arabia was also na\u00efve in thinking that Houthi rule in northern Yemen would be better than having a political presence for the Muslim Brotherhood -- the Kingdom's staunchest political foe -- in Sanaa. The Saudis and the West ignored the simmering sectarian tensions between the Zaidi Houthis and the Sunni tribes of Yemen, not to mention the popular anger at U.S.-led drone attacks that sometimes killed civilians. They also ignored Iran's rising ambitions; why would the Houthis -- Iran's allies -- limit themselves to northern Yemen if they could also expand southwards and rule the whole country? The situation in Yemen today shows that even though the status quo under dictatorships may have appeared stable, beneath the surface volcanoes were preparing to erupt. Dictators may keep a country secure, but they do that at the expense of their own people. They may support the West's interests, but they will turn against them whenever their own interests are threatened. Although many today lament that the Arab Spring has turned into an Arab Winter, the conflicts emerging across the Middle East are largely the result of the political, economic, and social ills of dictatorships and the conditions that had sustained them. They have come to the surface because the lid has been lifted. But the current misery in the Middle East still does not mean that the region was better off under dictatorships. The aftermath of dictatorships is always messy, and democratic transition is never linear. Those with nostalgia for the days of Arab strongmen should remember that autocratic regimes plant the seed of future unrest and therefore only offer false, temporary security -- even if \"temporary\" takes a few decades to pass.","highlights":"Khatib: West supported Mideast dictators until it became unpalatable in 2011 .\nKhatib: West's lack of a plan for aftermath of dictatorships has been catastrophic ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Saudi and allied warplanes struck rebels in Yemen on Thursday, with Saudi Arabia threatening to send ground troops and inserting itself into its southern neighbor's civil war, potentially opening up a broader sectarian conflict in the Middle East. The swift and sudden action involved 100 Saudi jets, 30 from the United Arab Emirates, 15 each from Kuwait and Bahrain, 10 from Qatar, and a handful from Jordan, Morocco and Sudan, plus naval help from Pakistan and Egypt, according to a Saudi adviser. The Egyptian state news agency on Thursday quoted Egypt's Foreign Ministry as saying Egypt's support also could involve ground forces. What do those countries have in common? They're all predominantly Sunni Muslim -- in contrast to the Houthi rebels, Shiite Muslims who have taken over Yemen's capital of Sanaa and on Wednesday captured parts of its second-largest city, Aden. The Saudis consider the Houthis proxies for the Shiite government of Iran and fear another Shiite-dominated state in the region. \"What they do not want is an Iranian-run state on their southern border,\" CNN military analyst Lt. Col. Rick Francona said of the Saudis. The airstrikes did not include warplanes from the United States, which has worked with Yemeni governments -- including that of recently deposed but still battling President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi -- to go after al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In fact, a senior official in President Barack Obama's administration said \"there will be no military intervention by the U.S.\" But U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday did tell foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman that the United States commends the military action and is supporting it through intelligence sharing, targeting assistance and logistical support, according to a senior State Department official. How did Yemen get to this place? Houthi supreme leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi spoke live Thursday night in Yemen on al-Masirah TV, saying, \"If any army try to invade our country, we will prove that Yemen will be a grave for those who invade us.\" He added, \"We call on the invaders to stop the attacks and if the airstrikes do not end then we will escalate in the needed manner.\" Iran denounced the military intervention. Marzieh Afkham, a spokeswoman for the country's Foreign Ministry, said the operation will throw an already complicated situation into further turmoil and disrupt chances at a peaceful resolution to Yemen's monthslong internal strife. It also won't help a region already facing terrorist threats from groups like ISIS and al Qaeda, she said. \"This is a dangerous action against international responsibilities to respect countries' national sovereignty,\" Afkham said, according to a report in Iran's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. Iraq -- 60% of whose citizens are Shiite, with about 20% being Sunnis -- offered similar, albeit a bit more muted opposition to what its Foreign Ministry called \"the military interference of the Gulf Cooperation Council,\" which is made up of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. \"We call on the Arab states to live up to their role to support national dialogue (that includes) all political forces to find a political solution for the crisis,\" the Iraqi ministry said. The Houthis are a minority group that has emerged as the most powerful player in Yemen. In addition to airstrikes, the Saudi adviser said 150,000 troops could take part in an operation in Yemen. Just a day in, the coalition airstrikes are already costing the Houthis. Hundreds of explosions ripped through Sanaa overnight, said journalist Hakim Almasmari, who is staying in the capital. The Health Ministry reported 18 dead and 24 wounded in Sanaa, the Houthi-run Saba news agency said. While Sanaa was a focus -- airstrikes destroyed the Houthis' combat and control operations there, the Saudi adviser said -- it wasn't the only place struck. Compounds and military installations in Saada and Taiz also were targeted. By Thursday afternoon, the Saudis controlled Yemeni airspace, the adviser said, and the military threatened to destroy any naval ships trying to enter Yemeni ports. The military operation, dubbed al-Hazm Storm, was launched after the Houthis rebuffed an initiative by the Gulf Cooperation Council, Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi said in a speech Thursday. It was done in accord with a joint Arab defense treaty, al-Arabi said. Specifically, the strikes aim to support Hadi, who was ousted in January after talks with the Houthis faltered, but still claims to be Yemen's rightful leader. \"We are determined to protect the legitimate government of Yemen,\" said Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, in announcing the beginning of the military campaign. \"Having Yemen fail cannot be an option for us or for our coalition partners.\" Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen? Jubeir told CNN's \"The Situation Room With Wolf Blitzer\" that Saudi Arabia was concerned that the Houthis had control over Yemen's armed forces ballistic missiles and air force, and the fact that Iran backs the Houthis was troubling. \"This is really a war to defend the legitimate government of Yemen and protect the Yemeni people from takeover by a radical militant group aligned with Iran and Hezbollah,\" he said. American military commanders said they didn't know about Saudi Arabia's action until the last minute. \"We have been discussing this matter with the United States in principle for many months,\" Jubeir said. \"We have been discussing this matter in more detail as the time approached and the final decision to take action didn't really happen until the last minute, because of circumstances in Yemen.\" Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry on Thursday proposed a joint Arab military \"to deal with these challenges.\" But at least one major player in Yemen besides the Houthis -- the General People's Congress, which is the party of longtime leader Ali Abdullah Saleh -- thinks the Saudis and their partners should stay out. The GPC says the airstrikes have already led to civilian casualties. The best way to stop the bloodshed is to bring everyone to the negotiating table, the group said. \"The (party) expresses its rejection of the attack on the Republic of Yemen and the capital, Sanaa, considering what (is) happening is an internal affair,\" the GPC said. \"... The General People's Congress (calls on all parties) to return to and accelerate the completion of a national, historic agreement that ... maintains unity and democracy.\" Meanwhile, the last person to be elected president of Yemen -- even if he was the only one on the ballot -- is out of the country and will soon be headed to Egypt to petition Arab officials, according to Yemeni officials. The location of Hadi had been a mystery for days, with conflicting reports about whether he'd left Yemen and where he'd gone. Saudi Arabia's state news agency, SPA, reported that Hadi arrived Thursday in Riyadh, where he met with the Saudi defense minister and intelligence chief. But two Yemeni officials close to Hadi said that the deposed president is in Oman. They said that his next stop, on Friday, will be an Arab League summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Meanwhile, some 3,000 to 5,000 troops from the Saudi-led coalition are expected to reach Aden, the Yemeni city that was Hadi's last known location, in the next three days, according to the officials. Their aim is to make that port city safe enough for Hadi to return after the Arab League summit. Whether the rest of Yemen will be secure at that point is another matter. Unfortunately, there has been little in the last few months to inspire optimism that peace is around the corner. Opinion: Why Yemen has come undone .

{"article":"(CNN)One of the two University of Oklahoma students expelled for their role in leading a racist chant has issued an apology, The Dallas Morning News reported. \"I am deeply sorry for what I did Saturday night. It was wrong and reckless. I made a horrible mistake by joining into the singing and encouraging others to do the same,\" Parker Rice said in a statement printed by the newspaper. Earlier Tuesday, Rice and another student were expelled over their alleged \"leadership role\" in a racist chant by Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity members, a decision that President David Boren says speaks to his school's \"zero tolerance\" policy for such \"threatening racist behavior.\" The decision comes two days after a video of frat members singing a racist song surfaced and hours after Boren told CNN he would suspend or expel the group's ringleaders if at all possible. \"At this point, all I can do is be thoughtful and prayerful about my next steps, but I am also concerned about the fraternity friends still on campus. Apparently, they are feeling unsafe and some have been harassed by others. Hopefully, the university will protect them,\" Rice reportedly said in his apology. Already, the Greek letters sigma, alpha and epsilon have been removed from the frat house's facade, the house will be closed as of midnight Tuesday and the university will board up the windows, following up on separate decisions by the university and the SAE national headquarters to shutter the Oklahoma chapter, Boren said. Fraternity's house mom sings n-word . Rice has not responded to multiple requests from CNN for comment. \"For me, this is a devastating lesson and I am seeking guidance on how I can learn from this and make sure it never happens again. My goal for the long-term is to be a man who has the heart and the courage to reject racism wherever I see or experience it in the future,\" his apology read. It was only a nine-second clip, but the backlash has been disastrous. Party-bound students are seen on a bus clapping, pumping their fists and laughing as they chant, \"There will never be a ni**** SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me. There will never be a ni**** SAE.\" After the campus organization, Unheard, and the school newspaper received the clip via anonymous messages and publicized it, the university and the fraternity's national chapter acted swiftly to shutter the SAE house in Norman. Boren promised the university's affiliation with the fraternity was done. \"I was not only shocked and disappointed but disgusted by the outright display of racism displayed in the video,\" said Brad Cohen, the fraternity's national president. \"SAE is a diverse organization, and we have zero tolerance for racism or any bad behavior.\" Still, it could get worse. Oklahoma may not be the only source of embarrassment for the fraternity. \"Several other incidents with chapters or members have been brought to the attention of the headquarters staff and leaders, and each of those instances will be investigated for further action,\" SAE said. It's likely that if the university hadn't acted, the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division could have stepped in, said Barbara Arnwine, president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \"prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance,\" according to the Justice Department. In this case, Arnwine said, the university likely found that fraternity members appear not only to have discriminated in their membership -- and backed that discrimination with the threat of lynching -- but they've also created a hostile environment. The university, she said, \"would've been compelled to do something to sanction and prevent this fraternity from engaging in racial discrimination.\" Arnwine said she wasn't personally familiar with the school's code of conduct, but she'd be surprised if the fraternity members' actions weren't in violation of university rules as well. All of these reasons are grounds to sanction the fraternity and expel specific members who were involved in the singing, she said. \"A very important part of the lexicon of civil rights law is that you cannot create a hostile environment where you make it so people of different races or religions or women feel they can't function at your institution without being subjected to unlawful discrimination,\" she said. It's unclear whether more students will be punished for the video, though Boren has promised the SAEs won't return during his tenure if he can help it. \"The house will be closed, and as far as I'm concerned, they won't be back,\" he said at a Monday news conference. He later told CNN, \"There seems to be a culture in some of these fraternities, and it just has to be snuffed out.\" The decision to shutter the fraternity was an easy one for Boren, he said. \"If we're ever going to snuff this out in the whole country, let alone on college campuses, we're going to have to have zero tolerance, and we have to act right away,\" said Boren, a former Oklahoma governor and U.S. senator. \"This is not a place that wants racists or bigots on our campus or will tolerate it, so I think you have to send a very strong signal.\" Hundreds of students have protested the fraternity's actions. Some of them arrived Monday morning on the campus' North Oval with tape over their mouths, while the Oklahoma football team and Coach Bob Stoops marched arm in arm across campus instead of practicing. The video infuriated Oklahoma linebacker Eric Striker, who posted a profanity-laced video to social media. \"I was angry and I was outraged,\" Striker said. \"I apologize for the profanity, but I'm not apologizing about how I felt, because that's how I felt in my heart.\" The fallout from the video also cost the football team a top recruit as offensive lineman Jean Delance said Monday he was de-committing from the Sooners and considering other teams. Just as they protested loudly Monday, students on Tuesday were emphatic in expressing their relief and satisfaction that those allegedly responsible for leading the racist chant got their due. Ross Johnson, a senior studying drama and broadcast media, called the video embarrassing and unacceptable as he worried that it may be seen as a reflection on him in the future. \"It sucks that I'm graduating in May. I feel I am probably going to have to explain this when I move,\" he said. \"For people who don't know the University of Oklahoma, aren't part of the student body, it's a black eye that doesn't really deserve to be there. It's a small group of people who were acting foolishly.\" Another student, junior Jake Hewitt, applauded the university and the fraternity's national president for their handling of the incident. \"I think it's really good that the president is showing strong support for the students in the community here and saying, 'This is not OK. It's not going to be acceptable on our campus.' It's a good strong move, and I hope if they find out more, they do more,\" he said. Shortly after the expulsions were announced, senior Omar Humphrey, an African-American modern dance student, told CNN, \"I think it's rightfully so that they were (kicked out). ... That needed to happen. It wasn't  fair; it wasn't right. I am, as most of the student body -- not just the African-American students -- we're all disheartened by the situation. It's just really hard to think that this is still going on today, and I'm still deeply saddened.\" He is still a \"proud student,\" he said, and he understands that the fraternity members in question represent \"just some microbial infestation that's on campus. It's  on every campus, it's on every campus. It's unfortunate that we have to be seen in that light.\" Asked what he could say to the fraternity members if given the chance, Humphrey replied, \"I pray for their humanity. I hope that they find maturity. ... I wish them well. \" Unheard co-director Chelsea Davis said a racist mentality is not new to campus and is not confined to one fraternity. \"Unfortunately, it took them getting caught on video camera for this to happen, but this is definitely not something that is brand-new. It's not something that's only seen within this one organization,\" she said. Sigma Alpha Epsilon is no stranger to scandal and sanctions . Davis said the only acceptable response is to expel -- not suspend, as that would send the wrong message -- all the students involved. \"I was hurt that my fellow peers that I walk to class with every day, people that I see every day, could say such hateful things about me and my culture, about my friends, about my brothers and my sisters,\" she said. William Bruce James II, who was a member of the frat between 2001 and 2005, called the episode \"devastating\" -- not just because he's an Oklahoma alumnus but also because he's African-American. James told CNN that there was \"never an inkling of this song or a whisper of anything like this\" when he lived in the house. He said members of his pledge class \"wouldn't let that happen,\" and if someone did dare to start such a chant they'd swiftly speak out and shut it down \"whether I was there or not.\" Since the video surfaced, James said he's heard from many of his former fraternity brothers. Like him, they're offended and supportive of the decision to shutter the Norman chapter. \"I don't know what happened to the culture of my home,\" he said. \"That is not my home. That is not SAE. They are not my brothers.\" Opinion: Are frats 'a form of American apartheid'? CNN's Brian Carberry, Chuck Johnston, Nick Valencia, John Couwels, Greg Botelho and Ed Payne contributed to this report.","highlights":"\"It was wrong and reckless.

{"article":"It took a full and frank exchange of views to rejuvenate Nir Bitton\u2019s Celtic career. The Israeli midfielder has emerged as one of Ronny Deila\u2019s key players this season. A likely candidate for a lucrative future transfer. Yet the penny took time to drop. Omitted from the Celtic manager\u2019s early first-team squads, a conversation between the pair became unavoidable. Israeli midfielder Nir Bitton has become a key player for Celtic after struggling to adapt at first . The Norwegian talked. Bitton listened. Crucially, he also learned what it would take to salvage his Celtic career. \u2018I prefer the conversation between me and the gaffer to stay between me and him,\u2019 said Bitton. \u2018But at the beginning of the season there were a couple of things I didn\u2019t understand in terms of what he expected from me. \u2018Sometimes you need a conversation with the gaffer to understand what he wants from you. To understand what he expects from you as a player and a professional.\u2019 Bitton needed a conversation with manager Ronny Deila before the penny finally dropped for him . The temptation for any player out of the team is to blame the coach but Deila told Bitton to look a little closer to home. Speaking in recent weeks, the Celtic boss said: \u2018If you put everything on the coach then you are lost, you are finished. \u2018You have to go into yourself and ask \u201cWhy am I not playing? Why is that guy in front of me?\u201d and when you find that out you have to think \u201cOK, what do I do to get better?\u201d \u2018It\u2019s not the other way around, that the coach gives you a chance and then you play well. \u2018You have to show in training that you are good enough and then you get your chance, and Nir has done that.\u2019 Pushed on the issue, Bitton will plead guilty on all counts. \u2018Of course I had to look at myself,\u2019 he admitted. \u2018When you don\u2019t play the first thing you say is: \u201cIt\u2019s the gaffer.\u201d 'That\u2019s what everybody says. \u2018But after you go home you think honestly: \u201cOK, what am I doing wrong?\u201d \u2018I understood that I needed to change myself, that I needed to improve. It\u2019s difficult sometimes to be honest if you have the wrong attitude. But if you want success you must change to do things the way the gaffer wants. \u2018I said to myself, if I don\u2019t change I will find myself out of this club. \u2018It\u2019s not easy when you are not playing so you need to have a good attitude and a strong mentality \u2014 you need to show the gaffer you want to change.\u2019 Bitton is keen to play in the Scottish League Cup final this weekend, but is struggling with injury . In his first season there were glimpses of promise, yet he admits the culture shift and weather were difficult to negotiate. \u2018This is one of the reasons it was hard last season. In Israel, 80 per cent of the days are 24 or 25 degrees. Then you come to Scotland and... it\u2019s not quite the same.\u2019 His wife is in Glasgow now and, with regular games, he has adapted to Scottish football to a point where Charlie Mulgrew faces a battle to resume his midfield partnership with Scott Brown. Learning to press and harry was one of the aspects he had to improve, conceding: \u2018The gaffer wants to play a certain way. \u2018Before I thought, \u201cOK, I\u2019m a good player, I don\u2019t need to change everything. If the gaffer wants me to play he will, if not I will sit on the bench, I don\u2019t care\u201d, stuff like that. \u2018But everyone wants to play. You can train 10 times a day but it\u2019s not the same.\u2019 The midfielder has had some swelling on his ankle, after suffering an injury against Dundee United last week . With the inhospitable climate and culture the Israeli admits he could have returned home. Or tried his fortunes elsewhere. \u2018The easiest thing would be to not care and just go back to Israel and not want to be here any more,\u2019 he added. \u2018But that\u2019s not me. I just want to show everyone I deserve to play.\u2019 The battle ahead of Sunday\u2019s League Cup Final is of a different kind. Bitton suffered ankle swelling against Dundee United in the Scottish Cup last weekend and is fighting to prove his fitness for Hampden. \u2018I still have another four days. We will see. \u2018At the end of the day I will take the final decision. \u2018If I feel I can play and help the team I will play. \u2018If I feel I can play but not at 100 per cent I will take the decision to protect it for the next games. But we have four more days before the game and that\u2019s a long time. I hope I will be fine.\u2019 Bitton has admitted that it took some time to adapt to life - and the weather - in Scotland . The opportunity to win his first domestic trophy at the national stadium as a Celtic player beckons. Yet he is adamant he won\u2019t put his own interests before those of the team adding: \u2018I have to be honest with my team-mates. If somebody cannot give 100 per cent for the team there is no reason he should play. \u2018If I can give 100 per cent I will play. If not I will be ready for the next games.\u2019 Sunday marks the first step towards a Treble Deila has very publicly and vocally targeted. The norm is to talk down domestic clean sweeps to lessen expectations, yet Bitton accepts that \u2014 whatever people say in the public domain \u2014 the onus is on Celtic to win everything. \u2018Of course it\u2019s hard. \u2018Everybody just expects us to win all the titles. But everybody saw the game on Sunday and it will be very difficult for us. \u2018We all need to do our jobs as well as we can. But we don\u2019t think about what they say outside the club, we just need to play our game. If we do we can do it.\u2019","highlights":"Israeli midfielder struggled after moving to Scotland this season .\nNir Bitton failed to make Ronny Deila's first team at first .\nBut after frank discussion with manager Bitton went away to change game .\nYoung midfielder is now a first team regular for Celtic ."}

David Petraeus remains a trusted adviser to the White House on its strategy in Iraq, despite being convicted of leaking classified information to his mistress and biographer, then lying to the FBI. The National Security Council and Obama administration have been consulting with Petraeus on matters related to Iraq and ISIS, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest confirmed on Monday. Earnest did not elaborate how long Petraeus has been advising the White House since his fall from grace, but Newsweek reports the retired four-star general has been in the role since last summer. \"Gen. Petraeus is somebody who served for a number of years in Iraq. He commanded a large number of American military personnel in that country,\" Earnest said. \"He is, I think, legitimately regarded as an expert, when it comes to the security situation in Iraq. So I think it makes a lot of sense for senior administration officials to, on occasion, consult for him advice.\" Once considered a possible presidential candidate, Petraeus plead guilty to one federal charge of removing and retaining classified information earlier this month as part of a plea deal approved by Attorney General Eric Holder. According to court documents, Petraeus admitted removing several so-called black books -- notebooks in which he kept classified and non-classified information from his tenure as the commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan -- and giving them to his biographer, Paula Broadwell. After he resigned from his CIA post in 2012, Petraeus told the government he had no classified materials in his possession. That claim turned out to be false as the FBI found the notebooks when they conducted a search of Petraeus' house in 2013. When he was questioned by the FBI at the time, he lied and claimed he never provided classified information to anyone not authorized to have it, according to court documents. Earnest says he is unaware of any particular security precautions put in place by the White House when it consults with Petraeus, despite his legal problems and lack of CIA security clearance. Petraeus is currently the chairman of a global institute for private equity firm KKR.","highlights":"The Obama administration has consulted with Petraeus on matters related to Iraq and ISIS .\nPetraeus plead guilty to one federal charge of removing and retaining classified information earlier this month ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Modern women are suffering from an energy crisis. Competing in the workplace, caring for aging parents and trying teenagers, and busier than ever, we use anything we can to duct-tape our lives and ourselves together: comfort foods, alcohol, energy drinks, and an expanding array of antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds, painkillers and amphetamines. All in an effort to maintain our unnatural pace. Welcome to the increasingly altered states of America. Americans are about 5% of the world's population, yet we take half its pills, and 80% of its painkillers.This over-medication has led to record numbers of opiate overdoses and also to a growing number of women taking antidepressants -- one out of four and counting, according to a report issued by the pharmacy benefit manager, Medco. This is creating a \"new normal,\" bringing closer the tipping point for when other women will seek chemical assistance. Like steroids in baseball, when everyone starts doing it, the players who don't are at a disadvantage. The overuse of psychiatric medication is called cosmetic psychopharmacology, and it's like cosmetic surgery: as more women get breast implants, the rest of us feel flat chested. But the new normal isn't normal at all. Certain antidepressants called SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) create artificially stable and elevated levels of serotonin, the brain chemical that helps regulate mood, which can dampen empathy and emotional reactivity, while higher doses can engender apathy. Women are naturally moody. Our moods change, and this emotional fluidity helps us to be adaptable and resilient. We are dynamic and responsive to our environment. There is a biological advantage to this sensitivity; we need to know what our nonverbal babies need, what our mates are thinking and to sense danger in our surroundings. Moodiness -- being sensitive, caring deeply and occasionally being acutely dissatisfied -- is actually a natural source of power. It helps to ensure not only our survival, but that of our offspring. Women's emotionality is a sign of health, not disease, and it is our single biggest psychological asset. Yet many of us are being convinced to medicate it away. The pharmaceutical industry spends billions in payments to physicians and direct to consumer advertising. Nine out of 10 pharmaceutical companies spend less on research and development than marketing.Steady doses of antidepressant advertising aimed at women advance the question from \"Should I take an antidepressant?\" to \"Which one should I take?\" These medications can have more far-reaching effects than most people realize, blunting empathy, passion, and sensitivity. SSRIs dampen sexual desire and response, making it difficult to climax and interfering with the evaluation of potential romantic partners. SSRIs also make it hard to cry, an important signal to ourselves and those around us that something is very wrong. Tears, and the emotions beneath them, can offer a profound lesson in how people's behavior affects others. We cry when we're touched by the poignancy of humanity, or when we're angry, or frustrated by injustice. And yet, women apologize for their tears, especially in the workplace, where we've been socialized to shut down expressed emotion; it interferes with our typical agenda of forward-momentum, and it makes people uncomfortable. The problem with shutting it down is that we're stifling a piece that we need, that our partners and families need, and that society needs, particularly as women continue to ascend to the upper reaches of business and government. The world needs more compassion, sensitivity, intuition and empathy. War, rape, murder, and corporate malignancy will flourish in their absence. Change comes from discomfort -- and awareness that something is wrong. Sadness and fear are not always symptoms to be medicated. Anxiety and tension come foremost from the denial of emotions, from their repression. My patients want to feel better, but really what many of them need is to get better at feeling. The shame that for centuries has been used by our culture to separate men from their true feelings is now spreading to women, who, by their biology, are the last and much needed connection to this natural place. As we embrace new technologies, we need to be careful that we don't go too far away from nature and what's natural for us as social primates. We insist on all natural products in our baby food and household cleaners. Why don't we insist on natural moods for ourselves? If we can live in a way that is more aligned to what is genuine for us, we will be calmer, more at peace and more fulfilled. But we are drowning in artificiality. There is a \"plastic vortex\" of garbage the size of Texas floating in the Pacific Ocean, synthetic fillers in our breasts and faces, virtual sex partners on our computers and artificially enhanced rationality from serotonergic antidepressants. We compulsively consume this fakery without satiation or satisfaction, because it is impossible to fill up on something that is almost enough. We need a course correction, away from the synthetic, so that we can live lives that honor how we feel. But to do that, we must be able to feel, to be our moody, authentic selves. That is the first step to wellness and to wholeness. Medicating yourself into complacency may leave you unshaken, but it also may leave you unfeeling and apathetic, making it impossible to address the causes of your pain.  Don't put the alarm on mute.","highlights":"Julie Holland: American women taking too many anti-depressants, blunting their valuable emotional reactivity, creating new normal .\nShe says anti-depressants dampen moodiness, but it's healthy, useful for women to be moody.

{"article":"(CNN)His satire took Egypt, and the world, by storm. But now, Bassem Youssef -- Egypt's most famous satirist known as his country's Jon Stewart -- has the public profile of a politician in retirement, leading study groups at the Harvard Kennedy School. \"Well, you know, sometimes circumstances are not the best for you to continue a political satire show,\" Youssef told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an interview that aired Monday. \"Sometimes jokes kind of are annoying.\" His show -- literally called \"The Show,\" or \"Al Bernameg\" -- ran for three seasons during Egypt's turbulent and utterly confusing post-Arab Spring days. Youssef's biting satire left nothing unscathed -- whether the president, political and militant Islam, or the military. \"There is room for satire and comedy as long as it's acceptable by the people controlling the atmosphere.\" His incredible story from cardiac surgeon to satirist to political target is the subject of a documentary currently in production, directed by a senior producer for Stewart, with whom Youssef developed a close relationship. \"It's talking about political satire, humor, how (people can) be all for a certain program or a joke, but when the joke turns on them, they kind of like turn on you,\" he said. \"And so maybe we were an equal opportunity satirist, but they were not (an) equal opportunity audience.\" The chances are small that his show would be allowed back on air, if he even wanted to do so -- \"The question is will I be allowed to do, make fun of whatever (I want)?\" (\"Who said that my country's authoritarian? Come on,\" he joked. \"I mean, don't put words in my mouth. We are -- it's a very, very good, democratic country; please, please.\") But he is far from idle, seemingly casting around for ways to occupy his immense talent. At Harvard, he is a visiting fellow working on \"political satire and humor, and how they interact with political, social and even religious taboos.\" He is careful not to say he is teaching, as \"Harvard professors are very touchy when resident fellows come here and say they teach.\" He is also writing a script for a movie comedy, and building a platform to identify talent in the Arab world and allow more people to experience the extreme and unexpected success he did. \"Satire didn't begin or end with my program. I mean, it is a part of people's culture, a part of people's thoughts. So if one program is off, there are people who will find other ways.\" His program showed the Arab world in a new light for many in the West, and he said he hopes more will follow in his footsteps. It's a counterbalance, if you will, to the messianic image propagated by ISIS. \"I don't want to even call them extreme Muslims. I think they are a bunch of lunatics, who instead of playing 'Grand Theft Auto' on video games, they want to do it in real life.\" It may not often reach a Western audience, but Youssef said that YouTube is filled with Arabs making fun of ISIS -- for example, setting the group's favorite \"anthems\" to images of belly dancers. \"It happens with all religions ...,\" he said. \"So they are crazy, and they are a threat for me as much they are a threat to you.\" Despite all Youssef's projects, many simply want him to return to the airwaves. Is he eyeing, Amanpour asked, the seat that will soon be vacated by his mentor, Stewart? \"The day that I actually have been chosen to replace Jon Stewart will be like -- it will be glorious,\" he said. \"But I don't think that Americans would like to take their political satire from a Middle Eastern guy with a thick accent. I think this is going to be even more difficult than electing a black president. \"But you know, let's hope.\"","highlights":"Bassem Youssef is a visiting fellow at Harvard working on \"political satire and humor\"\nEgypt's Jon Stewart had program that ran for three years in post-Arab Spring days .\n\"There is room for satire and comedy as long as it's acceptable\" by those in control, he says ."}
{"article":"(CNN)When food giant Nestle USA (to which I am, alas, not related) last month announced plans to remove all artificial flavors and colors from its chocolate candies, it understandably made headlines. According to the company, by the end of 2015, none of a group of 250 chocolate products including Butterfinger and Baby Ruth will contain artificial flavors or colors such as Red #40 or Yellow #5. With the expectation that these chemicals will also disappear from the company's other candies, it looks like the end of the use of artificial flavors and colors in anything but the cheapest food products. If that proves to be the case, it will be a welcome shift. Nestle USA intends to advertise the reformulated products with a \"No artificial flavors or colors\" claim on package labels. If sales of the \"no artificial\" candies grow as expected, the company will surely extend the removal to all of its other colored and flavored food products. After all, Nestle's international parent company -- and the company's competitors -- will have to take notice and find ways to remove these chemicals from all their product lines. Nestle USA has undeniable clout. It accounts for a quarter of the $100 billion in annual revenues of the more than century-old, privately held parent corporation, which itself is the largest food company in the world. This move surely will not only reverberate through the candy industry, but also affect every other major food company. In substituting natural for artificial flavors and colors, Nestle USA is responding to what its customers are saying. The company's own research indicates that Americans prefer their beloved candy brands to be free of artificial flavors and colors, while other surveys find majorities of respondents saying that artificial chemical additives negatively influence their buying decisions. 7 chemicals in your food . Nestle is also responding to decades of complaints from consumer advocates about the potential health risks of these chemicals, especially the dyes. Studies in experimental animals have linked high doses of food dyes to health problems, among them organ damage, cancer, birth defects, and allergic reactions. In humans, studies link food dyes to hyperactivity and other behavioral problems in young children. The credibility of these studies and their implications for human health remain hotly debated. In the 1970s, for example, Ben Feingold, a physician in California, suggested that food additives caused children to become hyperactive. Much of the evidence for the \"Feingold hypothesis\" rested on anecdotal reports by parents, whereas double-blind, controlled clinical trials produced contradictory results. On the basis of current evidence, some artificial food dyes have been banned, while others remain in use despite suggestions that they too might be harmful.  But the makers and users of food dyes argue that the chemicals are safe at current levels of usage. As a result of all this, and in the absence of convincing evidence of their safety, the advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest has campaigned since the 1970s to remove food dyes and other chemicals from foods, and has continued to petition the Food and Drug Administration to ban them. Kraft removing artificial dyes from some mac and cheese . The opposing views complicate the regulatory status of food dyes. But after one clinical trial reported that dyes induce hyperactivity in half the children studied, the British government asked companies to stop using most food colors; the European Union requires a warning notice on many foods made with them. In the United States, the FDA does not permit artificial food dyes to be used unless the manufacturers can meet safety requirements. But the amounts of these substances in the country's food supply have greatly increased in recent years -- soft drinks, breakfast cereals, frozen desserts and even salad dressings all contain artificial coloring agents. True, the FDA considers a dye to be safe if there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from its intended use. But that standard is vague enough to cause concern. Given the unresolved scientific questions, it is reasonable to ask why artificial colors have to be in foods at all. From the standpoint of manufacturers, such additives are essential for covering up and hiding unattractive colors in processed foods. To the public, red candy seems to taste better than the drab variety. And while natural colors exist, they are less stable or more expensive to produce. But for Nestle to have taken the action that it has, the company must have found substitutes it can live with. And appealing to consumers' preference for \"natural\" makes good business sense. The truth is that whether artificial colors do or do not cause health problems in adults or children, they are there strictly for cosmetic purposes. For that reason alone, getting rid of them is a good idea.","highlights":"Nestle USA plans to remove all artificial flavors and colors from its chocolate candies .\nMarion Nestle: Consumers pushing for less additives ."}
{"article":"(CNN)There are superyachts. And then there are superyachts for \"ladies.\" Introducing La Belle, the 80-meter gold and crystal-encrusted superyacht described as a floating \"boudoir for women,\" by its female designer. \"There will not be any boy's toys -- such as pool tables or beer kegs -- on board,\" Italian designer, Lidia Bersani, told CNN. \"But there will be a fantastic spa with a beauty center, large mirrors, and huge wardrobes,\" she said of the concept yacht, which she claims is the first designed specifically for women. Bersani came up with plans for the five-deck La Belle because \"I felt, as a lady, it was my duty to design something especially for us, where we can feel a woman's touch. \"There will only be off-white, ivory, and cream colors. All surrounded by furs, silk, gold, pearls, crystals, live music, aromatics and flowers,\" she added. Not that all women are on board with Bersani's \"warm and romantic\" bejeweled boat. \"I don't know any woman who lives in a dream world where these things are desirable,\" said Maria Jaschok, director of the International Gender Studies Centre at Oxford University. \"It feels somehow remote, like some sort of little girlish dream, traveling in that eternal pink cloud.\" Bersani, who also designs apartment interiors, defended the hyper-feminine yacht, saying: \"I don't know a single woman who does not like flowers and is not dreaming of diamonds. \"If you get married, the most amazing day in your life, you want to be dressed in an amazing white long dress, looking like a princess, with a gold diamond ring on your finger, around romantic music, happy people, and plenty of flowers.\" In the ultra-elite world of superyachts, female owners are practically unheard of, but that doesn't mean women don't have a huge influence over the spending of their billionaire partners. \"In terms of superyacht owners, I'd say they were upwards of 90% male,\" said Rory Trahair, of superyacht brokers Edmiston. \"That said, superyachts on the whole are designed for the preferences of a couple -- for their interests, design, style, and taste. \"And while the person chartering a superyacht is often male, the person in charge of the holiday is often his wife or girlfriend.\" Male or female, Trahair envisioned few clients looking to buy a \"radical, gold yacht\" such as Bersani's. \"It could be regarded as patronizing -- a bit like Barbie, where the assumption is that everything has to be pink,\" said Trahair. Earlier this year, plans were revealed for world's biggest private boat -- the $1 billion, 222 meter Triple Deuce. And they're only going to become more lavish, according to Trahair. \"We've launched yachts in the last few years that have multiple pools, helipads, a squash court. There are few things now a yacht can't have,\" he said. \"Whereas a jacuzzi was a luxury in the early 2000s, now if you've got just one, it's rather frowned upon. You need to have a few and you need to have an infinity plunge pool that doubles as a helipad.\" Whether there will also be a market for gender-specific vessels, remains to be seen.

{"article":"(CNN)Adi Shankar had the idea for \"Power\/Rangers\" when he was 7 years old. \"This was before the Internet, and my access to TV and video games was pretty limited,\" the producer recalled Thursday, in the midst of the \"Power\/Rangers\" frenzy. \"So all you really had was (to) tell people stories. So I'd tell people 'Captain Planet' stories, and then I started telling them these dark 'Power Ranger' stories. \"And I got into trouble,\" he added. \"Because the parents were like, 'This guy, he's ruining our children!' \" That was more than 20 years ago for Shankar. But the producer, now 30, got his wish when his dark version of the \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,\" directed by friend Joseph Kahn, made it online -- and proceeded to rack up more than 11 million views on YouTube in less than two days. Fans buzzing over bloody 'Power\/Rangers' 'bootleg' In some ways, Shankar is still getting into trouble. Not only did the video explode the Power Rangers mythology, showing the impact of serving as \"child soldiers,\" in Shankar's phrase, but the video became a legal football after the owner of the franchise, Saban Entertainment, claimed infringement. First it was taken down from Vimeo and then YouTube. However, it was reposted in both places late Friday after lawyers reached agreement, Deadline reported. Among the additions: a disclaimer from Shankar that his \"bootleg\" is \"my take on the FAN FILM. Not a pilot, not a series, not for profit, strictly for exhibition. This is a bootleg experiment not affiliated or endorsed by Saban Entertainment or Lionsgate nor is it selling any product. I claim no rights to any of the characters (don't send me any money, not kickstarted, this film is free).\" Saban Entertainment has its own plans to reboot the popular '90s franchise with a theatrical film scheduled for 2016. 'An interesting experiment' So who are these guys, anyway? Kahn is a famed music video director, probably best known for Britney Spears' \"Toxic,\" Eminem's \"Without Me\" (for which he won a Grammy) and Taylor Swift's \"Blank Space.\" He's also handled a number of commercials and the films \"Detention\" and \"Torque.\" Shankar is a producer of such films as \"The Grey,\" \"Killing Them Softly\" and \"Dredd.\" This isn't the first time he's made a \"bootleg\" short. Previous videos have included one featuring Marvel's Punisher character and one drawing from Marvel's Venom character. In a Reddit AMA, Kahn said that \"Power\/Rangers\" was \"self-funded.\" A special effects house, Ingenuity Engine, \"worked six months on this and took a bath financially,\" he added. Shankar declined to give a budget for \"Power\/Rangers,\" which was shot over a few days last year, but says it was mainly financed through favors and the principals' money. \"It was all favors,\" he says, noting that star James Van Der Beek \"is one of my best friends.\" The film also starred \"Battlestar Galactica's\" Katee Sackhoff. Both Shankar and Kahn like to subvert concepts and cliches. Kahn said he was drawn to \"Power\/Rangers\" because \"it was an interesting experiment to play with reboot culture and tone control. ... I didn't come into it to please a fan base, per se, but to experiment with pop culture.\" And Shankar? Even his look tries to upset stereotypes. In the video he made to explain \"Power\/Rangers,\" he's wearing eye makeup like the 1970s Alice Cooper, a look he adopted \"because I don't want to be (an Indian) stereotype,\" he told CNN. 'Kind of a war brewing' Shankar comes by his outlook honestly. The Indian-born producer had an itinerant childhood thanks to his father's job, traveling frequently -- various Indian cities, China, Singapore -- before moving on to the next place. He came to the United States at 16. He says he thinks of his childhood as \"jarring,\" with the only constants comic books, movies and television. \"Just moving around so much, literally every two years,\" he said. \"I didn't feel like I had a friend until I was 18. If you're moving to a different school, let alone a different country every couple years, it's kind of jarring as a kid.

{"article":"(CNN)Last summer, amid startling news reports of manipulation, mismanagement and possibly death caused by failures at the Department of Veterans Affairs, Congress came together and passed legislation to overhaul veterans' access to health care. I was proud to sponsor the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014 (the Choice Act), and deliver good news to veterans: They would have a choice when it comes to accessing health care they deserve, and many would have the option of seeing their local physician. Now, the VA is trying to take the choice away. A mere six months after the Choice Act was signed into law, and only three months after veterans began to receive their Choice Cards, the President's budget attempts to reallocate the law's emergency funds that are solely meant to pay for veterans' health care in their communities. The VA says these funds aren't being used quickly enough because veterans aren't interested in getting care from their local physicians. That could not be further from the truth. Thousands of veterans are struggling to access the care they were promised through the Choice Act because of the VA's flawed implementation of the law and foolish interpretation of the 40-mile rule in the distance criteria. When Congress passed the Choice Act, the intent was that veterans be allowed to access local health care if they cannot receive the VA care they need within 40 miles of their home, or their wait time for an appointment is more than 30 days. Unfortunately, the VA decided to narrow the interpretation of the 40-mile rule, choosing to take into account only the distance of a VA medical facility from a veteran's home and not whether the VA facility can actually provide the services the veteran needs. Veterans are being told they cannot use their Choice Cards because they live within 40 miles of a VA facility, even though that facility does not offer the care they require. The VA is denying the access the law was intended to provide and forcing veterans to choose between traveling hours to a VA medical facility, paying out of pocket or going without care altogether. Veterans simply want what they were promised in the Choice Act: the choice to access the care they deserve in their community. In my hometown of Hays, Kansas, a veteran is forced to drive 200 miles several times a month for routine cortisone shots because the VA outpatient clinic just 25 miles from his home does not offer the shots he needs. One would think this veteran could use his Choice Card to visit a local physician or local hospital to get the shots he needs -- but the VA is denying access to this care. Thousands of veterans across the country are facing this same frustration. Why is common sense not prevailing at the VA? Why is the VA not bending over backward to take care of veterans? As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have questioned VA Secretary Bob McDonald and other VA officials for months in hearings, personal meetings, phone calls and correspondence about the VA's flawed interpretation of the 40-mile rule and what can be done to fix the problem. Congress specifically included language in the Choice Act that gives the VA the authority and flexibility it needs to provide veterans with access to care outside the VA when the care needed by a veteran is \"either unavailable or not cost-effective to provide at a VA facility.\" But for some reason, the VA refuses to use the authority Congress gave it and put the best interest of veterans first. Enough is enough. In the absence of VA action, I authored legislation that would make certain veterans are not dismissed or forgotten just because of where they live. The Veterans Access to Community Care Act of 2015 (S. 207) would require the VA to utilize its authorities, including the Choice Act, to offer community care to veterans who are currently unable to receive the health care services they need from a VA medical facility within 40 miles of where they live. This legislation enjoys broad bipartisan support in Congress and has been endorsed by numerous veterans' organizations, including the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, AMVETS, Vietnam Veterans of America and the National Guard Association of the United States. When Congress passed the Choice Act, we called on the VA to live up to its commitment to care for those who have sacrificed for our country -- and we will not back down. We ought to always err on the side of what is best for the veteran, not what is best for the Department of Veterans Affairs.","highlights":"Veterans' Choice Act was signed into law in August 2014 .\nJerry Moran: VA is denying the access the law was intended to provide ."}
{"article":"(CNN)With the passing of Leonard Nimoy, fans worldwide mourned the loss of the legendary performer who gave life to the Vulcan first officer on Star Trek. As Spock, Nimoy touched audiences with his commitment to the principles of science and logic, and his embrace of \"infinite diversity in infinite combinations.\" Nimoy's portrayal has inspired generations to pursue careers in space, science and technology, to embrace the uniqueness of others, and to appreciate the same in themselves. It is difficult to measure the impact of Nimoy's iconic role, particularly on the science and technology communities. For decades, many of the best and brightest inventors, explorers and engineers have credited Star Trek with sparking their imaginations. For many, Spock holds a sacred spot as not only one of the most beloved characters in all of science fiction, but the earliest example of Star Trek's enduring legacy of inspiring innovation in the real world. Spock first appeared on our television screens in 1966 with the premiere of the original Star Trek series. Since then, the show has earned a reputation for predicting future technologies with remarkable accuracy. At a time when the computer age was only just beginning and the idea of handheld communication devices or tablet computers were fantasies of a far-off future, Spock could be seen working with many of these technologies aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise. As we soon discovered, his incredible tools and gadgets weren't so distant after all. Soon, we moved closer to realizing these devices in our own world with the development of the integrated circuit. Portable and handheld computers were suddenly possible, and some scientists turned to Star Trek for inspiration as they sought to design the next wave of modern marvels. One such scientist was Martin Cooper, inventor of the first mobile phone, who has credited the handheld communicators used by Captain Kirk and Spock as the source of his inspiration. Even though Cooper's original cellular telephone wasn't as compact as Spock's, and most consumers couldn't afford one for some time, it wasn't long before they would become ubiquitous in our world. The same is true for the handheld computers Spock used to record scientific data. About the size of a notepad, and sometimes equipped with a stylus, these handy gadgets would go on to appear in every incarnation of the Star Trek franchise. They are known as PADDs \u2014 Personal Access Display Devices \u2014 and it's hard to ignore their influence on the the real thing. From their design and function to the name of today's most popular tablet computer, Spock may well have been the first iPad user. Another technological wonder that first appeared in Spock's hands was known as the tricorder. This mobile scanning device could be used to take readings while on an away mission to an alien planet. This data might include atmospheric conditions, radiation levels, or even the chemical composition of an object. The version Nimoy used on set was bulky and had to be worn with a shoulder strap. However, tricorders would soon become one of the most versatile and sought-after pieces of Treknology. Today, our smartphones can deliver many features of the Tricorder, while more specialized scientific and medical instruments are able to duplicate some of the more advanced scanning capabilities. It wasn't just computers and productivity gadgets that Spock brought to life on screen. He was often a proponent of passive resistance and non-violent solutions. Along with his fellow crew mates, he presented us with new ideas like weapons \"set to stun\" that formed the core of the Star Trek ethos. As we still wrestle with violence in our world, today's scientists and law enforcement are working toward breakthroughs in non-lethal weapons in an effort to prevent unnecessary loss of life. The original Star Trek series predicted or even inspired these and many other technologies in only three seasons on television. Of course, the franchise would continue this tradition with four more television series and twelve movies. Over the course of nearly 50 years, Star Trek has given us many more ideas that we've realized, like touch-screen and voice-control computer interfaces, and others we haven't quite mastered yet. Tech concepts like the universal translator, the holodeck, the replicator and, of course, the transporter hold the potential to radically change our world \u2014 and they might not be as far off as we think. Our iPhones and tablets have made touch screens commonplace, and we can communicate with Siri or Google through voice commands just like the computer on the Enterprise (though maybe not as effectively). We can instantly connect with others across great distances and even across language barriers thanks to recent advancements like Microsoft's Skype Translator technology. Meanwhile, 3D Printers allow for on-demand fabrication of many objects, and immersive virtual reality devices may soon make holographic adventures as common as video games. Scientists have even been able to transport particles of matter across distances, perhaps taking the first steps toward transporting people through space one day. As we say goodbye to Leonard Nimoy, let us remember him not only for his work as an actor on Star Trek, but for his remarkable role in the world of science and technology. Through Spock, Nimoy challenged us to understand our human nature, including our scientific curiosity, and in the process helped inspire countless men and women to reach for the stars. This is one more way that Nimoy will be remembered, in the hearts and minds of so many scientists, helping us all to \"live long and prosper.\"","highlights":"Star Trek actor Leonard Nimoy died Friday, age 83 .\nAnthony Rotolo: It's difficult to measure the impact of Nimoy's role ."}
{"article":"A woman who says she was conned out of \u00a350,000 by her Senegalese husband in a immigration marriage scam wants to help other women avoid the same fate. Kim Sow, 58, from Dover, has been calling for the government to take action since her husband Laye walked out on her after obtaining his British citizenship. She alleges that Laye had been in the UK illegally and she now believes he was already married to at least two other women. Kim Sow appeared on today's This Morning to share her story of how she was 'duped by a love rat' Kim, pictured with Laye, believes he married her to gain her assets and British citizenship . Kim, a music producer was 49 when she first met Laye, then 43, in a London nightclub in 2007. She said there was an 'instant attraction' and their romance had a 'normal progression to a full-on relationship'. He told her he was a widower supporting three young children in Senegal. Kim said she had no reason not to believe him as he even had his wife's death certificate to prove it. 'He said he was a religious man so couldn't live with me if we weren't married. He told me he didn't believe in polygamy and didn't do affairs. 'He told me his wife had died and his children were being cared for by relatives and he had paperwork to prove it,' she told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden on today's This Morning. Kim, who was unable to have children after an ectopic pregnancy left her infertile, said the prospect of having a ready-made family with Laye was a dream come true. She said: 'When we married, I thought his children would come and live with us.\u00a0I was so happy. 'One of the attractions for me was that I couldn't have children. I was thrilled to be marrying a man with three lovely children, they were the apple of my eye. I spoke to them on the phone and sent them presents, they were my life. 'I even bought a five bedroom house in Dover where we could live as a family.' Kim and Laye married at Kingston registry office in June 2008. 'I was the happiest woman in the world thinking I had a family and it all came crashing down,' Kim said. The music producer told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden, left, that she had no reason to believe Laye was still married as he showed her his wife's death certificate . 'I found out he'd had an affair and he said it was because he was missing his children. I gave him a second chance but then found all these other layers of lies and secrets. 'It was all thanks to Facebook that I discovered his real story.' Using the social network site, Kim said she discovered Laye hadn't lied about the death of his first wife, with whom he had one child. But he had gone on to marry another woman in Africa with whom he had his two other children. She found evidence he had then married a Dutch woman and possibly another English woman - and appeared to have ripped them off in similar circumstances to his dealings with her. She also found Facebook messages from Laye to other women he was targeting on dating websites. At the end of her interview, Phillip pointed out charges have not been made against Laye since he left Kim. Following Kim's allegations, police have begun an investigation into Laye for bigamy, fraud and associated crimes. But it is unclear if he is still in Britain. Kim remains adamant he is a 'love rat' who has left her poorer and broken-hearted. Kim is now working with\u00a0Immigration Marriage Fraud UK to stop others suffering her fate . On This Morning she said she knows people will think she's a fool for being taken in but she said she had done lots of checks away to ensure Laye was who he said he was. 'I don't have imbecile on my forehead,' she said. 'I had checked his paperwork and it had gone through lawyers, embassies and the registry office. I had met him in the UK.'

{"article":"Lausanne, Switzerland (CNN)As nuclear talks with Iran neared the endgame, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry shied away from predicting success. Difficult issues remain on the table as the world's most powerful diplomats meet in Switzerland with Iranian nuclear negotiators, Kerry told CNN on Monday. \"We are working very hard to work those through. We are working late into the night and obviously into tomorrow. We are working with a view to get something done,\" he said. \"There is a little more light there today, but \u200bthere are still some tricky issues. Everyone knows the meaning of tomorrow.\" Negotiators have set Tuesday as their deadline for a basic deal. A comprehensive deal, including technical additions, is supposed to be negotiated by June 30. World powers are seeking the outlines of an agreement they say would stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon for at least 15 years. In exchange, Iran would get out from punishing sanctions that have crippled its economy. Kerry's comments to CNN came after uncomfortable rumblings about the talks in Lausanne, Switzerland, made headlines. The assertion: Iran backpedaled the day before on an important detail of a possible deal to prevent it from developing a nuclear bomb. On Sunday, an Iranian negotiator told journalists that Tehran would not send fissile material to Russia, which diplomats had earlier told journalists was part of the plan to put potential bomb-making materials out of reach. \"The export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our program, and we do not intend to send them abroad. ... There is no question of sending the stocks abroad,\" Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said. But on Monday, a senior U.S. State Department official said the rumblings in the press should quiet down. Negotiators had not yet decided any specifics about the disposal of fissile material, and Iran has made the comments many times before, the official said, citing a list of previous examples of such statements in press reports. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi sounded optimistic as he briefed reporters on the talks' progress earlier Monday, saying that the diplomats were \"narrowing down\" their differences and working out ways to resolve sticking points. \"These marathon-like negotiations have reached the final stage,\" he said. Things have been tense in Lausanne as the deadline for an agreement looms, with talks snagged on three important points: . \u2022 How quickly or slowly Iran will be allowed to advance its nuclear technology in the last five years of the 15-year agreement. \u2022 How quickly crushing U.N. sanctions will go away. \u2022 Whether sanctions will snap back into place if Iran violates the deal. Iran wants them gone for good. But international negotiators want merely to suspend them, so they can reapply them as leverage if Iran does not keep the bargain. Agreement on the points is crucial, a Western diplomat said. \"There cannot be an agreement if we do not have answers to these questions,\" the diplomat said. In the background, a vocal critic of a possible deal spoke out again. Over the weekend, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the deal he believes is taking shape. \"This agreement as it evolves is fulfilling our deepest fears and even worse,\" he said after a meeting in Israel with visiting U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Netanyahu also attacked Iran for its support of Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have overtaken many parts of that country. He said Iran was trying to take over the whole Middle East with the nuclear deal and its influence in Yemen. Conservative Washington lawmakers are threatening new sanctions if Tehran doesn't comply with demands, which could throw a wrench into negotiations. U.S. negotiators are working to reach an agreement in part to prevent this kind of congressional punishment. They fear it could prompt hardliners in Tehran to push for killing the talks, which would scuttle the chances of a deal altogether. Aside from the three tough points, negotiators on both sides have shown optimism. U.S. officials have said most of the other elements were solvable if those three major hurdles could be overcome. Iran's Araghchi agreed. \"Getting to an accord is doable. Solutions have been found for numerous questions,\" he said. Iran would like sanctions lifted as soon as a deal is signed. But diplomats says it's not so simple. Iran could see unilateral sanctions relief in the areas of trade, oil and banking, but sanctions adopted by the United Nations are more complicated. Many are related to proliferation and transfer of missile technology and are tied to certification by the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, that Iran's nuclear program does not have a military dimension. On Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif showed some optimism about finding a path through the deadlock. He said he believes the world powers \"have realized that sanctions, pressure and an agreement will not go together. It's only to translate that understanding and realization into the agreement that we are negotiating.\" U.S. officials said that all sides, including Iran, agree that sanctions would be lifted in phases over time as Iran confirms its compliance to the deal. But they acknowledge there is still disagreement on the actual formula. Iran also wants to be allowed to develop more advanced centrifuges while the deal is in effect. New machines would enrich uranium much faster than current machines. U.S. and European officials worry that could enable Iran quickly to produce enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon. Diplomats say the first 10 years of the 15-year deal would have the most stringent restrictions, which would be relaxed over the last five. \"We are not asking them to do nothing (in technology development), but they want to do more than we want them to do,\" a Western diplomat said. But the diplomat added, \"After 15 years, they can do what they want.\" Diplomats said Iran has agreed to a cap of fewer than 6,000 centrifuges that it can operate to enrich uranium. That figure is down from the 6,000 the sides were speaking about when the talks started Thursday, but substantially more than the several hundred the United States had originally wanted. Iran currently runs about 10,000 centrifuges, but it has around 19,000 in its stockpile. U.S. officials maintain the number is not that important, because there will be other restrictions on the levels of enrichment and type of centrifuges Iran can operate, which they believe will extend the time Iran would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon -- known as the \"breakout time\"  -- to at least a year. While the focus this week is on the March 31 deadline, it's important to note it isn't the final deadline. Even if a pact is reached Tuesday, it's unclear what form it would take, and the United States and Iran have varying needs. The parties are seeking to reach what's being called a framework agreement -- essentially a political understanding of the main principles of the final deal. But if they're able to come together on the big issues, they still have until the end of June when the Joint Plan of Action expires to iron out the details. So that means the talks won't be finished this month. Officials have been vague about the format this framework deal might take as well as how much of it will be made known to the public and international stakeholders. The United States would prefer a written accord, but Iran has balked at putting anything in writing until a comprehensive deal is reached. U.S. officials say they will need to quantify Iran's commitments before submitting the agreement to Congress. But U.S. and Western diplomats say that Iran is looking simply for an \"understanding\" of what has been agreed to before a formal accord is reached. CNN's Jim Sciutto, Nimet Kirac and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","highlights":"China's foreign minister says \"marathon-like negotiations have reached their final stage\"\nSecretary of State John Kerry: \"We are working with a view to get something done\"\nPotential snags to talks include how quickly sanctions on Iran would be lifted ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Sen. Harry's Reid's perfunctory announcement on Friday that he won't seek re-election next year -- leaving a vacancy for leadership of the Senate Democrats -- was followed, hours later, by a matter-of-fact statement in an interview with The Washington Post: \"I think Schumer should be able to succeed me.\" That would usher in a whirlwind of activity on Capitol Hill in the next year as New York's senior senator prepares to seize the reins of power -- and retool the party as a center-left powerhouse that can win and hold a majority in 2016 and beyond. Left-leaning activists have begun scrambling to block Chuck Schumer's rise. The progressive organization Democracy for America is calling for Sen. Elizabeth Warren to seek the leadership post, and the left-leaning Daily Kos website is circulating a poll seeking other challengers and denouncing Schumer as too close to the \"Wall Street wing\" of the Democratic Party. With more than a year to go before Senate Democrats will choose a new leader, anything can happen. But after watching Schumer in action for more than 20 years, I'd be surprised if he gets outsmarted in a political moment he has literally been working for a generation to create. With more than $13.4 million on hand in his campaign coffers, Schumer has more money than all but one member of the Senate -- and is the only Democrat in the top 10 in that category. He ran the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee when it took the majority in 2006 -- and while Democrats lost the majority during his second stint in the job in 2012, the field looks far more promising for them in 2016: Republicans must defend 24 seats, while Democrats need to protect only 10. Schumer brings an extraordinary level of personal political skill to the leadership fight. Even among the 100-member Senate -- home to a great many ambitious politicians with big egos -- Schumer has long operated at a high-octane level of smarts and media-savvy brashness that impress and occasionally startle his colleagues. Republican Bob Dole, a longtime lion of the Senate, once quipped that the most dangerous place to be in the Capitol is between Schumer and a television camera. The joke stuck -- but behind the gag is a sign of grudging respect for a man who excels at the basic block-and-tackle necessities of political life. Schumer is attuned to television and radio (growing up in the world's media capital will do that). In fact, he popularized a practice of holding press conferences on Sunday, a slow news day guaranteed to draw reporters -- and ensure him prominent placement in the Monday newspapers. But he is also a consummate street politician: At 64, he maintains a habit of biking around New York City neighborhoods without fanfare or an entourage, quietly noting local problems and occasionally inviting himself into a block party or parade. When a reporter once casually asked him to name all 62 counties of New York state, Schumer did her one better, and hand-sketched a map of the state with all the counties filled in. (He visits every county in the state every year.) Schumer isn't the only politically ambitious kid from Brooklyn -- before attending Harvard, he graduated from a public school, James Madison High, whose alumni include Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sen. Bernie Sanders and ex-Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota (a childhood pal of Schumer's). But Schumer's political climb been a long-term work in progress. He emerged on the national stage as a prime sponsor of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, a law that banned assault weapons; in the run-up to the final vote, New Yorkers practically couldn't turn on television without seeing Schumer, then a congressman, on the floor of the House, waving a rifle over his head as he argued for the ban. The higher profile served him well a few years later, when Schumer took on -- and defeated -- three-term incumbent Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. As a senator on the rise, Schumer attracted politically ambitious staffers who moved on to high-profile positions where they can help their former mentor. A very partial list of those includes Howard Wolfson, Phil Singer and Blake Zeff, who went on to help run Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign; Ben Lawsky, who is now shaking up the world of finance as New York's top banking regulator; Preet Bharara, who has become an anti-corruption powerhouse as a U.S. attorney; and Rodney Capel, who is executive director of the state's Democratic Party. With allies, money and the blessing of Reid, Schumer is in a prime position to implement the ideas contained in his important and overlooked 2007 book, \"Positively American,\" which lays out a vision for how Democrats should lead America. Like Schumer himself, the book is savvy, hopeful and politically attuned to the desires of middle-class voters. Those who wonder what a Schumer Senate leadership would look like should take a look as Democrats prepare for what could well be the start of the Schumer era on Capitol Hill.","highlights":"Harry Reid wants Chuck Schumer to succeed him as Senate minority leader .\nErrol Louis: But some on left want to block Schumer's rise to leadership post .\nLouis says Schumer is tuned into middle-class voters, could create new Democratic era ."}
{"article":"(CNN)There are many things that immigrants could teach those of us who are U.S.-born. The biggest lesson may simply to be grateful for our rights and privileges. That includes the little things we take for granted. Like a small plastic card that not only allows us to drive on public roadways but also provides us a sense of identity. Imagine not having a driver's license and not being able to obtain one because the government prohibits it. Erika Andiola doesn't have to imagine. Until recently, the 27-year-old Phoenix resident and co-director of the Arizona Dream Coalition was barred from having a driver's license by Arizona. The reason: she is an undocumented immigrant born in Mexico and brought here as a child by her mother. Given that she arrived in the United States when she was 11 and has lived on this side of the U.S.-Mexico border longer than she lived on the other side, Andiola considers herself an American and this country her home. Under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which was initiated by the Obama administration, more than half a million undocumented youth were given a two-year reprieve from deportation and a work permit. Andiola is one of the recipients, having been granted DACA protection in November 2012 and a renewal since then. From that point, had she lived in another state, the process for getting a driver's license might have been much smoother. But she lives in Arizona, which -- in the 20 years from 1989 to 2009 -- welcomed illegal immigrants and their labor to build homes in Phoenix, work in restaurants in Tucson and make beds at ski lodges in Flagstaff but then tried to expel them when their chores were done. To push them out the door, legislators passed a spiteful law in 2010 that roped local police into enforcing federal immigration statutes and essentially sanctioned ethnic profiling of Latinos. In August 2012, on the same day that DACA took effect, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer issued an executive order preventing the program's recipients from obtaining driver's licenses or other public \"benefit.\" Brewer's order was challenged in court. Two years later, in July 2014, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the Arizona policy as a violation of the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. With that, the estimated 22,000 DACA recipients who are also residents of the Grand Canyon State were free to apply for driver's licenses and take their driving tests like anyone else. Andiola got her Arizona license earlier this month, after paying a $25 fee that she'll have to pay every two years each time she renews it. I wondered what traveling that road taught her about that piece of plastic she carries with her. And I was curious about whether she had given any thought to how the native-born see driver's licenses compared to people like her. \"There is a pretty big difference,\" Andiola said. \"I think it's because we fought really hard for it. People born here might not ever think about their driver's license unless they buy a drink or get stopped by police. For us, it's a reminder of the fruits of our labor. Think about how many minds we had to change so people could come out of the shadows.\" Other privileges get taken for granted by the native-born, she said, such as the ability to apply for financial aid to attend college or pay the lower in-state tuition that you're entitled to pay as a state resident. \"When it comes to higher education, I don't think a lot of people really understand what they have unless they have to struggle to get it,\" Andiola said. \"I have nephews who are citizens. I'm trying to make them understand how it was such a big deal, in my case, to attend college and pay in-state tuition and have it taken away. It was a big hurdle, and I almost dropped out. I want them to understand some of the privileges they have.\" Finally, there's the right to vote. Undocumented immigrants can't do it, and yet many of those U.S. citizens who can don't bother going to the polls. \"Look at what we've done to bring change,\" she said. \"Imagine how much someone can accomplish when they vote. A lot of Americans don't learn the political process. And you don't feel you need to until you struggle to drive, to vote, to just be allowed to stay with your family.\" Listen to her, America. This is an exemplary country, and it'll stay that way as long as those of us who were born here and have these rights and privileges learn to appreciate them, treat them with care and put them to good use.","highlights":"Ruben Navarrette: A driver's license is not only about transportation but about identity .\nHe says it took a hard fight for young immigrants to win the right to driver's licenses in Arizona ."}

{"article":"It was a weekend when Andy Murray was full to bursting with emotion, but he struck a note of pragmatism after leading Great Britain to Davis Cup victory. The din of what is the closest he can get to a home-town crowd was still ringing in his ears as he considered the implications of a 3-2 victory over America - one that has again put Leon Smith\u2019s squad into the last eight of the sport\u2019s premier team competition. Wimbledon\u2019s host nation may not be able to raise a quorum when it comes to volume of players in the world\u2019s top 100, but where there is Murray, there is hope. Andy Murray celebrates as his win over John Isner leads Great Britain into the Davis Cup's last eight . Murray celebrates during his straight sets win over Isner that clinched the Brits a quarter-final place . Murray produced the right results in points at key moments to overcome the fancied American . He showed that again as he held off a ferocious challenge from 6ft 10in John Isner to win 7-6, 6-3, 7-6 and push Britain into a July quarter-final against France. Yet he was cautious about whether that could actually lead to GB winning the Davis Cup for the first time since 1936. \u2018To win the event is an extremely difficult thing to do,\u2019 he said. \u2018Even with someone like Federer, such a great player, it\u2019s taken him to have a top five in the world partner (Stan Wawrinka) to help him to do that. We\u2019re playing at the limits of our level right now.\u2019 If he was merely being realistic there was not, after all, a great deal of time for heady celebration. Such are the demands of the tour that he was flying back to London on Sunday night and then flying on Monday morning to Los Angeles for the season\u2019s first Masters level event at Indian Wells. Accompanying him will be James Ward, without whom none of this weekend\u2019s triumph would have been possible. Murray was the star but this was truly an Anglo-Scottish enterprise at a time when such things are under threat. James Ward turned the tie in Great Britain's favour with his own victory over Isner on Friday . Ward took the first two sets in the dead rubber against\u00a0Donald Young but retired to protect his knee . Ward\u2019s Friday night epic against Isner turned this match in the home side\u2019s favour - just as he had 13 months ago in the corresponding first-round match against America, when he defeated Sam Querrey. The 28-year-old Londoner is one of those players who grows an extra three inches in the team environment, but it is expecting a lot of a player outside the world\u2019s top 100 to keep the upsets coming. Ward even took the first set against Donald Young in the dead rubber after Murray\u2019s victory on Sunday but then conceded the match to protect his sore knee. When asked about his side\u2019s potential, Smith said: \u2018We have still got a bit of work to do but we are getting closer. We can trouble most teams. You\u2019ve seen the spirit we have.\u2019 The victorious Great Britain team smile with clenched fists after their 3-2 win over the United States . The Brits gather on the court after their win which sets up a clash with France in the quarter-finals . This was another triumph for Smith. In an era when big-name ex-players are all the rage as coaches, he continues to land blows for the lower-profile professional. For the second consecutive time he has got the better of former world No 1 Jim Courier in the captain\u2019s chair. Murray is not only among the planet\u2019s best tennis players, he has also shown what a team man he is this weekend with his passionate support from the sidelines. If there is a worry, it is that it may all have sapped him. It helped that the 7,700 capacity crowd was intent on dragging him over the line. No wonder the debate over the next month will be whether the advantage of grass in the next round is outweighed by the passion of playing in Scotland on a hard court. Murray, embracing GB team captain Leon Smith, praised the 'effort and attitude of everyone in the team' Great Britain captain Smith celebrate as their talisman Murray wins a crucial point against World No 20 Isner . Murray said: \u2018I knew that James was extremely tired and I knew it would be a very tough ask for him to come out and win that match (yesterday\u2019s final singles) after me. There is pressure to help your team-mates out and I wanted to try and finish the tie there. \u2018I was very emotional all weekend \u2014 it is quite draining. I was proud of the team, the way they performed and fought in this arena under so much pressure.\u2019 Isner was desperate to make amends for Friday and had come out swinging in the first set against Murray, backing up his enormous serve with early strikes in rallies designed to prevent any long exchanges. He forced seven break points en route to the tiebreak including three set points at 5-4, which saw him taking huge cuts at Murray\u2019s more vulnerable second serve. What it came down to was Murray\u2019s greater sangfroid in the tiebreak, which Isner began with a double fault. That first set settled the nerves of Murray and the crowd and he broke for 4-2 in the second with an exquisite lob \u2014 no mean feat against a giraffe-like opponent. To Isner\u2019s credit, he kept fighting. But the second tiebreak followed much the same pattern as the first and was sealed 7-4 with a swinging ace which met with a cacophony that nearly blew the roof off. It was the kind of supreme effort from Murray that is all too easily taken for granted. Big American Isner fell to Murray after\u00a0James Ward come from two sets down to beat him in an epic tussle . Isner took responsibility for the loss saying 'This one's on me' after his loss to Ward . Isner, however, says there were ew players in the world who could have conquered Murray in Glasgow .","highlights":"Andy Murray beat John Isner in straight sets to secure GB win over US .\nMurray's GB team-mate James Ward had before upset world No 20 Isner .\nThe Scot said GB are playing at their limit having moved into the last eight .\nGreat Britain will face France at home in the quarter-finals in July ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Chelsea's good week continued when the Blues beat West Ham 1-0 in the English Premier League to maintain a five-point lead over Manchester City atop the table. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho -- who picked up another trophy Sunday in the League Cup final -- had never lost to West Ham in the top flight and Belgian attacker Eden Hazard ensured three more points when he netted in the first half Wednesday at the Hammers' Upton Park. \"The game was very difficult,\" Hazard told Sky. \"One big battle against a good team with very good players. \"It's always difficult when you don't score the second goal to kill the game. But one goal was enough. It's not always like this. \"The goalkeeper, the defense we have are very strong. It was very good.\" Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois made a string of good saves in the second half but West Ham boss Sam Allardyce lamented his team's finishing -- plus the refereeing. He felt Hazard's goal was offside. \"When you look back on the season and they say these things even themselves out, that's the biggest load of rubbish I've ever heard,\" the under pressure Allardyce told Sky. Nigel Pearson, manager of last-place Leicester, also felt aggrieved after his team lost 2-0 to reigning league champion Manchester City. Leicester didn't get a penalty when City striker Wilfried Bony appeared to foul Jeff Schlupp in the  box in the first half or when Fernando fouled Andrej Kramaric in the second. Leicester struck the woodwork, too. City -- reeling following back-to-back defeats to Barcelona in the Champions League and Liverpool -- only really came to life after David Silva's opener in first-half stoppage time. Leicester's veteran keeper Mark Schwarzer thwarted City to keep it close but could do little on James Milner's 88th-minute effort. The win was \"very important because it was a very difficult week with two bad results against Liverpool and Barcelona,\" said City manager Manuel Pellegrini, who rested club captain Vincent Kompany. Elsewhere, four teams vying for Champions League spots all won. Manchester United claimed all three points at Newcastle when Ashley Young took advantage of keeper Tim Krul's error in the 89th minute; Arsenal doubled third-last QPR 2-1; surging Liverpool shut out second-last Burnley 2-0; and League Cup finalist Tottenham defeated Swansea 3-2 in a game overshadowed by French striker Bafetimbi Gomis collapsing to the turf. United defender Jonny Evans might have been fortunate to escape unpunished at St. James' Park, since he appeared to spit in striker Papiss Cisse's direction when they clashed in the first half. Cisse then appeared to spit back at Evans. Arsenal remained third, with United in fourth on 53 points, two better than Liverpool, four better than Southampton and six better than Spurs, who have a game in hand. In Wednesday's other match, Stoke extended Everton's league slide by blanking the Toffees 2-0 at home. Barcelona reaches Copa del Rey final . In Spain, meanwhile, Barcelona reached the Copa del Rey final by easing past Villarreal 6-2 on aggregate. Holding a 3-1 lead after the first leg, Barcelona won away by the same score Wednesday, helped by Neymar's double. Barcelona faces familiar foe Athletic Bilbao in May's finale. Bilbao advanced 3-1 on aggregate over Espanyol, prevailing in the second leg 2-0. Barcelona topped Bilbao in the 2009 and 2011 finals.","highlights":"After winning the League Cup on Sunday, Chelsea triumphs in the league .\nThe Blues beat West Ham 1-0 to keep their five point lead over Man City .\nManchester City kept pace by defeating last place Leicester 2-0 .\nManchester United scored late to down Newcastle 1-0 ."}
{"article":"West Ham striker Carlton Cole has accepted a Football Association charge over a Twitter exchange with a Tottenham supporter. Cole had until 6pm on Thursday night to respond to the charge of making a comment which 'was abusive and\/or insulting and\/or improper and\/or brings the game into disrepute'. A FA independent commission will now meet to decide his sanction, with no limit to the possible punishment. West Ham United striker Carlton Cole has admitted an FA charge for a tweet that the FA deemed abusive . Cole tweeted back to a Tottenham fan who had insulted him on Twitter, telling the  supporter: 'F off you c***' The charge related to Cole's involvement in a Twitter altercation with a Spurs fan following West Ham's 2-2 Barclays Premier League draw at White Hart Lane on February 22. The 31-year-old, who has 122,000 followers on the social networking site, was responding to a message from Spurs supporter Stuart Hardy that read: 'Hi @CarltonCole1 when your own team-mates don't kick the ball out when you're lying injured for 2 mins, you think it's time to call it a day?' Cole replied: 'F off you c***' before later deleting the tweet. Cole could have left West Ham in January's transfer window but a move to West Bromwich Albion fell through . The former Chelsea striker has been in trouble before for previous postings on social media and this may be taken into account in his punishment. He was fined \u00a320,000 by the FA in April 2011 for a tweet he posted during England's friendly against Ghana that read: 'Immigration has surrounded the Wembley premises! I knew it was a trap!

{"article":"(CNN)A U.S. Air Force veteran who allegedly tried to join ISIS in Syria but was turned back by Turkish authorities before he could get to the war-torn country entered a not guilty plea to terror-related charges Wednesday in a federal court in New York. Tairod Nathan Webster Pugh, accused of making the foiled attempt in January, was indicted by a grand jury on charges of trying to give material support to the terror group and obstruction of justice, the U.S. Justice Department said in a two-count indictment announced Tuesday. Among the evidence, prosecutors allege: Investigators discovered on his laptop computer a letter saying he wanted to \"use the talents and skills given to me by Allah to establish and defend the Islamic States,\" and a chart of crossing points between Turkey and Syria, where ISIS controls some territory. Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West? Pugh, a 47-year-old convert to Islam and a former New Jersey resident who served in the Air Force from 1986 to 1990, was arrested upon his return to the United States in January, the Justice Department said. \"Pugh, an American citizen and former member of our military, allegedly abandoned his allegiance to the United States and sought to provide material support to ISIL,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney General John Carlin said, using an alternate acronym for the Islamist terror group that controls territory in parts of Iraq and Syria. At his arraignment Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, Pugh appeared in a black T-shirt and khaki pants and stated his name. He pleaded not guilty through his attorney, Michael Schneider. The defendant, a former avionics instrument system specialist in the Air Force, flew from Egypt to Turkey on January 10, weeks after being fired from a Middle East-based job as an airplane mechanic, U.S. authorities allege. Why is ISIS so successful at luring Westerners? But Turkey denied him entry. In the indictment, U.S. authorities said Turkey was likely suspicious Pugh was headed for Syria. Instead Turkish officials sent him on a return flight to Egypt, where he was detained. In Egypt, he was carrying multiple electronic devices, \"including four USB thumb drives that had been stripped of their plastic casings and an iPod that had been wiped clean of data,\" the Justice Department said in a statement. Pugh had purposefully tampered with the devices to prevent others from getting access to his electronic media, the indictment said. Pugh was deported to the United States, where agents with the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force obtained a warrant for his devices, including the laptop, the department said. Investigators found a letter from January addressed to a Misha, whom they believe is his wife, authorities said. In it, the writer says: \"I am a (mujahedeen). I am a sword against the oppressor and a shield for the oppressed. I will use the talents and skills given to me by Allah to establish and defend the Islamic States.\" In addition to that letter and the Turkey\/Syria border chart, agents also found recent Internet searches for information on \"borders controlled by Islamic state,\" as well as \"Internet searches for 'Flames of War,' an ISIL propaganda video,\" and \"downloaded videos, including one showing ISIL members executing prisoners,\" the Justice Department said. They also found what the government said was another 180 jihadist propaganda videos. Pugh was arrested in Asbury Park, New Jersey, on January 16. While in the Air Force, Pugh was trained in installing and maintaining aircraft engine, navigation and weapons systems, the Justice Department said. Pugh converted to Islam after moving to San Antonio in 1998, according to the indictment. The indictment said he took a job as a mechanic with American Airlines in or about 2001. The airline has not responded to a request for comment. In 2001, an American Airlines co-worker alerted the FBI that Pugh \"sympathized with Osama bin Laden, felt that the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies overseas were justified, and expressed anti-American sentiment,\" the complaint said. One year later, an associate told the FBI that Pugh had expressed interest in traveling to Chechnya to \"fight jihad.\" From October 2009 to March 2010, he worked in Iraq as an Army contractor for DynCorp, according to the complaint. According to Pugh's LinkedIn page, he listed himself as a maintenance manager for Gryphon Airlines, a Kuwait-based charter airline, since September 2014. But the airline told CNN that Pugh was only under consideration to work for it in 2014. \"In third quarter 2014, Mr. Pugh was under consideration for a future Gryphon project, but did not meet the qualifications,\" the airline said in a statement. \"Gryphon declined to hire Mr. Pugh. Gryphon personnel are cooperating with the authorities.\" His last known U.S. address was in Neptune, New Jersey, but he had lived in Egypt for about the last year, the indictment said. If convicted, Pugh could be sentenced to up to 35 years in prison. CNN's Ray Sanchez, John Newsome and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","highlights":"Tairod Nathan Webster Pugh enters not guilty plea to terror-related charges .\nPugh flew to Turkey on January 10, authorities say .\nAuthorities allege a letter on his laptop told his wife he was a mujahedeen ."}

The New Yorker said: 'I was shooting the typical city stuff such as rooftop views, buildings, cabs and bridges until one day I almost got arrested for roof topping. 'It was too much of a close call and it was getting too cold to continue to get these views so I asked myself what can I shoot in any weather and have access to all the time? 'This led me to the subway but I couldn't just capture it on a typical day - it had to be different so I decided to capture the stations empty. The carriage awaits for his model who is showcasing the clothes on board one of the trains . 'Photography has always been a hobby and a way for me to creatively express myself but now it is turning into a business. 'I take magazine commissions and anything business related which there is a budget for.' Clifton admits he often gets unusual reactions from fellow subway riders who happen to walk in on his shoots. He added: 'I get everything from guys smiling and wanting to talk to the models to people shocked and not understanding what is going on.' Aaron Pegg, who goes by the name of Clifton, has even been snapping the models with food on the subway system .

{"article":"(CNN)It's been more than 13 years since 2,753 people were reported missing in lower Manhattan after the attacks on the World Trade Center. Although death certificates have been issued for all 2,753, the work to identify each victim continues. In fact, it's far from over: Some 40% of the victims have not yet been identified, according to the city's Office of Chief Medical Examiner. The most recent identified victim is Matthew Yarnell, a 26-year-old New Jersey native who worked for Fiduciary Trust on the 97th floor of the South Tower. Yarnell's mother said Friday that the news \"was a bit of a shock,\"  but that it means that she can \"finally put everything to rest.\" \"It kind of opened up all of the old wounds and old pains initially,\" Michele Yarnell told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. \"I guess it kind of put to rest any -- I wouldn't say doubt -- (because) we weren't doubtful about the outcome, but it kind of gave us closure.\" According to the medical examiner, Yarnell's DNA samples were recovered during the original recovery effort from 2001 to 2002.  Until this week, they resided with other remains that have not been identified.

Bradford\u2019s Jon Stead hopes he can join them \u2014 and he\u2019ll be one step closer if he nets against Reading in their quarter-final on Saturday. Here are the fascinating stories behind the deadly dozen... Archie Hunter (Aston Villa, winners 1887) The Scot was one of the first footballing celebrities of the Victorian era. \u2018Old Warhorse\u2019 captained Villa to their first FA Cup with a 2-0 victory over West Brom at the Kennington Oval. Forced to retire in 1890 after a heart attack on the pitch, he later died of heart failure aged 35. Archie Hunter of Aston Villa was one of the first footballing celebrities of the Victorian era . Sandy Brown (Tottenham, winners 1901) Hailing from the same Ayrshire mining village as Bill Shankly, Brown was known as the \u2018Glenbuck Goalgetter\u2019. Spurs became the only non-League side to win the FA Cup thanks to his goals. During Brown\u2019s Scotland debut against England, part of the terracing at Ibrox collapsed, killing 25 fans. Sandy Brown (circled), pictured with Tottenham's FA Cup winning team, was a fine goalscorer in the cup . Harry Hampton (Aston Villa, winners 1905) \u2018The Whirlwind\u2019 remains Villa\u2019s all-time leading scorer in League football with 215 goals. He was a fearless forward and once scored having barged 22-stone goalkeeper William \u2018Fatty\u2019 Foulke over the line with the ball in his arms. He served at the Somme during World War One and survived a poisonous gas attack. Harry Hampton (circled) puts Aston Villa 1-0 up against Newcastle United in the FA Cup final in 1905 . Harold Blackmore (Bolton, winners 1929) Blackmore was a goalscoring sensation as a teenager playing for Silverton, a village team in Devon. He also worked at the local paper mill before signing for Exeter City and then moving to Bolton for \u00a32,150, a princely sum in 1927. It looked as though his chance of scoring in every round had gone as Bolton led Portsmouth 1-0 at Wembley, but Blackmore netted at the death to seal his place in history. Harold Blackmore signed for Bolton for over 2,000 and scored in every round of the 1929 FA Cup . Ellis Rimmer (Sheffield Wednesday, winners 1935) The Scouser was a showman, attracting big crowds as a jazz pianist. Left winger Rimmer was the first non-striker to score in every round after his late brace in the 4-2 win over West Brom. The England man later ran the Hallamshire House pub in Sheffield before returning to Formby, where he died aged 58. Ellis Rimmer was a showman for Sheffield Wednesday, and was the first non-striker to score in every round . Frank O\u2019Donnell (Preston, runners-up 1937) The Scot was one of 15 siblings and played in the final against Sunderland alongside brother Hugh, as well as Bill Shankly. O\u2019Donnell became the first player to score in every round but end on the losing team. He died 15 years later in Macclesfield aged just 40 after a short illness. A tribute in Glasgow\u2019s Evening Times described him as one of the finest players of his generation. Frank O'Donnell was in fine form for Preston in 1937, though his side lost the final . Stan Mortensen (Blackpool, runners-up 1948) Mortensen is better known for becoming in 1953 the only player to score a hat-trick in an FA Cup final. Five years earlier his side lost to Manchester United as he became the first post-war player to score in every round. A Blackpool legend, there is a statue of him outside Bloomfield Road. He died aged 69 in 1991, just nine days before Blackpool appeared at Wembley for the first time since the 1953 final. Stan Mortensen (second left, centre row) in a Blackpool team photo with Stanley Matthew to the left of him . Jackie Milburn (Newcastle, winners 1951) \u2018Wor Jackie\u2019 \u2014 cousin of Bobby and Jack Charlton \u2014 was Newcastle\u2019s top scorer until Alan Shearer broke his record in 2006. He scored both goals in the 2-0 victory over Blackpool in the 1951 final, defended the Cup in 1952 and scored after 45 seconds in the 1955 final win.

It was a final attended by Queen Elizabeth II. He did get his hands on the Cup after scoring in the 1958 final, when he barged Manchester United keeper Harry Gregg over the line, later admitting it was a foul.

Charlie Wayman (Preston, runners-up 1954) Wayman worked at Chilton Colliery in County Durham and served in the Royal Navy during World War Two. He was a team-mate of the great Tom Finney in the 1954 final as Preston were beaten 3-2 by West Brom and it was reported that his goal looked suspiciously offside. The pint-sized centre forward was a crowd-pleaser and it was a mystery how he never won England honours.

{"article":"(CNN)Ferguson's municipal judge has resigned and the city's court cases are getting moved after the U.S. Justice Department said the court discriminated against African-Americans. \"To help restore public trust and confidence in the Ferguson municipal court division, the Supreme Court of Missouri today transferred Judge Roy L. Richter of the Missouri Court of Appeals, Eastern District, to the St. Louis County Circuit Court, where he will be assigned to hear all of Ferguson's pending and future municipal division cases,\" the Supreme Court said in a statement Monday. \"Extraordinary action is warranted in Ferguson, but the court also is examining reforms that are needed on a statewide basis,\" Chief Justice Mary R. Russell said in the statement. The announcement came the same day Municipal Court Judge Ronald Brockmeyer resigned as Ferguson's judge. \"Mr. Brockmeyer recognizes that the Department of Justice report, as well as recent media reports, regardless of their accuracy or validity, have diminished the public's confidence in the Ferguson Municipal Court,\" his attorney Bert Fulk said in a statement. \"Mr. Brockmeyer believes that it is paramount to begin immediately on promoting the public's confidence in the Ferguson Municipal Court. Promoting the public confidence in the Ferguson Municipal Court will help Ferguson begin its healing process.\" The Justice Department's report said Brockmeyer approved the creation of additional fees, \"many of which are widely considered abusive and may be unlawful, including several that the City has repealed during the pendency of our investigation. These include a $50 fee charged each time a person has a pending municipal arrest warrant cleared.\" Just about every branch of Ferguson government -- police, Municipal Court, City Hall -- participated in \"unlawful\" targeting of African-American residents for tickets and fines, the Justice Department concluded. The millions of dollars in fines and fees paid by black residents served an ultimate goal of satisfying \"revenue rather than public safety needs,\" the Justice Department found. Document: Justice report finds systematic discrimination by police in Ferguson . Its report detailed how Ferguson operated a vertically integrated system -- from street cop to court clerk to judge to city administration to city council -- to raise revenue for the city budget through increased ticketing and fining. The investigators also found evidence of racist jokes being sent around by Ferguson police and court officials. One November 2008 email said President Barack Obama wouldn't likely be President for long because \"what black man holds a steady job for four years.\" Another email joked that African-American women should use abortion to control crime. \"Our investigation has not revealed any indication that any officer or court clerk engaged in these communications was ever disciplined,\" the Justice Department's report said.

{"article":"An ISIS-inspired teen in Tokyo has been caught 'practicing murder' with a junior school's pet goat, according to the Tokyo metropolitan police. The 14-year old boy, who can not be named for legal reasons, said he wanted behead the kid goat before he attacked a human victim after viewing videos of the recent killings of Japanese hostages by ISIS. Police in Tachikawa, a middle-class bed-town serving central Tokyo, said that the boy had been found attacking the goat with a crowbar at 1am in the morning on March 16. Victim: Inspired by watching horrendous videos of ISIS executions, a teenager in Tokyo tried to behead a goat (pictured) as 'practice' before attacking a human . Lucky escape: The boy was found attacking the goat with a crowbar at 1am in\u00a0Tachikawa, a middle-class town serving central Tokyo . Chilling inspiration: Police quoted the boy who tried to behead the goat (pictured) as saying: 'I wanted to murder somebody, anybody, after viewing videos of the Islamic State' Safe: The goat escaped any serious injuries and the boy - who is a minor - does not qualify for Japan's capital punishment laws despite calls on Twitter to give him the death penalty . Police said they were alerted to the assault when a passing police officer heard the repeated bleatings of the goat. The teen was caught chasing it and was found to be carrying a saw and other workman's tools. 'I wanted to murder somebody, anybody, after viewing videos of the Islamic State. But first I decided to kill the school goat for practice,' the police quoted the boy as saying. The attempt on the animal has parallels with another ISIS inspired attack in suburban Kawasaki, adjacent to Tokyo, earlier last month. Like the chief suspect in the Kawasaki murder, the goats' assailant was also a dropout, according to the police, and a 'hikikomori' a shut-in - common among the young in Japan. One of the three high school boys charged with stabbing a 12-year-old boy to death in Kawasaki proclaimed himself and the rest of his 'team' as the 'Kawasaki State' - following the same naming pattern as the terrorist organization ISIS. The gang terrorised other students in the port city declaring: 'We're above the law. We run by our own rules. We are Kawasaki State. If you go against us, we'll cut off your head while you're still alive!' Punishment: Police said the goat's assailant will be charged with trespassing and is now in the hands of Tokyo's juvenile court . Anger: In light of the attack on the goat, some have blamed Japanese parents for not knowing how to control their children's internet usage . The three are due to be tried for murder in a juvenile court later this year. Both the Kawaski murder and the attempt on the goat have generated thousands of tweets in Japan calling for the death penalty for minors in the case of heinous crimes. The perpetrators in both cases are all minors - under 20-years-old in Japan - and are not subject to the country's capital punishment laws. 'Murder must be punished by the death penalty whatever the age,' was one reaction. Other blamed Japanese parents who do not know how to control their children's internet usage because they are allegedly technologically illiterate. Violent viewing: The computer of the boy who attacked the goat contained videos of hostage beheadings - including those of Japanese hostages Kenji Goto (left) and Haruna Yukawa (right) Police in the Tachikawa case confirmed that the boy's computer showed a long history of downloaded videos of Islamic State beheading hostages - and that the suspect had viewed them repeatedly. The most viewed were the beheadings of two Japanese hostages in January - journalist Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa, a security contractor. Police said the goat's assailant will be charged with trespassing and is now in the hands of Tokyo's juvenile court. They added that the goat escaped any serious injuries.","highlights":"14-year-old boy in Tokyo was found attacking the goat with crowbar at 1am .\nBoy told police he wanted to 'murder somebody' after watching ISIS videos .\nPolice found footage of Islamic State beheading hostages on boy's computer .\nTwitter users want death penalty for minors who commit 'heinous crimes'"}

Dyke said last month, after FIFA's decision to play the World Cup in winter: 'The best option would be to not hold it in Qatar, but we are now beyond that so November\/December would seem to be the best of the bad options.' An FA source said Qatar's use of St George's Park was a commercial arrangement similar to visits by Spanish side Barcelona and Turkish giants Galatasaray last year and more recently Montserrat, and that all surplus income would be invested into grassroots football.

{"article":"Lewis McGugan would be open to signing a permanent deal at Sheffield Wednesday after manager Stuart Gray helped \u2018put a smile\u2019 back on his face. The attacking midfielder is on loan from Watford and has a decision to make in the summer, with one year left on his Vicarage Road contract. McGugan has scored three times and made four assists in his last eight games, setting up two goals in the dramatic late win at Rotherham on Saturday. Lewis McGugan has impressed during his loan spell at Sheffield Wednesday in recent weeks . McGugan in action for Watford last season . \u2018If Sheffield Wednesday and Watford can do a deal, then brilliant, but it\u2019s up to the clubs. I can only concentrate on playing well on the pitch,\u2019 McGugan told Sportsmail. \u2018At this point in time I\u2019m playing week in week out, I have a smile back on my face, and that\u2019s the most important thing. \u2018The manager has been fantastic for me, really straight. You know exactly what he wants from you. He gives you the platform to go out and perform and it\u2019s up to you to repay the faith.\u2019 McGugan says his spell at Hillsbrough has refreshed his enjoyment for the game after a difficult period at Watford under five different head coaches since joining in July 2013. He joined on a free from boyhood club Nottingham Forest and scored 11 goals in 37 games in his first season \u2013 but Gianfranco Zola\u2019s departure in December of that campaign altered the scene. Giuseppe Sannino came in before resigning last August sparking three changes in quick succession. Oscar Garcia was forced to vacate the role on grounds of ill health after four games, Billy McKinlay was sacked after two, and Slavisa Jokanovic has since steered Watford into automatic promotion contention. \u2018It was a chance to go and play under Gianfranco Zola which was a massive pull for me,\u2019 said McGugan. McGugan says he went to Watford to play under Gianfranco Zola but was 'shocked' after the Italian left . Playing time limited, he made his first loan move to Wednesday last November and signed again in the winter window. \u2018I could have easily sat there and seen what happens but you know when you\u2019re not really in someone\u2019s plans and I want to play football,\u2019 he said. \u2018Knowing this manager has 100 per cent faith in me to go out and perform can only build confidence. Hopefully I can have a strong end to the season and see what happens.' A number of clubs may be interested in McGugan come summer, and he did not rule out a switch back to Forest \u2013 even if sanctions limit his former club to loan deals. \u2018You never say never,\u2019 he said. \u2018Nottingham Forest was a massive part of my life and career. I made my debut at 17 and I left at the age of 24. It\u2019s where I\u2019m from. But the most important thing I can do is concentrate on performing.\u2019 McGugan has refused to rule out a return to former club Nottingham Forest in the summer .","highlights":"Lewis McGugan has scored three and made four assists in eight games .\nMidfielder has one year left on his contract at Watford .\nMcGugan refuses to rule out return to former club Nottingham Forest ."}
{"article":"If Eoin Morgan wanted to demonstrate that he is taking little notice of the outpouring of criticism that has greeted perhaps the worst of all England\u2019s many under-achieving World Cups then he made a good job of it. The unthinkable possibility of a first-round elimination will become reality if England lose to Bangladesh here on Monday, yet the England captain talked as if nothing has been learnt from three abysmal defeats. The subject of England\u2019s over-reliance on statistics has become the hot topic of a long week of introspection in Adelaide but Morgan does not seem to have noticed, judging by his first answer in Saturday's pre-match interrogation. Ian Bell of England takes a catch during an England nets session at the Adelaide Oval . England's Alex Hales takes a catch during an England nets session on Saturday . England know they can not afford a slip-up or even a rainy day as they prepare to face Bangladesh . \u2018Having a break has given us time to reflect and the analysis has come through which backs up our feel of what happened during the Sri Lanka game,\u2019 said Morgan. \u2018It makes things a lot clearer moving forward. It keeps it simple.\u2019 Well, to put it simply, England were thrashed by Sri Lanka in Wellington by nine wickets with 16 balls remaining, when 309 became not nearly enough. Does it need analysis to tell Morgan that England under-estimated what a winning score would be and then bowled like drains? Also, the key statistics in Gary Ballance\u2019s World Cup are 10, 10, 10 and 6, his scores since being parachuted in to the side at the expense of Ravi Bopara on the eve of England\u2019s first World Cup game against Australia. England warm up during a nets session at the Adelaide Oval where they will meet Bangladesh . Chris Jordan (left) is held back at the Adelaide Oval as he and his team-mates get prepared . Yet unless Morgan was being disingenuous to protect his man yesterday England, who tinkered with their team the day before the tournament, are now perversely going to be stubborn and again ignore the claims of Alex Hales. \u2018The decision we made to put Gary at three was a huge one,\u2019 said Morgan. \u2018There wasn\u2019t much between him and Alex at the time and it was just a feel we had. It is a big decision to change anyone in the side and it won\u2019t be taken lightly nor quickly.\u2019 No one is doubting that Ballance has a bright future but right now, when England\u2019s need is most acute, he looks rusty and short of the dynamism needed at this tournament. If England really are determined not to pick Hales \u2014 and every indication here is that deep down they do not think he is the answer \u2014 then perhaps Bopara comes back into the frame with James Taylor returning to three. That would give England an all-important extra bowling option if their preferred tactic of bombarding the opposition with short deliveries from Stuart Broad, Jimmy Anderson, Steven Finn and Chris Woakes does not work again. Ravi Bopara (right) and Eoin Morgan of England look on during an England nets session at the Adelaide Oval . Defeat by Bangladesh in Adelaide would pile the pressure on England coach Peter Moores . England have endured some rotten World Cups since they went close in 1992 and must beat Bangladesh . The big two of Broad and Anderson are just as big a worry as Ballance at three. Both have taken just two wickets in this World Cup and their return in tandem for the first time in one-day cricket in two years has not been the bowling panacea England were counting on after losing in Sri Lanka. \u2018It\u2019s a difficult one really,\u2019 said Morgan. \u2018They are exceptional bowlers but have not been putting the ball consistently in the right areas and haven\u2019t been able to take early wickets.\u2019 England need all their under-performing players to come through now. They should beat Bangladesh \u2014 who gained an unexpected point when their game against Australia in Brisbane was rained off \u2014 at the Adelaide Oval to keep their World Cup flame just about flickering. However, upsets do happen and Bangladesh have the ammunition to cause one. The simple truth is, at the moment, England do not look good enough to challenge the best teams here. And they don\u2019t need an analyst to tell them that.","highlights":"England face Bangladesh at World Cup on Monday at 3.30am GMT .\nPeter Moores knows his team can not afford a slip-up or rainy day .\nEngland must beat Bangladesh then Afghanistan to have a chance ."}

On trial: The video also shows the ex-New England Patriots tight end (pictured in court on Monday) returning to his $1.3million property with his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins. Their infant daughter was being babysat inside . However, when the video was played for jurors on Monday, the object was indiscernible. Hernandez and Jenkins's babysitter Jennifer Fortier, 28, then testified she had not seen the item in the room. The footage also shows Hernandez and Jenkins being greeted the suspect's two friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, who are also accused of killing Lloyd, who was dating Jenkins's sister. And it depicts\u00a0Hernandez climbing into the front passenger seat of a Nissan Altima rental car and leaving his home at 1:09 am, with Wallace driving and Ortiz sitting in the rear driver's-side seat.

{"article":"All work and no play is sure to make Prince Harry a dull boy when he solely focuses on his army duties during his trip to Australia next month. In stark contrast to when the fourth in line to the British throne made his way Down Under the previous two times,\u00a0his trip next month will revolve around training with Australian troops in army bases in Sydney, Darwin and Perth. When the party\u00a0boy Prince visited just two years ago, he relished in witnessing first-hand England's win over South Africa in the Rugby World Cup match  in Perth, and also joined in the festivities of the International Fleet Review's centenary celebrations on Sydney Harbour. While on his first Australian visit a decade earlier during his gap year when the prince was just a fresh-faced 18-year-old, he had the opportunity to cuddle up to the country's indigenous wildlife at Sydney's Taronga Zoo. But this time around, in what is believed to be a four-week assignment, the more mature and responsible 30-year-old, who is\u00a0known in the British Army as\u00a0Captain Harry Wales, will be participating in a 'challenging' training program specially prepared by the Australian Defence Force. This comes as Prince Harry has announced he will quit the\u00a0Armed Forces in June after his 10-year-military career. Scroll down for video .

On his first visit, ten years earlier the prince had the time to cuddle up to koalas at Taronga Zoo in Sydney . Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin said the attachment will provide Captain Wales with an opportunity to gain greater insight into the Australian Army's domestic operating environment and capabilities. 'We have prepared a challenging program that will see Captain Wales deploy on urban and field training exercises, domestic deployments, as well as participate in Indigenous engagement activities,' he said. 'While all our units are highly capable, we have selected those units that best utilise Captain Wales' skill sets and give him some experience of the diverse range of capability we have within the ADF. Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin said the British and Australian armies have a shared military history with secondments, exchanges, bilateral training and professional development all part of a routine practice between the two armed forces.

Prince Harry's assignment with the Australian Army is an extension of his regular British Army duties where he is currently working alongside case officers in the Personal Recovery Unit. 'It will build on his previous experience with coalition forces along with his advocacy work with wounded, injured and ill service personnel,' Air Chief Marshal Binksin said. 'It is also an opportunity for Australian Army personnel to learn from their British counterpart and I know our Diggers will welcome Captain Wales into the ranks when he arrives in Australia next month.' He will take a short break to attend the Gallipoli Commemorations in Turkey on April 24 and 25 with his father, Prince Charles. In May, he will then move onto New Zealand where he will undertake a short official tour during his first visit to the country at the invitation of the government. After he quits the Armed Forces in June, he will travel onto Africa where he will spend most of the summer undertaking 'field-based conservation work'.

The prince will spend the European summer working alongside conservation groups in Africa, after which he will undertake voluntary work with injured servicemen while 'actively considering other longer term employment opportunities'. In a statement Harry, 30, who has served in the military for ten years and seen two tours of duty in Afghanistan, admitted that it had been a 'tough decision' to leave the job he loved. Harry said today that he was 'really excited' about his future, adding: 'So while I am finishing off one part of my life, I am getting straight into a new chapter. I am really looking forward to it. ' But sources close to the prince said he had reached a 'natural crossroads' in his career and, after much soul-searching, had decided he had no desire to 'progress through the ranks'. 'The Prince has had a fulfilling military career and considers it a huge honour to have served his country in the Armed Forces, during which time he has undertaken two operational tours of duty in Afghanistan, qualified as an Apache Aircraft Commander and spearheaded the Invictus Games,' a Kensington Palace spokesman said: . Prince Harry will spend the summer doing voluntary work with injured servicemen, following his success in setting up the inaugural Invictus Games . A spokesman said: 'Prince Harry will spend a period of summer carrying out a programme of voluntary work alongside field-based conservation experts in Africa. He will focus his time learning how local communities in sub-Saharan Africa are working to protect and conserve their natural resources and wildlife.' In September, Harry will return to the UK to work with the Ministry of Defence in a voluntary capacity with its Recovery Capability Programme. This will build on his work on the Invictus Games, a Paralympic-style event for injured service personnel, which he helped bring to the UK last year. Kensington Palace said: 'In Autumn, Prince Harry will return to work in a voluntary capacity with the Ministry of Defence's Recovery Capability Programme, while actively considering other longer term employment opportunities.

{"article":"(CNN)Preliminary exit poll estimates released by Israel's three major broadcasters late Tuesday show an election too close to call. Millions of Israelis cast their votes to determine their country's next Prime Minister and the makeup of its parliament. Channel 2 Israel reports the Likud party, headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has a slight lead over the Zionist Union, led by Isaac Herzog -- 28 seats, over 27 seats. Channels 10 and 1 show the two tied with 27 seats each. The incumbent claimed victory ahead of a final count. \"Against all odds, we achieved this huge victory,\" Netanyahu told his cheering supporters. \"Now we should form a strong and stable government that will be able to take care of the security, safety and welfare of each and every citizen of Israel.\" The Zionist Union responded by saying in a statement that the Likud party \"keeps misleading.\" \"The rightist bloc has shrunk. Everything is possible until the real results are in, when we can know which parties passed the electoral threshold and which government we can form. All the spins and statements are premature,\" it read. Official results are not expected to be published until next week, and the process of building coalitions could take much longer. Gabriel Sassoon, foreign communications adviser for the Herzog campaign, said: \"The fat lady has far from sung in this case. We do not know. The parties are neck and neck and it's a matter of coalition negotiations and let me tell you, it's entirely possible to form a center-left coalition at this point. Israel is tired of nine long years of Netanyahu.\" Election ballots are for political parties rather than individual candidates. Israel has a proportional representation system, meaning a coalition government is likely to be formed within its 120-seat Knesset. How does Israel's parliament work? CNN's Elise Labott described the early results as a \"stunning turnaround\" for Netanyahu, who took a sharp turn toward the right during the final days of the hotly-contested campaign. \"It seems to have worked. He seems to have energized that right-wing base and now he is neck-and-neck with  Isaac Herzog, even inching a little bit ahead of him,\" she said. \"We'll have to see who's able to form the coalition with the other parties, but it does look as if Prime Minister Netanyahu has fought his way back and has a very good chance of forming this government.\" Before polls closed Tuesday, Netanyahu released a video on his Facebook page urging his supporters to vote, suggesting that leftists are bringing \"huge amounts\" of Israel's Arab citizens to the polls to vote against his Likud party. \"The right regime is in danger, the Arab voters are coming in huge amounts to the polls,\" Netanyahu said. \"The leftists are bringing them (Arabs) in huge amounts to polls using buses. ... We have an urgent wake-up call.\" Arabs make up about 20% of Israel's population. According to the early exit poll estimates, an Arab coalition ranked as the third largest party. Arab citizens of Israel face defining moment in election . Moshe Kahlon, a former Likud minister who now heads the Kulanu party, said Netanyahu's statement \"clearly shows he is feeling the pressure.\" \"These remarks were inappropriate and regrettable,\" Kahlon said. Polls closed at 10 p.m. local time (4 p.m. ET). Following the release of exit poll estimates, President Reuven Rivlin said that citizens need a ruling government as soon as possible. \"The President will work with all the election bodies to start the consultations process ASAP. We hope to start as soon as Sunday,\" his office said in a statement. Herzog comes from Israeli political royalty. His grandfather, Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog, was the first chief rabbi of the state of Israel. His father, Chaim Herzog, was an Army general, an ambassador to the United Nations and the President of Israel. Before entering politics, Herzog served with a military intelligence unit of the Israeli Defense Forces, rising to the rank of major, and worked as a lawyer and served as the director of the Israel Anti-Drug Authority. He began his political career in 2003, when he first won a seat in the Knesset with the Labor Party. He held a variety of ministerial positions, including minister of housing and construction, minister of tourism and minister of welfare and social services before becoming leader of the Labor Party in 2013. In those elections, he also became the leader of the opposition, as Netanyahu won another term as Prime Minister. Herzog has pegged his bid for the premiership on social reform, vowing to \"change the nature of the division of wealth.\" He has also promised to restart stalled peace talks with the Palestinian Authority. Netanyahu served for six years in the Israeli Army in an elite commando unit until he was wounded in a rescue operation during an airplane hijacking in 1972. In 1976, Netanyahu's brother was killed in a raid to try to free hostages in Uganda from an Air France jet hijacked by pro-Palestinian terrorists. Netanyahu set up an anti-terror institute in his name. His outspokenness on the threat of terrorism attracted attention, and he was given high-profile diplomatic assignments. In 1988, he was elected to the Knesset. In 1996, he became Israel's youngest Prime Minister. He was defeated three years later after signing an interim peace agreement with then-Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. In 2009, he again became Prime Minister. CNN's Labott says Netanyahu's emphasis on security -- particularly speaking out loudly on Iran -- and his counteroffensives against Hamas in Gaza have boosted his popularity in Israel. But Labott says peace with the Palestinians remains elusive, and Netanyahu is finding himself increasingly alienated from Western partners. As negotiations with Iran near a crucial state, Netanyahu has sided against the White House, telling the U.S. Congress this month that a proposed agreement was \"a bad deal\" and would not be supported by Israel, which would stand alone if necessary to defend its people. Five key challenges for next Prime Minister . CNN's Susannah Cullinane, Kevin Flower and Oren Lieberman contributed to this report.","highlights":"One major TV channel gives Benjamin Netanyahu a slight, one-seat edge .\nTwo other channels show him tied at 27 seats with Isaac Herzog .\nBallots are for political parties rather than individual prime ministerial candidates ."}
{"article":"Ferguson, Missouri (CNN)Loistine Hoskin cared for her old car as a sentimental possession, missing a tire while parked beside her home, until one day the city ticketed her for having a \"derelict vehicle in driveway.\" A tow truck took it away in 2009. So began an odyssey with Ferguson police, municipal court and city hall that left her with $1,200 in fines that to this day she still doesn't fully understand. She paid the sum because endless court hearings about the car wore her down. \"I don't have a lawyer. I'm not a lawyer. It's me going up against the city of Ferguson when the attorneys won't help,\" Hoskin said this week. She never saw again her 1996 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight with 168,000 miles. Its location is a mystery. She accepts the loss because at least she's not  in jail, where city authorities threatened to put her at one point, she said. While Hoskin's surrender of both car and $1,200 to the city may seem a matter of personal choice, the U.S. Justice Department revealed this week a \"pattern and practice\" of racial discrimination within Ferguson that may lend credibility to Hoskin's account of a government run amok. Just about every branch of Ferguson government -- police, municipal court, city hall -- participated in \"unlawful\" targeting of African-American residents such as Hoskin for tickets and fines, the Justice Department concluded this week. The millions of dollars in fines and fees paid by black residents served an ultimate goal of satisfying \"revenue rather than public safety needs,\" the Justice Department found. To the outside world, the federal findings were staggering, but to Hoskin and other longtime residents, the conclusion was nothing new. They've felt it all along, they say. It's only now that federal authorities have documented the institutionalized racism, as part of a civil rights investigation after a white police officer's fatal shooting of an unarmed black teen, Michael Brown, 19, last summer. The officer, Darren Wilson, was cleared of federal civil rights violations this week and was earlier cleared of criminal wrongdoing. The Justice Department is expected to pursue a court-supervised consent decree that requires the city of Ferguson to make changes to its police and courts. \"It's definitely a vicious cycle,\" said Hoskin, 64, a retired airline reservation agent. \"Unfortunately for most people who are in this cycle, they continue to be in a downward spiral because they can't get jobs, they can't do anything, they can't pay the fines.\" Hoskin's household has experienced its share of ugly encounters with Ferguson police, the family said. Hoskin's daughter was ticketed by police in what she described as racial profiling, she said. In 2007, Kimberly Hoskin got a $124 ticket for driving her sister's car, which wasn't insured in Missouri, and then had to pay an additional $100 fine when she missed a court appearance because of an emergency appendectomy. The court, she said, rejected her medical excuse and issued a warrant for her arrest. She paid a total of $224 in fines because she was in the middle of a job search and didn't want an outstanding warrant to prevent her from getting a good job. \"Why is it that all the people in court are black?\" Kimberly Hoskin said of defendants in municipal court. \"I've had so many police officers make a U-turn, follow me, run my plates, find out everything is OK, then turn around and go back in the direction they were going. \"There's nothing we can do. In Ferguson, the police do what they want to do. Ferguson does what it wants,\" said Kimberly Hoskin, 35, who now works the overnight shift on a General Motors manufacturing line. City officials and police declined to respond to CNN's requests this week for comment about the Hoskin family's assertions. Last September, the City Council repealed administrative fees imposed by police when overseeing the release of a towed vehicle, the mayor said. The city also no longer has a specific offense for failing to appear in court, which eliminates certain additional fees and court costs, the mayor said. The Justice Department's report details how Ferguson operated a vertically integrated system -- from street cop to court clerk to judge to city administration to city council -- to raise revenue for the city budget through increased ticketing and fining. Ferguson's budget increases were so sizable that city officials exhorted police and court staff to levy more and more fines and tickets against violators, who turned out to be largely African-American, the Justice Department said. The demands for revenue were so intense that the police department had \"little concern with how officers do this,\" even disciplining officers who failed to issue an average of 28 tickets a month, the Justice Department report said. Officers competed \"to see who could issue the largest number of citations during a single stop,\" the Justice Department said. One apparent winner was an officer who issued 14 tickets at a single encounter, according to the federal investigation report. Many police stops of civilians \"have little relation to public safety and a questionable basis in law,\" the report said. Ferguson police chief mum on federal report . Indeed, Ferguson enjoyed so much success in issuing tickets and fines that Ferguson, population 21,000, was ranked in the top eight of the 80 municipal courts in St. Louis County by having more than $1 million in revenue in 2010, the report said. When Ferguson court revenues exceeded $2 million in 2012, the city manager responded to the police chief in an internal email: \"Awesome! Thanks!\" according to the federal report. Even municipal judges were pressured to boost revenue. \"The city has made clear to the police chief and the municipal judge that revenue generation must also be a priority in court operations,\" the federal investigation found. The city finance director said in a 2011 report that the municipal judge had been successful since 2003 in increasing court collections, and that internal 2011 city report noted a judge's statement that \"none of these changes could have taken place without the cooperation of the court clerk, the chief of police, and the prosecutor's office,\" the Justice Department investigation found. Cash filled the city treasury. By 2013, revenue from enforcing municipal codes reached $2.46 million, the federal report said. By 2015, the city anticipated that fines and fees would account for 23% of the budget, or $3.09 million of $13.26 million in general fund expenses, the Justice Department found. Just five years earlier, court fines and fees made up only 12% of the budget, or $1.38 million of $11.07 million in general fund revenues, the Justice Department found. The fines were among the highest of surrounding municipalities. For example, area parking fines ranged from $5 to $100, but Ferguson's parking fine was $102. A fine for \"weeds\/tall grass\" was $5 in one nearby city, but Ferguson's fine ranged from $77 to $102, the Justice Department found. The federal government made a forceful conclusion: . \"City, police and court officials for years have worked in concert to maximize revenue at every stage of the enforcement process, beginning with how fines and fine enforcement processes are established,\" the federal report said. After the Justice Department's announcement this week, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles told reporters that he, Police Chief Tom Jackson and City Attorney Stephanie Karr met with federal officials about their findings and initiated several initiatives, including reforms to the municipal court. Knowles said municipal judges have created a docket for alleged offenders having trouble paying fines. Also, a defendant may ask a judge or prosecutor about different payment plans or alternative sentencing, the mayor said. Defendants have been required to pay an entire fine at once, regardless of ability to pay, the federal report said. The city also passed an ordinance last September to cap municipal court revenues at 15% of the city's overall budget, the mayor said. That figure is half Missouri's legal limit, he added. All the reforms are intended to \"move this city, its residents and our entire community forward,\" the mayor said. Back at her home, Loistine Hoskin recalled the height of absurdity in her fight against the city, which occurred shortly after her husband, Calvin, died in 2008 of complications from paralysis he suffered in a car accident three years earlier. She had been his caregiver. She appeared in court to appeal the citation, but an officer arrested her and put her in the back of the squad car. Her offense? Failing to appear in court, she said. She spent four hours in jail. She insists she made every court date. For now, she lives in fear of the police, even at home. \"We just got to a point where we said we're just not going to have anyone over -- because they were fearful when they left they would get some ticket, and they didn't even live here,\" Hoskin said. CNN's Ed Lavandera and Tristan Smith contributed from Ferguson. Michael Martinez reported and wrote this story from Los Angeles.","highlights":"Loistine Hoskin gave up fighting the city, paying $1,200 in fines over a broken-down car .\nHer daughter recounts how she was racially profiled for a $124 ticket .\nFerguson mayor announces reforms so his troubled town can move forward ."}
{"article":"The Chinese football authority has announced plans to recruit a first batch of 120 foreign coaches by the end of 2015 to help teach pupils in primary and secondary schools, according to\u00a0People's Daily Online. The news comes as a part of the 'Campus Football Promotion Campaign', which is widely understood as the country's effort to turn the nation into a football powerhouse by raising a generation of all-conquering young footballers. China's current president Xi Jinping is a massive fan of the game and is keen to see his country qualifying for another World Cup -- and ultimately winning it. Apart from importing coaching talent from overseas, the authority also confirmed that it is to make football a mandatory lesson in 6,000 selected schools as well as launching football leagues on campus from September this year. Pupils from a primary school in Luoyang (pictured) doing 'football exercise' between classes last week . The country's education authority has\u00a0made football a compulsory part of the national curriculum . 6,000 primary and secondary schools in China have been chosen to specialise in football. In these schools, pupil will have one football lesson every week . The authority is also hoping to recruit and train 30,000-50,000 football teachers in 2015 across China . The series of new football-oriented education reforms were announced by Wang Dengfeng, Deputy President of Chinese Football Association, during an interview. 'The desired foreign coaches need to come from countries that are traditionally good with the sport, especially those who are particularly experienced with training youngsters,' said Wang, who is also in charge of the Culture, Hygiene and Arts section in the Ministry of Education in China. The first batch of 120 foreign coaches will be sent to 40 cities around the country. Wang stressed that they are not recruited to train professional football teams, but to teach ordinary schoolchildren in primary and secondary schools. Every pupil in China will be required to learn basic football skills such as 'balancing on a ball' and doing 'keepy-uppy' with their insteps . The country's Ministry of Education plans to build an army of local football teachers too. The expectation is to recruit and train 30,000 of 50,000 of them in 2015 throughout China. Outstanding retired athletes from the army will also be arranged to work as PE teachers, according to Wang. Professional football leagues will also be launched this year in all tiers of academic institutions, from primary schools to universities. Wang expects the leagues will create at least 290 champion teams from primary schools alone. China is aiming to complete its first set of football textbooks by the end of March. Thirty football 'experts' are involved in the drafting the books . Young players, teachers and coaches will be able to access online football tutorials linked to the books . 'Campus football competitions will be mainly organised by schools,' he said, 'and the aim is to cultivate public interest and to create a football culture.' The Chinese authority has already made football a compulsory part of the national curriculum for schoolchildren. In normal schools, the sport will be a mandatory course for at least one semester during pupils' academic years; whereas in the country's newly established 6,000 football-specialisedd schools, schoolchildren will receive one football lesson every week.

{"article":"(CNN)On and off for over 40 years, I have had the privilege of roaming around the West Wing of the White House, usually as a member of the staff, sometimes as a journalist or visitor. For all that time, almost everything has been pretty much the same -- from the configuration of furniture in the oval to the four Norman Rockwell sketches hanging in the hallways. But this past weekend, making a visit, there was something that was brand new and entirely welcome:  There among the stream of visitors touring the West Wing were many families of every color, especially African-Americans.  You may not think that is so different, but it is. For as long as I have known, the West Wing has essentially been the preserve of whites, especially white men. My wife Anne and I, along with 10-year-old grandkids Gabriel Barnett and Maya Gergen, were there for a superb, two-hour tour by a young man, Clay Dumas,  once a college intern working with me and now an aide to the President.  (He also happens to be white.) Like most staff members over the years, Clay spoke with near reverence about his President as he pointed out many photos of Obama on the walls. What seemed so natural to him was what was what also struck me as new: Photo after photo showed people of color working and meeting their President alongside and of equal standing with whites. Of course, it didn't take a visit to the white house to know that Barack Obama has promoted diversity.  Still, before seeing up close, I had not appreciated how deeply his approach has permeated day-to-day life.  This White House appears to be a model of racial, ethnic and gender integration. To be sure, earlier presidents had already taken steps down this path.  President Bill Clinton was the first to name a cabinet in which women and people of color outnumbered white males.   President George W. Bush surprised some when he continued that tradition.  But in the West Wing itself, white men continued to dominate the inner circles. President Obama's efforts to allocate power in new ways have  sometimes raised hackles.  That three of the most influential people around him are African-American women isn't the issue, insist critics sotto voce; rather it is whether two of them, Valerie Jarrett and Susan Rice, are the right people for their jobs. Both have come under periodic barrages.  But to be fair, it isn't as if there hasn't been a string of white males in the past who have been even less suited for powerful White House jobs. As I left the White House this past Saturday, I knew that I would continue to grind my teeth over many of President Obama's policies along with his leadership style. But as a white southerner inspired by the civil rights movement, I must say that I was also impressed and grateful that he has made the West Wing such a welcome home for Americans of every color and background.  It's about time. I will write my young friend Clay and tell him that one day, accompanied by his grandchildren, he will return to the West Wing and be proud that he served under the first president to turn diversity into a living reality at the White House. That is one of the positive legacies of this President that deserves greater recognition.","highlights":"David Gergen says Barack Obama doesn't get enough credit for transforming the White House .\nGergen: The President has turned diversity into a living reality in the West Wing ."}

{"article":"Robbie Henshaw believes Ireland's fledgling centre partnership faces its toughest RBS Six Nations test yet in Wales on Saturday against Jamie Roberts and Jonathan Davies. Connacht battering ram Henshaw has rubbished the suggestions that Warren Gatland's Wales are past their peak that surfaced after the 21-16 home defeat to England. Ireland's 21-year-old midfield sensation will pair up with Jared Payne in the centres for just the fifth time in Test action at the Millennium Stadium. Ireland's newest sensation Robbie Henshaw (left) believes Wales will give him the toughest test of his career . Roberts and Davies will combine from the start for the 38th time on Saturday, at the heart of an unchanged line-up following victory over France in Paris. 'I think it could definitely be the toughest test for me and Jared,' said Henshaw of the challenge against Roberts and Davies. 'Wales are very direct but also they run decoy lines with Roberts coming up, only to throw it out the back and go wide. The centre scored a crucial try during their victory of Six Nations rivals England at the Aviva Stadium . 'It's going to test us big-time, so we've got to be prepared and stay connected in defence, and just keep our communication up all day.' Racing Metro centre Roberts will win his 68th Test cap for Wales this weekend while Clermont's Davies will make it 47 in Cardiff's pivotal Six Nations clash. Ireland can remain on course for a second Grand Slam in seven years with victory on Saturday, with a trip to Scotland still ahead. Jared Payne (left) celebrates with the scorer as Ireland look in pole position to win the Six Nations . Ruthless boss Joe Schmidt this week omitted veteran centre Gordon D'Arcy from his 36-man training squad for the remaining two Six Nations contests. D'Arcy and Brian O'Driscoll set a world record 55-Test centre partnership in their wide-ranging careers. Henshaw has long been touted as the now-retired O'Driscoll's natural successor at outside centre, but has instead found himself replacing D'Arcy at 12. The Athlone native is gearing up for just his ninth cap in Cardiff, with New Zealand-born Payne in line for his fifth Test bow. The new Irish sensation is being touted as the player to replace legend Brian O'Driscoll (centre) So from boasting the world's most experienced centre pairing en route to last year's Six Nations title, Ireland will concede 101 caps to their midfield rivals against Wales this weekend. Henshaw has vowed he and Payne 'won't hold back' however, buoyed by his first Test try that clinched Ireland's 19-9 victory over England on March 1. 'This Wales team is absolutely not past its peak,' said Henshaw. 'The fact that they are at home and that they play their best rugby at the Millennium, they're going to cause a massive threat for us. 'So we're going to have to be squeaky clean on the day in terms of our discipline and we're going to have to take all the chances we get. Henshaw knows he's in for a tough afternoon when he comes up against the experienced Jamie Roberts . Wales centre Jonathan Davies (centre) has formed an impressive partnership with Roberts over the years . 'It might be more open than the England game, but we want to stick to our game plan and follow through on what the coaches want from us. 'It's not going to be more than a two-score game though. 'They are not predictable either: they have a lot of different options available to them with Dan Biggar at 10. 'He gives them a good attacking threat and good aerial skills in the team. 'We're just going to have to be prepared for anything. 'I think the Welsh centre partnership is up there with one of the best in the world.

'I'm constantly learning, growing into it more and more, getting a bit more confident with every game, especially with Jared outside and Johnny (Sexton) inside.

{"article":"(CNN)Gov. Mike Pence unleashed a firestorm on Indiana last week when he signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Critics of the law contend it could be used by individuals and businesses to discriminate -- particularly against the LGBT community of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals -- on the basis of religion. The ramifications for the Hoosier State are just starting to be felt in the form of boycotts, petitions and travel bans. As the controversy mushrooms, here's what got us to where we are. And where things are headed. Last week, Pence put his signature on the RFRA -- a law that allows Indiana businesses to cite their religious freedom as a legal defense. The law states that the government can't \"substantially burden a person's exercise of religion\" and that individuals who feel like their religious beliefs have been or could be \"substantially burdened\" can lean on this law to fend off lawsuits. In an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, Pence says the RFRA \"ensures that Indiana law will respect religious freedom and apply the highest level of scrutiny to any state or local governmental action that infringes on people's religious liberty.\" Pence notes that there is no reference to sexual orientation in the law. Civil liberties and gay rights groups hold to their stance that the law could be used by businesses to deny service to people based on their sexual orientation and justify that discrimination based on their religious belief. \"Silence is consent!\" tweets Laurel Davilia, a commentator on Brass Knuckles Progressives Radio. From sports teams to musicians to other cities and states, they fell like dominoes. The NCAA, which is headquartered in Indianapolis and set to host its men's basketball Final Four in the city this week, said the law could lead it to move events elsewhere in future years. The NBA, WNBA and NFL issued critical statements too. Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay says fans of all stripes are welcome. \"The Colts have always embraced inclusiveness, tolerance, and a diverse fan base,\" Irsay tweets.  \"We welcome ALL fans to Colts Nation.   ONE FAMILY!\" A petition posted on change.org hopes to get the Big Ten Conference to move its football championship out of Indianapolis. \"I think that Indiana needs to be told that it must respect all persons regardless of sex, age, religion, gender identity, or sexual orientation,\" Sean Burke of Madison, Wisconsin, says in the petition.  \"As a football fan, I think we can send a message by calling on the NCAA and Big Ten Conference to take a stand.\" Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis is scheduled to host the league's championship game through the 2021 season. At last check, the petition had more than 11,000 supporters. The mayors of San Francisco and Seattle have barred spending on travel to Indiana.  The governors of Connecticut and Washington state did the same thing. And you can add Wilco to the boycott bandwagon. The group is canceling its May 7 show in Indianapolis, it says on Facebook. \"The 'Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act' feels like thinly disguised legal discrimination to us,\" Wilco says.  \"Hope to get back to the Hoosier State someday soon, when this odious measure is repealed.\" Cher is among the artists speaking out.  Her son Chaz Bono is a transgender man. \"#GOVPENCE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF RIGHT WING RACISM, ASAULT ON WOMANS RIGHTS & HATRED OF LGBT AMERICANS,\" she tweets. Indiana's top two state lawmakers pledged Monday to amend the state's controversial \"religious freedom\" law to clarify that it cannot be used to discriminate against gay people. \"This law does not discriminate, and it will not be allowed to do so,\" David Long, the Indiana Senate president pro tem, said during a news conference with state House Speaker Brian Bosma. Pence had said earlier that he was working with lawmakers to clarify the law. Critics still weren't on board with the anti-discrimination claims.  Opponents of RFRA marched around the state capitol. Someone even created a satire ad:  \"Indiana. It's a great place to be a bigot.\". The rhetoric has reached such a fever pitch that a front page editorial in Tuesday's edition of the Indianapolis Star blares the headline:  \"Fix.  This.  Now.\" The editorial suggests the RFRA and protections for gays and lesbians can co-exist. The state is at a crossroads it says. \"(N)o matter its original intent (the law) already has done enormous harm to our state and potentially our economic future,\" according to the editorial.  \"Only bold action -- action that sends an unmistakable message to the world that our state will not tolerate discrimination against any of its citizens -- will be enough to reverse the damage.\" The editorial closes with: . \"Governor, Indiana is in a state of crisis. It is worse than you seem to understand. \"You must act with courage and wisdom. You must lead us forward now. You must ensure that all Hoosiers have strong protections against discrimination. \"The laws can co-exist. And so can we.\" Some of the GOP's top figures are backing Pence despite the controversy.  Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio have voiced their support.  Both are considered likely Republican candidates for the White House. Sen. Ted Cruz, who announced his candidacy last week, is also on board. \"I'm proud to stand with Gov. @mike_pence for religious liberty, and I urge Americans to do the same,\" Cruz tweets. Indiana is the 20th state to adopt a \"religious freedom restoration\" law, most of which are modeled after the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which President Bill Clinton signed into law in 1993. But that law passed with the backing of a broad-based coalition and wasn't set against the backdrop of gay rights or the wave of marriage equality laws that have swept the country in recent years. Adam Talbot, a spokesman with the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group, stresses that those 20 laws are \"dramatically different in their scope and effect.\" \"Calling them similar in this way risks being misleading. Indiana is the broadest and most dangerous law of its kind in the country,\" Talbot says. Arkansas' legislature passed an Indiana-style law on Friday, which now heads to the state's governor for approval. Despite the controversy, the Indiana governor says concerns that his state's new \"religious freedom\" law will allow businesses to turn away LGBT customers is the result of a \"tremendous amount of misinformation and misunderstanding.\" Still, he was hard pressed to explain why that wasn't the case. Given a chance on Sunday to add some clarity, Pence refused to answer at least six yes-or-no questions from ABC's George Stephanopoulos about whether the measure legalizes discrimination against gays and lesbians. Jeremy Diamond and Eric Bradner contributed to this report.","highlights":"Indiana is under fire for the Religious Freedom Restoration Act .\nCritics say it discriminates against the LGBT community ."}
{"article":"(CNN)From the moment we are born, the first question our parents are asked is, \"Is it a boy or a girl?\" The answer to that seemingly simple question quickly establishes the child's path and trajectory for years to come; however, the question is not simple. The question is tragically flawed and here's a newsflash for everyone who has ever asked new parents that question: You're asking the wrong people. I realize that parents are simply sharing a bit of biological information based on their baby's physical \"parts,\" but only that beautiful baby can accurately and authentically tell you what gender he or she is. You may want to give it a little time before you paint that nursery bright pink or pick out junior's first baseball glove -- it's just not that simple. I may only be 15 years old and will be the first to admit that I know very little about this great big world, but I know way too much about gender and being mislabeled. Why transgender teen Jazz Jennings is everywhere . You see, the doctor told my parents, \"It's a girl,\" but he couldn't have been more wrong. Aside from my biology, I knew I was a boy from the age of 2. I was 100% sure of who I was and biology was an insignificant part of the conversation. Keep in mind that this was a time before I had even realized that being a boy trapped in a girl's body was anything beyond normal, and this was long before I could possibly articulate what was happening. However, there was no need to articulate anything. I was a little boy expressing myself based on what was in my heart and mind -- not yet distorted by biology, other people's confusion, or fear. It was when I was older that other people let me know something was \"off.\" No matter how many times I was told differently, I was a boy and the people that mattered knew it too, for the most part. I want to address the moment where people, gender, and respectful communication part ways. That is the moment when the word \"sexuality\" creeps into the conversation. That is when people get scared, cite religion, start whispering, and disconnect. It's a sad moment, but I get it. People have always mocked what they don't understand, and this is a tough one for most to grasp. That said, it has to change and I believe it is changing. The transgender life: What to know, say and understand . I cannot stress to the world enough, gender and sexuality are two completely different things, and the moment people incorrectly connect them is the moment when most people start looking for an exit or a fight. Save your fear people. This is not something to be afraid of; it's an opportunity for us to evolve. Nothing is completely black or white, hot or cold, here or there, or male and female; there are varying degrees of everything and the quicker we respect that, the faster we all grow and allow people to be who they are. It all starts by taking sexuality out of the initial conversation. I first heard the term \"gay\" in the second grade, long after I had my first \"girlfriend\" and had proudly written \"a penis\" at the top of my Christmas list. Not until after I learned that there was such a thing as sexuality and homosexuality did I become afraid of who I was. It wasn't until I learned that there were people out there that considered homosexuality \"abnormal\" or that people needed to put labels on our feelings toward others that I became terrified that I was \"different.\" I knew I liked girls and I was technically a girl, biologically, but I was a boy and my feelings about girls were normal boy feelings. I was not gay -- but try to explain that to someone without his or her eyes glazing over. Thankfully, I grew up in a household that taught me that I could love anybody I wanted to and it was fine because it is fine. Anyone can love anyone and there is nothing wrong with that. Fortunately, people have developed more of an understanding of that over time, but there are always going to be people that think differently and we all have to accept that. Do they matter? Of course they do because we all matter, equally; however, ignorant people are here to help us learn how to better communicate; everyone is reachable with the right circumstances and I look forward to the battles as much as the victories. As long as you're happy, you're indestructible. That said, I knew being gay wasn't a bad thing, but I also knew it didn't describe me. I was a straight boy who liked girls and there is nothing wrong with that, either. I was afraid of being thought of differently. The most crippling fear came from people not understanding that I was a boy trapped in a girl's body and simply labeling me something I'm not. That's what I was truly afraid of. Experience how one family reacted when their daughter said she's a boy. CNN Films presents \"Raising Ryland,\" a short film available exclusively on CNN Digital on Wednesday, March 18. Discovering that I was transgender was a miraculous moment. I finally found the key that unlocked the cage I'd been trapped in for 14 years and that's why I call this journey, \"My Transcension.\" With the support of my parents, I am sharing my story. Breaking free and owning your sexuality is something you find within yourself and is spectacular, but it is just the tiniest part of the greater transgender conversation. I am going beyond that and my journey is one that is constantly moving forward and upward. I'm taking the body I was born into and transforming it into the body I know I'm supposed to be in -- thanks to my family, friends, Dr. Jo Olson, the support groups, the science, and lastly, myself. See, that's the irony, I was the first person and truly the only person capable of answering the \"is it a boy or girl\" question -- not the doctor, my parents, or anyone who thinks they know better. That is the lesson, let each of us dictate our own path and respect everyone's choice. I realize that it's easier said than done but if you read this and find yourself open to a new conversation about gender, I consider that a win for us all. Truthfully, I'm most proud of myself for having the courage to find my own way and owning it, to proudly begin my transcencion from someone I wasn't -- into the man I always knew I'd become. Whether I'm a boy or a girl, white or black, rich or poor, gay or straight, it's completely irrelevant. What truly matters is the fact that I'm Avery Wallace and I've always known exactly who I was. I'm here to share my journey and hopefully, help someone else recognize theirs.","highlights":"Avery Wallace says he knew he was a boy from age 2 .\n\"I knew being gay wasn't a bad thing, but I also knew it didn't describe me,\" Avery says .\nPeople mock what they don't understand, he says ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Chelsea claimed the first silverware of the English domestic season and Jose Mourinho's first trophy of his second spell in charge with a 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley Sunday. Deflected efforts either side of halftime from Chelsea captain John Terry and leading scorer Diego Costa dashed Tottenham's hopes in the all-London League Cup final. Chelsea had suffered a chastening Christmas defeat to the same opposition in the English Premier League, with Harry Kane starring, but the promising young English striker was kept largely quiet in the showpiece occasion. The first half saw Tottenham edge the possession and carry more of the attacking threat, with Dane Christian Eriksen's free kick rattling the Chelsea crossbar. But chances for either side from open play  were in short supply and it was from a free kick that Chelsea went ahead just before the break. Willian's delivery from the right brushed Danny Rose's head and fell invitingly to Terry whose shot went into the net after taking a deflection off Eric Dier. Tottenham might have felt hard done by and the sense of injustice would have deepened on 56 minutes as Cesc Fabregas found Costa down the left and his firm strike took another wicked deflection, this time off Walker, who was credited with the own goal, to leave goalkeeper Hugo Lloris with no chance. It seemed to take the sting out of the Tottenham challenge and although Kane had a late half chance, it was Terry who typically snuffed out the threat with a timely tackle. It was the fifth time Chelsea had lifted the English League Cup and third under Mourinho. The Portuguese claimed it in his first season with the west London club in 2005 and after returning to the Stamford Bridge hot seat last season has broken his mini-trophy drought. Mourinho, whose side is also well-placed to go through to the quarterfinals of the Champions League, was clearly reveling in his latest success, his 21st career trophy as a manager. \"'It is important to feel like a kid at 52 years old,\" he said. Man of the match Terry is hoping it will pave the way for further triumphs. \"It's the first trophy this season and it's massive. It meant an awful lot to us when we won it in Jose's first year in 2005 as well,\" he said. \"That could be the start of something very good. We have to kick on and we have got the league to focus on, but it's a great day and a great win.\" Man City blow . Chelsea was also boosted by an earlier result in the EPL as its nearest title rival Manchester City was beaten 2-1 at Liverpool. City had hoped to cut the gap at the top on Chelsea to just two points with a win at Anfield, but instead suffered a chastening reverse. Jordan Henderson put Liverpool ahead with a thumping shot after just 11 minutes only for Edin Dzeko to draw City, defending the EPL title, level midway through the first half. Liverpool, looking to boost its own chances of Champions League football next season, dominated after the break and deservedly took three points after Philippe Coutinho scored a superb late winner with a curling shot which flew past Joe Hart. Arsenal stayed third by beating Everton 2-0 with Olivier Giroud and Tomas Rosicky scoring late in each half to give the Gunners a boost after a Champions League defeat to Monaco in midweek.","highlights":"Chelsea wins English League Cup at Wembley .\nJose Mourinho's team beats Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 at Wembley .\nJohn Terry and Kyle Walker own goal for Chelsea .\nMan City loses 2-1 at Liverpool to miss chance to close on Chelsea at top of EPL ."}

{"article":"Hong Kong (CNN)\"Go back home!\" \"Locusts! You're not welcome here!\" These were just some of the insults hurled at Chinese shoppers Sunday as hundreds of Hong Kongers surged through through the old neighborhood of Yuen Long, an area close to the city's border with China. It was the latest in a series of angry protests that have seen brawls erupt in humdrum shopping malls, with demonstrators singling out the \"parallel traders\" who crowd into Hong Kong to purchase tax-free products and then resell them for a profit back in China. \"I've grown up here, and ever since a lot of the Chinese started coming into Hong Kong, things have changed,\" said Suen, a law student who only gave her surname. Clad in a mask to protect against police wielding pepper spray, she took part in the protest with her mother. Local residents say the traders are not only disturbing the peace, but are driving up the price of food, rent, and gutting local neighborhoods of their character - the city has become a blur of jewelers, pharmacies and other businesses that cater primarily to Chinese shoppers. \"Previously there were a lot of indigenous places like restaurants, but all of them have closed,\" said Suen, standing across from a store selling baby milk powder - the top item on many Chinese tourists' shopping lists. \"It's very difficult to be very welcoming.\" Tensions have long been simmering between Hong Kong and the motherland, and parallel trading is just one of the thorny issues brought about by the influx of mainland Chinese to the city. A series of food scandals -- most notably in 2008 when melamine-tainted milk powder caused infant deaths across China -- led to shortages of baby milk formula in Hong Kong as Chinese flocked to buy up the city's supplies. The ensuing uproar led the government to introduce a law limiting the purchase to two tins per traveler leaving the city. Last year, 31 million Chinese visitors traveled to Hong Kong, accounting for 78% of all tourists, according to the government. But the numbers hide that the visitors aren't all sightseeing tourists in the traditional sense. There are the day-trippers, wheeling suitcases and carting boxes of goods and supplies across the border, but there is also an increasing number of wealthy mainland Chinese who are buying up luxury properties, and visit the city on a regular basis. According to the Global Property Guide, developers say as much as 40% of new home buyers are from China. Residents blame them for causing a hike in real estate prices in what reports say is already the most expensive property market in the world. Both the Chinese and Hong Kong government have encouraged mainland tourists to visit the city and boost the local economy. Relaxed restrictions have made it easy for Chinese residents to get a hold of individual multiple-entry permits -- some mainlanders enter hundreds of times a year on a single pass. This has infuriated protestors, particularly the younger generation, who want the government to scrap the permits. In a speech last Tuesday,  the city's pro-Beijing leader C.Y. Leung announced that his government would examine restricting mainland visitors, acknowledging the pressure the crowds have had on the everyday lives of Hong Kong residents. But the permit controversy is just one symptom of a deeper conflict. When it comes down to it, it's simple: Many Hong Kongers just don't feel very Chinese. According to a recent survey by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the number of Hong Kong residents identifying primarily as \"Chinese\" has dipped to an all-time low since the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997. The majority of respondents said they were \"Hong Kongers first, and also Chinese.\" Earlier in 2012, plans to add Chinese civic education into the Hong Kong public school curriculum caused an uproar, resulting in a city-wide protest with locals claiming it would \"brainwash\" school children with pro-mainland propaganda. Hong Kong, ruled under China's principle of \"One country, two systems,\" means the city is a officially part of China, but is allowed rights and freedoms unseen in other Chinese cities. But there's one key privilege Beijing has refused to grant to Hong Kong: Free and open elections for their own leader. Frustrated Hong Kongers have tried everything to demand greater voting rights, from hunger strikes to massive street occupations, with no luck. That's why people in Hong Kong feel an increasing sense of resentment and helplessness when it comes to solving the complex, growing rift between their city and mainland China. A small but growing minority of disgruntled activists go as far as to say Hong Kong should not belong to China at all. \"We Hong Kong people have our own culture, we have our own currency, we have all the requirements to build a country.\" said Julian Li, a member of a radical pro-Hong Kong group. \"For decades we have been fighting against civic rights, democracy. However, no matter how much we have been working, it's like we're begging for something that will never happen.\" Many mainland Chinese are bewildered by the anger directed at them. \"It's normal for people to spend money and shop here, why are they protesting?\" said a Chinese tourist waiting at a bus stop to get away from the angry crowds. She said her suitcase was loaded with make-up and clothing that is much cheaper to buy in Hong Kong than across the border in her hometown of Zhuhai. \"There's definitely an element of discrimination against mainlanders here. I'm not saying everyone is like that in Hong Kong, but there are certain people who are very prejudiced,\" she added. Another Chinese resident who makes weekly visits to relatives in the city was sitting on a curb away from the ruckus. She said her friends have considered boycotting Hong Kong altogether. \"My friends on WeChat say, don't come to Hong Kong, let's burn our travel permits,\" she said as she thumbed through the receipts of her latest purchases. \"We should all just be more considerate and tolerant of each other, we're just here to shop. Let's just be happy,\" she said.","highlights":"Hong Kong protests highlight rift between the city and mainland China .\nResidents say massive influx of Chinese has disturbed peace, and driven up prices .\nBut the protests points at a deeper  issue about Hong Kong identity ."}
{"article":"(CNN)India's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has told all news channels not to air a controversial documentary about rape in India -- warning that the excerpts \"appear to encourage and incite violence against women.\" The BBC Storyville documentary was originally scheduled to air Sunday, but due to the \"intense level of interest\" in the program, the BBC aired it Wednesday in the UK on BBC Four \"to enable viewers to see this incredibly powerful documentary at the earliest opportunity,\" the broadcaster said in a statement. The documentary was released online and the hashtag #IndiasDaughter was trending in the UK after it aired. The documentary featured an interview with one of the men convicted in an infamous 2012 gang rape case that sparked massive outrage and protests in India. An Indian court restricted the publication and airing of the film in India as well as the dissemination of excerpts from it after Mukesh Singh's comments were released in several media outlets. Singh appeared to show no remorse and blamed the rape victim for being out at night, according to the documentary called \"India's Daughter.\" \"The media is likely to be seen as a voice for the perpetrator of such crimes by providing him a medium to communicate his views on the matter repeatedly,\" said a letter sent to media outlets by the Indian government. Despite the ban, the documentary can be seen on YouTube in India. Singh told the documentary crew that his victim \"should just be silent and allow the rape.\" \"A decent girl won't roam around at 9 o'clock at night,\" he told the BBC. \"A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy. Boy and girl are not equal. \"Housework and housekeeping is for girls, not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things, wearing wrong clothes.\" He suggested that they \"had a right to teach them a lesson.\" In a statement, India's home minister said the documentary crew violated the conditions granting the jail interview, which stipulated that the authorities be shown all unedited footage. Home Minister Rajnath Singh told Parliament on Wednesday that permission would not be granted to anyone in the future to interview prison inmates after the uproar over the documentary. \"The government has taken necessary legal action and obtained a restraining order from the court disseminating the contents of the film,\" according to the statement. India's constitution guarantees free speech with a caveat that it could be restricted when speech is deemed a threat to public order, incitement to an offense or an act of contempt of court. In December 2012, a young woman was savagely attacked and raped by a group of men aboard a public bus in New Delhi and later died from her injuries. Mukesh Singh, who was driving the bus, is now on death row and has filed an appeal. His comments in the documentary have stirred fierce debate about whether airing his interview gives him a platform to share his misogyny, versus those who say it increases awareness and understanding of the horror of rape. The documentary's director, Leslee Udwin, wrote that she was \"deeply saddened\" by attempts to silence the film. \"India should be embracing this film -- not blocking it with a knee-jerk hysteria without even seeing it. This was an opportunity for India to continue to show the world how much has changed since this heinous crime,\" she wrote for India's NDTV. Udwin later spoke to NDTV, urging everyone to watch the film before rushing to judgment on it. \"I appeal to the Prime Minister to not let it go out of hand because it is getting out of hand. Countries around the world will very soon be saying: 'How dare India ban a documentary that is in the public interest?' I urge you to see the film as soon as possible,\" she said. \"Please see the film and then talk about it.\" Several supporters of the film echoed the notion that even airing the repugnant views increases awareness and points to a more systematic problem. One said that it is the role of journalism to report \"on the sickness,\" and actress Freida Pinto asked: \"Airing the truth a crime? How?\" One journalist expressed concerns that the use of prior restraint amounted to censorship by the government and set a precedent. The debate in social media caused hashtags #NirbhayaInsulted and #IndiasDaughter to trend in India. Many criticized the documentary for giving rapists a platform to share their thoughts and justify rape. One asked why \"rapists are treated as celebrities.\" Lawyer and prominent feminist Indira Jaising called the filmmaker \"irresponsible.\" \"Creating public space for them, encouraging tolerance of any form of violence, what the film will do, it will project justifications for rape -- which I think is completely wrong. It's going on public view where young people will be seeing it, there's no guarantee these convicts won't be seen as natural role models for most.\" Many questioned how Udwin was able to obtain 16 hours of interviews with the imprisoned Singh. The home minister told the upper house of Parliament on Wednesday that no one would be allowed to \"leverage\" the 2012 gang rape for commercial purposes. He also said that the filmmakers violated the conditions for the shoot inside Tihar prison and that officials would determine who granted permission for the interview. One prominent feminist said she opposed airing the documentary because it infringed on India's laws. Singh and three other convicts are currently appealing their death sentences. Kavita Krishnan, secretary of the All India Progressive Women's Association, said she didn't have a problem with people viewing the film but said the timing was not appropriate. \"The concern is that the airing of the documentary will result in a media trial -- that will essentially leave the judiciary with no option but to uphold the death penalty,\" she said. \"My main problem, how can we screen this documentary when there's an appeals process underway?\" Krishnan suggested that the documentary's title, \"India's Daughter,\" inferred that Indians were badly in need of a rescue mission, leaving the impression of a \"white savior\" complex. \"India's Daughter\" is directed by Udwin, a British woman who spent two years on the project. She said she was inspired by the mass protests that followed the gang rape case in Delhi. Among the voices in the debate, some were critical of what they perceived as Western bias that depicts India as a place of misogyny when rape and sexual assaults are universal. \"I have tried to convey that while we in India are in fact engaged in confronting the violence and discrimination against women here, it does not help for people in other countries to imagine that such brutality is India's 'cultural' problem; that India's 'backwardness' is the problem; or that gender violence is 'worse out there in India,'\" Krishnan wrote. CNN's Madison Park reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh reported from New Delhi.","highlights":"\"Please see the film and then talk about it,\" filmmaker urges .\nNews channels warned not to air controversial documentary about rape in India .\nDebate centers on whether withholding film is censorship or prevention of repugnant views ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Hillary Clinton permanently deleted all the emails on the private server she used to do official business as secretary of state, the Republican lawmaker who subpoenaed the emails said late Friday. Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, chairman of the House committee investigating the attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, said Clinton's lawyer informed him of the news. \"Secretary Clinton unilaterally decided to wipe her server clean and permanently delete all emails from her personal server,\" Gowdy said in a statement. Gowdy had also asked that Clinton turn over her server to the State Department inspector general for an independent review. Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, said no. In his letter to Gowdy, Kendall said the former secretary of state \"chose not to keep her non-record personal emails.\" \"Thus, there are no ... e-mails from Secretary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state on the server for any review, even if such review were appropriate or legally authorized,\" he wrote. But she \"has maintained and preserved copies\" of work-related, or potentially work-related emails she turned over to the State Department late last year. Kendall did not specify whether the emails were kept in paper or digital form. In December, Clinton turned over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department. Clinton has asked that those roughly 30,000 emails be released to the public. State Department officials have said they will release them after they have been reviewed. \"Representatives of Secretary Clinton's office have been in touch with the committee and the State Department to make clear that she would like her emails made public as soon as possible and that she's ready and willing to come and appear herself for a hearing open to the American public,\" Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said in an email. Gowdy said it wasn't clear when Clinton erased the server, but it appears to have been wiped after October 2014, when the State Department asked Clinton to return her official emails to the department. The chairman subpoenaed Clinton's emails regarding Libya and, last month, the State Department turned over about 300 emails to the committee. Clinton did not have an official government email account, so her personal server was the primary repository for her emails during her time as secretary of state. \"Not only was the secretary the sole arbiter of what was a public record, she also summarily decided to delete all emails from her server, ensuring no one could check behind her analysis in the public interest,\" Gowdy said. But in his letter, Kendall said the federal law governing record retention requires that each federal employee individually decide what emails must be preserved. \"The manner in which Secretary Clinton assisted the State Department in fulfilling its responsibilities under the act is consistent with the obligations of every federal employee,\" Kendall wrote. Gowdy has also subpoenaed the emails of about a dozen Clinton aides at the State Department. That request is still outstanding.","highlights":"GOP lawmaker who subpoenaed the messages says they've been deleted .\nClinton says she's given work-related messages to State Department; lawyer says she deleted personal emails ."}
{"article":"(CNN)While Boston and other New England cities have suffered through their snowiest seasons, other parts of the country have some unexpected good news to go along with the record-breaking winter conditions. All that cold air and a stuck weather pattern are keeping tornadoes to historic lows so far this year. March is typically a transitional month, where warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico collides with cold Arctic air to produce severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. This year, however, the jet stream pattern responsible for all the cold air and snow in the East remains stuck in more of a winter mode. \"We're in a persistent pattern that suppresses severe weather, and the right ingredients -- moisture, instability and lift -- (have yet to come together),\" said Greg Carbin, the Warning Coordination Meteorologist with the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. The group is responsible for issuing the tornado and severe thunderstorm watches that warn the public of impending severe weather. So far this year it's been extremely quiet. By this time in mid-March the center would have issued 52 tornado watches nationwide. This year they have issued a paltry four. Both January and February were well below normal. March has been even quieter.  At a time where the tornado season usually ramps up considerably, there has not been a single report this month of a tornado. \"We are in uncharted territory with respect to the lack of severe weather\" Carbin said. In fact if we make it through the entire month of March without any tornado reports it would be a first, according to the center. There have been around 20 tornadoes reported since January 1, well below the 10-year average of 130 for the period from the beginning of the year until mid-March. This year comes on the heels of what was has been a welcome lull of tornadoes across the United States the past several years.  In 2014, we ended the year with a count of 881, well below the average of 1,253. Meteorologists don't fully understand why we have seen the recent drop in tornadoes, but one possible answer is the development of El Nino, a warming in the equatorial Pacific, which can influence weather patterns globally. Recent studies point to lower tornado counts in the United States during these events. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently said that a weak El Nino had developed. So while all agree this is good news so far this year, it is clear that it is no guarantee that the rest of the season will remain this quiet. Weather patterns can change quickly. In 1984, for instance, there was a very similar slow start through mid-March and the number of tornadoes ended up well above average by the end of June, according to data from the storm center. It's also important to note that even in years where the tornado counts are low, you can still have very violent tornadoes -- 2013 being a perfect example. The year ended being roughly 30% below normal for the number of tornadoes, yet included some of the strongest tornadoes on record. The twisters in Moore and El Reno, Oklahoma, occurred in May of that year with devastating results.

{"article":"(CNN)If ignorance is bliss, then America must be a pleasure junkie, because we sure are chasing that dragon. The most recent example:  A school in New York sought to celebrate \"National Foreign Language Week\" by having the pledge of allegiance read in a different language every day.  You get one guess as to what happened when it was Arabic day. Complaints came in from both Jewish parents and people who had lost family in Afghanistan, according to the school superintendent. What language do they speak in Afghanistan?   Not Arabic.  The main languages are Dari and Pashto.  Perhaps this complaint illustrates why we need more education, not less. Unfortunately, this wasn't an isolated incident.    Earlier this year in Florida, parents were up in arms because a school taught about Islam in a history class.  And, there are perennial stories about \"Americans\" offended by a Spanish recitation of the pledge. Because of the outcry, Pine Bush students will now not hear the pledge in Italian, Spanish, Japanese, or French, as planned. That they were deprived of such a pedagogical exercise is bad enough.  What is worse is that the school district felt that it had to apologize.  The district's statement was a surrender to ignorance. \"The intention was to promote the fact that those who speak a language other than English still pledge to salute this great country. We sincerely apologize to any students, staff or community members who found this activity disrespectful.\" Instead of the Pine Bush students learning about other languages and cultures, they learned that the \"heckler's veto\" and phony tales of \"offense\" trump open mindedness and the quest for knowledge.  At least they do in modern-day American education.  Perhaps this is a lesson best learned now, because once they get to college, it will be even worse. Our universities were once places where ideas were safe to flourish, and we went to question what we knew.  Today, they are places where disfavored ideas are all but banned.  According to students, Dixie State (Utah) bans posters that \"mock\" anyone, including former president Bush. Last year, Smith College's president apologized and there was a student outcry because students had \"hurt feelings\" when alumna Wendy Kaminer argued at a panel discussion moderated by the college president against using the euphemism \"the n-word\" in historical discussions. She believed that using the actual word, in context, was proper (and it is). Yes, censorship of ideas and speech is no longer a top-down or parent-driven phenomenon.  Now students themselves insist on being insulated from anything that might make them question their beliefs.  Instead of debating an anti-abortion protester, Oregon University students preferred to call the campus police -- who briefly took their side. George Will was slated to speak at Scripps College in a program specifically designed to challenge students' prevailing views.  But, since he challenged the feminist view of sexual assault on campus, Scripps pulled his invitation. When I went to college, I enjoyed challenging my beliefs.  I still do.  I hope that my children constantly do the same.  That is how we grow.  If we cannot tolerate foreign languages, or distasteful ideas, even in an educational setting, what hope do we have? When we have orthodoxy of thought, the very notion of liberty begins to shrivel up and die.  When the cry of \"I'm offended\" can shut down debate over philosophies, or learning about other cultures, or learning other languages, then what have our educational institutions become?  How much further will this enforced ignorance and orthodoxy need to go before education is just another word that comes untethered from its meaning? And the very inspiration for this column, a debate over the pledge of allegiance, makes the problem even more glaring.  A rote and thought-free-chant of mindless allegiance can't even be expressed in a different language?  Is America really so fragile that if a citizen proclaims \"fidelit\u00e0 agli Stati Uniti\" that it means anything less because it is in Italian? Perhaps this highlights more than the fact that we should step away from the brink of ignorance while we can.  Perhaps a good place to start is by doing away with enforced orthodoxy of thought and speech in the first place.  Perhaps a good place to do that would be by doing away with the pledge of allegiance itself. Perhaps if we pledged to uphold the Constitution, instead of a piece of cloth, we would be reminded of what really built this nation -- the Spirit of the Enlightenment. No views are so sacred that they need not be challenged.  Whether we are talking about learning to say the Pledge in Japanese, or hearing a speaker who challenges our beliefs, that is what education is about, not enforced ignorance.","highlights":"NY school district canceled its experiment with the Pledge for \"National Foreign Language Week\"\nMarc Randazza says the outcry over an Arabic version was a triumph of ignorance over education ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Serena Williams had a big decision to make earlier this year, and she wanted to run it by her parents. She was nervous. She wanted to see whether they would support her going back to Indian Wells, California, to play in a tournament she had skipped 13 times since winning in 2001. The last time she was there, she had been booed loudly and lustfully. The fans were upset and sensed some sort of conspiracy that she didn't have to face her talented older sister in the semifinals. Venus Williams had withdrawn 10 minutes before their match with a knee injury. Many fans didn't buy it and thought it was orchestrated to give the younger Williams a chance for extra rest. Two days later, during the championship match, Serena Williams, 19 at the time, was jeered when she did well and cheered when she fared poorly. Then days after the tournament, which she won, her father, Richard, told USA Today that as he and Venus walked down the stairs to their seats, people kept calling him the N-word and one man said: \"I wish it was '75; we'd skin you alive.\" Neither Serena nor Venus has played in the tennis tournament since. That will end Friday when Serena Williams, the world No. 1, faces Monica Niculescu, the 68th-ranked player in a second-round match. The end of the boycott took a lot of conversations with a lot of people, Williams told reporters Thursday. Two of the most important were with her parents. \"It was a really emotional time for me,\" she said, saying the prospect of the talks made her a little nervous. She told them she wouldn't go back if they didn't want her to go. But they both said to play. Her dad said it would be a big mistake not to come back, she said. Williams said her mother said, \"I will be there for you.\" Venus Williams, the No. 11 singles player, isn't playing in the tournament, but Serena Williams said her older sister was 100% behind her. She is \"very happy that I am here. And even encouraged me to come,\" Serena Williams said. Serena Williams announced her return to the event in a TIME magazine first-person piece in February, writing she would ended her boycott in the spirit of forgiveness. She said Thursday that she didn't just have to forgive the fans at Indian Wells. \"In order to forgive, you have to be able to really let go of everything. I kind of let go a long time ago, and I kind of forgave, but I wasn't at point where I was ready to come back,\" she said. The timing seemed right this year, she said. She added that she will be a little nervous in her first match at the BNP Paribas Open. Still she was \"looking forward actually to kind of stepping out on center court and letting the whole world know that it doesn't matter what you face -- whether it's something that wasn't right, something that hurt you, hurt your family. You can just come out and be strong.\" CNN's Chris Borg and Tom McGowan contributed to this report.","highlights":"In 2001, her father said the family was the subject of racial slurs .\nNeither Serena or Venus Williams has played in the tournament since .\nSerena Williams says playing shows the world you can be strong in the face of intolerance ."}
{"article":"New York (CNN)When prosecuting attorneys began their closing arguments in the terrorism trial of an accused al Qaeda operative on Monday morning, they spoke of blood. \"Blood.  Mangled bodies and dead families,\" said Assistant U.S.  Attorney Zainab Ahmad.  \"Abid Naseer was going to place a car bomb in a crowded ... shopping center and watch people die.\" Naseer, 28, is accused of communicating with al Qaeda and conspiring to attack the Arndale shopping center in Manchester, England, in April 2009. Naseer has maintained throughout the two-week trial that he is innocent, repeatedly denying all charges and insisting that he was in the United Kingdom to find a wife, not to plan an attack. The case is now in the hands of the jury, who began deliberations Tuesday.  Judge Raymond Dearie instructed the jury to \"judge the facts and the facts alone.\" Naseer is charged with three criminal violations: providing material support to al Qaeda, conspiring to provide material support for al Qaeda, and conspiring to use a destructive device in relation to a crime of violence. Prosecutors accuse Naseer of using email addresses with female names to communicate with al Qaeda in planning the bomb attack. The \"female-sounding\" email addresses were created to attract less attention, prosecutors say. Naseer, a Pakistani national, was in the United Kingdom on a student visa at the time of his arrest.  Prosecuting attorneys pointed to the fact that Naseer had dropped out of classes after only a week as further evidence of his guilt. Naseer had no intention of completing his studies because \"that was never the plan,\" Ahmad said, arguing that Naseer applied for a student visa as a means of entering the country to carry out the attack. \"If law enforcement hadn't stopped him, he would be the martyr in heaven he so wanted to be. If he had not been stopped, hundreds of men, women, and children would be dead,\" Ahmad said. The Manchester plot was allegedly part of a three-pronged plan that also included attacks on the New York City subway system and on a newsroom in Copenhagen. The New York plot originated with a man named Najibullah Zazi, who is believed to have corresponded with the same al Qaeda contact as Naseer.  Zazi pleaded guilty to terrorism charges and was the first witness in Naseer's trial. Naseer's 2009 arrest in England was part of a massive sweep in connection with an alleged plot to carry out bomb attacks in Britain. He was extradited in January 2013. A number of British intelligence agents -- disguised with makeup and wearing wigs -- testified that they tracked Naseer in 2009 as he visited the Manchester mall that was to be attacked. Prosecutors also accuse Naseer of using \"coded language\" in his emails to update al Qaeda on his progress. Email records show that Naseer sent an email on April 3, 2009, to a man named Sohaib, who Naseer says he met randomly in an online chatroom.  Records also show that Naseer used two email addresses to email Sohaib exclusively from public computers and used different email addresses on his personal computer for all other correspondence. The email address belonging to Sohaib has since been identified as one belonging to a member of al Qaeda. The April 3 email reads, in part, \"We both parties have agreed to conduct the nikah after the 15th and before 20th of this month. I have confirmed the dates from them and they said you should be ready between those dates.\" \"Nikah\" refers to an Islamic marriage ceremony.  Naseer was arrested in Manchester five days after sending the email. Prosecutors allege that the wedding ceremony Naseer mentions was coded language for an attack. The dates mentioned in the email, they argue, were not referring to a marriage, but rather Naseer signaling to al Qaeda when to expect the attack to happen. Naseer, who has been representing himself, denied all charges.  He told jury members that prosecutors were only able to produce circumstantial evidence, with no witnesses offering direct information of Naseer's role in the alleged plot. They also did not offer any outright proof of any link to al Qaeda or any other terrorist organization, he said. \"Did anyone come forward, take the stand, and say Abid Naseer is the one responsible?\" Naseer asked the jury. \"We all know the answer. It is a two-letter word: no,\" he said. Naseer argued that he dropped out of school because the courses, taught in English, were too difficult for him.  A 2008 trip to Pakistan, during which prosecutors allege Naseer received al Qaeda training, was really a trip to visit his ailing mother, Naseer said. He said that he had no knowledge at the time that Sohaib was connected to al Qaeda in any way, and simply thought he was chatting with someone he met online. All correspondence mentioning multiple women and the planning of a marriage were genuine, he said. \"[I was] young and a bit desperate and wanted to settle down,\" Naseer said, noting that there was nothing out of the ordinary about his search for a wife. Naseer spent the majority of his closing argument reading from transcripts from earlier testimony, highlighting pertinent quotes he felt supported his cause. \"We're not here to speculate, we're here to prove facts,\" he said. Evidence in the trial included documents seized from a 2011 raid in Abottabad, Pakistan, in which Osama bin Laden was killed. \"Striking America at home is of the highest and top importance and is the main way to reach what we want,\" one letter said. \"The impact on Americans from a strike inside America cannot be compared with hitting them outside the country.\" Naseer is not mentioned by name in any of the seized documents.  He says he \"had no involvement in the activities mentioned.\" FBI Agent Alexander Otte, who oversaw the evidence collected in the raid, testified before the jury that he watched as military forces walked off a plane with bags of seized evidence and the body of Osama bin Laden. Other witnesses included multiple police officers and detectives from the Manchester and London police departments, forensic investigators, a linguistic specialist and an al Qaeda expert.  Surveillance officers who observed Naseer for several weeks prior to his arrest also testified. The jury must reach a unanimous vote of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt for a guilty verdict.  If convicted, Naseer faces life in prison.","highlights":"Jury deliberations in the Abid Naseer terrorism case begin after two weeks of testimony .\nNaseer is accused of supporting al-Qaeda and conspiring to bomb a shopping center in England ."}

{"article":"London (CNN)An 18-year-old British man has been arrested on suspicion of preparing to join ISIS in Syria, UK police say. Counterterrorism officers arrested the man at his home in Hodge Hill, in the city of Birmingham, early Monday, West Midlands police said. \"The operation was pre-planned and intelligence led. There was no immediate threat to public safety,\" they said in a statement. The arrest follows that of three teenagers from northwest London on Sunday after they were intercepted by Turkish police in Istanbul. The two 17-year-old boys and a 19-year-old man were arrested \"on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts,\" the Metropolitan Police said. They have since been released on bail. The investigation started Friday, after police learned the two 17-year-olds were missing and were believed to be traveling to Syria. They were traveling with a 19-year-old, police said. British authorities shared intelligence regarding the 17-year-olds with Turkish officials Friday, and that night, they landed in Istanbul on a flight from Barcelona, Spain, a Turkish official told CNN. The teens were stopped with another person seen as suspicious by Turkish intelligence at the airport's risk analysis center, which monitors risky flights and runs checks on suspicious passengers trying to enter Turkey. Turkish authorities questioned the teens, the Turkish official said, and the Metropolitan Police said the three returned to London shortly before midnight Saturday and were arrested. Last week, Turkish authorities said they had arrested a  person -- working for an undisclosed nation's intelligence service -- on suspicion of helping three British girls who are thought to have entered Syria to join ISIS. British police say they think the three east London classmates -- Shamima Begum, 15; Kadiza Sultana, 16; and Amira Abase, 15 -- traveled to Syria after flying from London to Istanbul on February 17. Metropolitan Police on Monday announced a new media campaign to deter young people from traveling to Syria. Radio and press advertisements highlighting the influence a mother could have on her daughters would be placed in ethnic minority media, police said. The campaign said that it was mothers who often noticed changes in behavior that could signal an intention to travel to Syria, they said. There was increasing concern about the number of women traveling to Syria, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball said. \"It is an extremely dangerous place, and the reality of the lifestyle they are greeted with when they arrive is far from that promoted online by terrorist groups,\" she said. \"The option of returning home is often taken away from them, leaving families at home devastated and with very few options to secure a safe return for their loved one,\" Ball said.","highlights":"Metropolitan Police announce a media campaign to deter young people from traveling to Syria .\nThe Birmingham man, 18, was detained at his home in a preplanned operation, they say .\nPolice said there was \"no immediate threat to public safety\""}
{"article":"(CNN)A group of foreign medical students are thought to have traveled to Syria to work in ISIS-controlled hospitals, a Turkish lawmaker told CNN Sunday. The group of 11 people includes seven Britons, an American, a Canadian and two Sudanese, Mehmet Ali Ediboglu said. Ediboglu, an opposition Turkish lawmaker, told The Observer that he had spoken with the students' families, who were convinced their loved ones wanted to work for ISIS and were asking him for help tracking them down in neighboring Syria. \"They have been cheated, brainwashed. That is what I, and their relatives, think,\" Ediboglu said, according to the newspaper. But he also stressed that the group did not travel with the intention of joining the battle. \"Let's not forget about the fact that they are doctors,\" he told The Observer. \"They went there to help, not to fight.\" Eight of the group are medical students who've just graduated and three others are in their final year of medical school, he said. They'd been studying in Khartoum, Sudan. Now, at least seven of their mothers and fathers are living near the Turkey-Syria border, pleading for their return, according to The Observer. In an interview published Monday in Turkey's H\u00fcrriyet Daily News, the group of parents said they were worried and vowed not to leave Turkey without their children.

{"article":"(CNN)Hillary Clinton worked hard last week to put the \"dead end\" sign on the State Department email story by announcing there was nothing to find. But in her rush to control the narrative, Clinton may have (once again) missed the bigger picture: In politics as much as in business, authenticity matters. Her press conference had the familiar ring of a controlled performance -- the carefully parsed explanation, the combative posture -- that stretched our belief that what she's telling us is really the whole story. People wonder: Is she playing it straight with us? Why the nagging suspicion that Brand Hillary does not include bringing to the public table who she really is? As the author Joe McGinniss reported in his classic book on the 1968 Nixon campaign, \"The Selling of a President,\" political consultants long ago began marketing candidates like bars of soap. The practice has accelerated since the '60s as campaigns have concluded that political brands face the same tests among voters that consumer brands do among customers. And among consumers today, authenticity means more to success than at any other time in the history of brands. The desire for authenticity is a tangible driver of revenue for brands. Increasingly, people want to give their money to brands -- political as well as commercial -- that have a set of values they can also buy into. As author James H. Gilmore told The New York Times, a sense of authenticity reinforces trust in what is real \"in an increasingly staged, contrived and mediated world.\" A recent global study found that 63% of consumers would buy a brand they perceive as authentic over its competitors, and more than 60% would recommend an organization they perceive to be authentic. Ignoring the importance of authenticity to voters is a significant risk, as both Mitt Romney and Al Gore learned too late. And they were running in a perceptual environment more forgiving than today's. Voters easily identified the space between who these candidates really were and how they wanted us to perceive them. Romney, the successful entrepreneur and moderate politician, struggled to seem ordinary and \"severely conservative,\" while Gore was perceived as having such an overblown sense of himself that the claim of having invented the Internet stuck to him like mud, even though he'd never said it. The two shared what will likely also be Clinton's destiny: winning a party nomination by default as there were few compelling alternatives. For Clinton, an uncontested rise to the Democratic nomination could mislead her campaign into believing that she doesn't have a problem with authenticity. She does, especially among Independents and Republicans. To be fair, Clinton's appeal as potentially the first woman to reach the White House makes her seem virtually bulletproof among certain voting groups. A recent Gallup Poll shows \"first female\" status as the \"best thing about a Hillary Clinton presidency,\" leading the positives mentioned by 30% of Democrats and 17% of Independents. But the next-closest best thing about Clinton is a long way off: Her experience is mentioned by only 16% of Democrats and 8% of Independents. A fledgling campaign apparatus, with powerful political recruits like John Podesta and Robby Mook and marquee brand wizards from Coca-Cola and Microsoft, might want to be looking hard at the dangerously lukewarm voter sentiment about experience and suitability that is lingering just beneath the surface of the \"first female president\" juggernaut. Part of the heightened danger coming out of her press conference lies among millennials, who will be a critical voting group for Democrats in the 2016 presidential election. And authenticity is of paramount importance to millennials in how they relate to everything in their lives, including politicians. As one commenter on a MediaPost article on millennials put it, \"If brands can't be authentic Millennials will call them on it. Want to win our hearts? A little self-deprecation and humility never hurt.\" Forty percent of millennials in the U.S. admit to full-blown cynicism about the way they are approached by brands of all kinds. According to the MediaPost article, authenticity and the allied trait of trustworthiness are two of the top brand attributes millennials look for before they make a decision to hand over their money and, one could argue by extension, their vote. These days, too, it's trickier than ever for brands to stay in step with the conversations that move people to make judgments. Whether they're consumers or voters, people are more in tune with each other than at any other time in human history. They can gang up more easily to support or reject a person, an idea, and, yes, a company, brand or politician. Brands are left on the outside looking in, puzzling out how to insert themselves into a meaningful relationship with constituents who can turn on them at any second. This trend of demanding more authenticity from brands they invest in, and rewarding brands for it, has been accelerating with consumers across the U.S. over the course of the very same seven years since Clinton last ran for president. Since consumers are also voters, it stands to reason that any political brand -- including Hillary Clinton -- should look even more seriously today at how to increase its value by focusing on perceptions of its authenticity.","highlights":"Martha Pease: Hillary Clinton struggled last week to put the email story behind her .\nPease: Consumers are increasingly valuing brands perceived as authentic.

{"article":"(CNN)Have Rick and his fellow survivors finally found a place they can settle in for the long term? That was the question left still unanswered at the end of Sunday night's season finale of \"The Walking Dead,\" and a finale record 15.8 million viewers tuned in to find out the answer. Rick was back in \"Ricktatorship\" mode, telling the residents of Alexandria that he knew what it took to survive and they should follow him. That led up to one of many moments where we gasped during the 90-minute finale. Here are five of the biggest gaspworthy moments: . 1. Morgan is back . We've literally been looking for him all season, and Rick's old friend Morgan -- going all the way back to the first episode -- made a return appearance, wielding a stick he used to kick walker, and human, butt when necessary. And it was definitely necessary once he was captured by two men wearing W's on their heads, who, we would later learn, wanted to turn Morgan into a walker in order to join a horde of walkers they controlled. 2. Daryl looks done for . It was Daryl who happened upon that horde, and he and Aaron were soon surrounded and forced into a car, with little chance of escape -- that is, until Morgan rescued them. We rarely believe what we hear when there are rumors that Daryl might die, but that was a close one. 3. Carol and her casserole . Melissa McBride continues to steal scenes left and right lately, and her threatening of Pete while lending him a casserole may be one of the best scenes in the series' history so far. 4. Glenn gets shot . We seriously thought Glenn was a goner after a vengeful Nicholas shot him, then left him for a large group of walkers to attack. Somehow, Glenn survived and attacked Nicholas, but stopped short of killing him. That's our Glenn, always doing the right thing when it comes down to it. 5. Rick's memorable walker encounter . Just when you thought you'd seen everything, Rick literally squeezed a walker's neck then discharged a round causing the walker to spray out blood -- a walker he presented to the residents of Alexandria, in a bid to lead them toward survival. Rick was then rudely interrupted by Pete, who slashed Reg's throat in a fit of anger. At that point, Deanna told Rick to off Pete, which he did. Phew! It was one of the most intense episodes of the already hyperintense series, and our group of survivors somehow made it through.

Things are packed into it like sardines. All of the life is squeezed in there. They lengthened it to 90 minutes because there's just so much. It's a supersized monstrosity.\" Her co-star Josh McDermitt added, \"There's so much good stuff in this episode they didn't want to do the hourlong version. I can't wait for people to see it. And personally, I think it's going to go down as one of the best episodes the show has ever done.\" 2. \"Call the Midwife,\" 9 p.m. ET Sunday, PBS . The fan favorite retro British series returns for a fourth season in the U.S. Though the ladies of  ladies of Nonnatus House may not be quite as big as \"Downton Abbey,\" fans of that series should enjoy this one. 3. \"The Dovekeepers,\" 9 p.m. ET Tuesday and Wednesday, CBS .

{"article":"(CNN)With tensions running high after the shooting of two officers in Ferguson, Missouri, state and county police took over protest security in the St. Louis suburb Thursday. St. Louis County Police and the Missouri State Highway Patrol are assuming \"command of the security detail regarding protests,\" St. Louis County Police said, while Ferguson Police will remain responsible for \"routine policing services\" in the city. The takeover came less than a day after two police officers standing guard outside Ferguson police headquarters were shot in what St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar called an \"ambush,\" spurring a manhunt for those responsible for targeting the line of officers. \"We could have buried two police officers,\" Belmar told reporters. \"... I feel very confident that whoever did this ... came there for whatever nefarious reason that it was.\" Belmar said several people \"have been very forthright\" with investigators, but authorities haven't released the names of any possible suspects. Investigators believe they have identified two people they want to question in the shooting, and one of them might be the shooter, a law enforcement official said. Police are also trying to find anyone who may have helped the shooter get away. This isn't the first time that county police and state troopers have stepped in to handle protest security. When clashes between police and protesters boiled over last year, Missouri's governor declared a state of emergency and tapped the State Highway Patrol to take over. After that emergency declaration expired in December, Ferguson Police resumed command of protest security. Officers from other agencies have continued to provide backup at larger protests. At a candlelight vigil Thursday night near the scene of the shooting, religious leaders led prayers for the wounded police officers and protesters. Dozens of demonstrators gathered again outside the police headquarters Thursday night. This time, Jeff Roorda of the St. Louis Police Officers Association said, the security situation on the streets is different. \"It's a very tense situation, as you can well imagine,\" he told CNN's \"The Situation Room.\" \"In my communications as a union official with police commanders, I've been assured that tactics will be different tonight. I assume that means not only more officers, but a wider perimeter, with coverage, perhaps, of these blind spots from which the shots were fired last night.\" Shots rang from a hill overlooking the station out shortly after midnight Wednesday, at the end of a protest against the Ferguson Police Department. Officers saw \"muzzle flashes ... about 125 yards away,\" Belmar said. Protesters have disavowed any ties to the shooting, saying the demonstrators believe in nonviolence. \"As the protest was dying down, someone, somewhere got violent. Now who they were and what group they were affiliated with, we don't know,\" said Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman. \"In no way are they representative of the thousands of people...who have been protesting.\" Belmar believes someone targeted the police, who have faced heated criticism for months, for a reason. \"These police officers were standing there, and they were shot just because they were police officers,\" he said. That department has been under fire since one of its officers, Darren Wilson, shot and killed black teen Michael Brown in August, and more recently since a scathing U.S. Department of Justice report came out documenting a pattern of racial discrimination. Police Chief Thomas Jackson resigned from his post Wednesday. While the demonstrators' focus was Ferguson, neither of the wounded officers works in that St. Louis suburb's Police Department. One is from Webster Groves, a city about 13 miles south of Ferguson. The officer -- a 32-year-old with seven years' experience -- was shot at the high point of his cheek, just under his right eye, Belmar said. The other wounded officer was hit in the shoulder and the bullet came out the middle of his back, Belmar said. He is a 41-year-old from St. Louis County Police who has been in law enforcement for the past 14 years. Both men were treated and released from St. Louis' Barnes Jewish Hospital. Brown's parents condemned the shooting as \"senseless,\" saying such violence against law enforcement \"will not be tolerated.\" So did the White House, with a tweet signed with President Barack Obama's initials offering prayers for the wounded officers and calling \"violence against police ... unacceptable.\" And U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who visited Ferguson in the aftermath of Brown's shooting and unrest that spurred, decried what happened as a \"heinous and cowardly (and) repugnant attack.\" \"What happened last night was a pure ambush,\" Holder said. \"This was not someone trying to bring healing to Ferguson. This was a damn punk who was trying to sow discord.\" Iresha Turner says police banged on her door in the middle of the night. \"I opened the door and stood back. I look at my chest, there's a red dot on it,\" she said. \"I have my hands up, start crying. I said, 'please, don't shoot me.\" Turner was one of three people who were questioned for hours by investigators Thursday and eventually released. But they never saw the shooting and had no idea who opened fire, she said. Turner thinks police questioned her because she was in a car of people who sped away after the shooting -- not because they had anything to do with it, she said, but because they were scared after hearing gunshots. It's not known what connection, if any, the shooter or shooters had to Wednesday night's protest. One irony is that, for some protesters, Wednesday was a day to celebrate: They'd called for Jackson's resignation for months, and finally it was happening. But for others, it was not enough. That's why they congregated in Ferguson, to demand changes like disbanding the city's entire Police Department and ousting Mayor James Knowles. Some chanted, \"Racist cops have got to go.\" Others held signs with slogans such as \"They don't really care about us!\" and \"Black lives matter.\" \"It was a great group (with) great, great energy,\" protester Markus Loehrer said. Three were arrested in a crowd Belmar characterized as agitated and \"pretty rowdy\" at times. Demonstrator DeRay McKesson told CNN that one fight that occurred had nothing to do with the protests. At its peak, some 150 protesters congregated Wednesday night in front of the Ferguson police station, Belmar said. About 70 law enforcement officers from multiple departments came in to stand in front of the station, as they have on many other nights -- with the turnout of demonstrators the highest since the November grand jury decision not to indict Wilson. There's the manhunt, of course. And then there's the likelihood of more protests and the possibility of more violence as well. Even though Jackson, City Manager John Shaw, Ferguson's top court clerk and two police officers are gone or on their way out, some activists are vowing to keep pressing for change. \"We aren't satisfied with this,\" Reed said of the police chief's exit. \"It's a step in the right direction, but it's not what total justice looks like in Ferguson.\" Jackson expressed optimism that, in his view, the Justice Department report concluded that Ferguson \"can do the tough work to see this through and emerge the best small town it can be.\" But what are the prospects after Thursday's shooting? Loehrer worried that the shooting will undercut the protesters' message against discrimination and violence. \"It's a shame that somebody had to take advantage of this great group,\" he said, \"to do something so despicable.\" And Belmar said it underscores the fact that, eight months after Brown's death, the streets of Ferguson are still simmering and law enforcement officers there are on edge. \"This is beginning at times to be very difficult for any law enforcement agencies, anywhere, to really wrap their arms around,\" he said. \"I want everybody ... to understand how difficult this is.\" CNN's Holly Yan, Joe Sutton, Sara Sidner, Jason Carroll, Shimon Prokupecz, Evan Perez, Don Lemon and Tina Burnside contributed to this report.","highlights":"Protests resume outside Ferguson's police headquarters .\nInvestigators identify two they want to question; one might be the shooter .\nState troopers and county police will take over protest security ."}

Pacquiao was the first to address the crowd, as his promoter Bob Arum watches on . Mayweather then took to the stage to address the crowd and insist he has never wanted to win a fight more . LEONARD ELLERBE (CEO of Mayweather Promotions): 'We are very excited to be making history today by officially announcing the biggest event in boxing history and one of the biggest sporting events ever. 'I'd like to thank Floyd and Manny for the role they played in making this happen - that meeting in Miami was a major milestone.' BOB ARUM (CEO of Top Rank): 'It is great to be part of an event which so elevates the sport of boxing.\u00a0When we compare it to other events - major events like the Superbowl, even the Olympics - we get worldwide attention to those events, and it's been rare that worldwide attention focuses on a boxing match.

STEPHEN ESPINOZA (Executive VP of Showtime Sports):\u00a0'We are not at all surprised that this fight is happening. As soon as we closed our deal with Floyd back in 2013, the Pacquiao fight was a top priority both for Floyd and for us. 'Whenever it was time to discuss a Mayweather opponent, Manny Pacquiao was always high on Floyd's list.

{"article":"The Harry Kane show continues at Tottenham. His first Premier League hat-trick against Leicester on Saturday ensured Spurs stayed in the hunt for a top-four finish. It's 29 for the season now. Will he score his first for England in the coming days? After another virtuoso display, in front of Roy Hodgson, he'll almost certainly be presented with his England debut. Tottenham striker Harry Kane scored his first ever Premier League hat-trick against Leicester on Saturday . Kane scores his and Spurs' third goal during the 4-3 win over Leicester at White Hart Lane on Saturday . Tottenham manager\u00a0Mauricio Pochettino believes that Kane has kept his head on his shoulders . Harry Kane is the first Spurs player to score a Premier League hat-trick since Gareth Bale in December 2012. It's keeping your feet on the floor time for Tottenham's talisman after a fairytale breakthrough campaign. When he trains alongside Wayne Rooney and Co for the first time this week you'd forgive Kane if his ego inflates somewhat. However, his club manager Mauricio Pochettino insists there's no danger of Kane turning into a Big Time Charlie. 'I think he's a very humble person,' said the Argentine. 'From the beginning of the season I think he impressed us with his human side. His mentality is that he always wants to improve, he never complains. 'I think it's a perfect mentality to develop his skill. You can it feel from the beginning with some people, they're are humble and they improve. 'Kane has the right mentality. I think always our job is to try to improve our players but Harry Kane is Harry Kane because he's Harry Kane.' Kane's superb form for Tottenham this season has culminated in a first call-up to the senior England squad . If he scores again, Kane would be the first Spurs player to score 30 goals in a season since Jurgen Klinsman . Pochettino's chirpiness is likely to subside should his striker pick up an injury during the international break. Kane, obviously, will be vital to Pochettino as his side continue with their Champions League charge. Barring a miraculous dip in form or injury, Kane is virtually certain to become the first Spurs player to score 30 goals in a season since Jurgen Klinsmann during the 1994-95 season. Surely individual honours await Kane, even if Champions League football doesn't. 'Can Kane win the player of the year? I don't know, I think Harry is today, a player who people prize a lot,' said Pochettino. Following his hat-trick against Leicester on Saturday, Kane was awarded with the match ball . 'I think that this season Harry has a big impact in the English football. I think that he's one of the better English players so far. 'He works hard, he's improved his game and is always available in the training. Harry Kane deserves his moment. 'Am I worried about him picking up an injury on England duty? No, I think it's a very good thing for him. It's a very good moment to be in national team.' Pochettino, however, is concerned about the fitness of his goalkeeper Hugo Lloris who needed stitches in a knee wound following a hefty collision with team-mate Kyle Walker in the second minute on Saturday. Spurs medical staff will make checks on the wound this week but the injury will rule him out of France's games against Brazil and Denmark. Though the keeper's wife, Marine Lloris, eased fears that the keeper will face long spell on the sidelines by tweeting: 'Hugo needs to rest bit but he will be back really soon.' Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris picked up an injury during his side's 4-3 win over Leicester at White Hart Lane .","highlights":"Harry Kane is having a fantastic season for Tottenham, scoring 29 goals .\nThe striker scored his first Premier League hat-trick against Leicester .\nSpurs boss Mauricio Pochettino insists that Kane remains very humble .\nKane has recently earned his first senior call-up to the England squad .\nREAD: Tottenham should not put cash before Harry Kane's England dream .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Tottenham Hotspur news ."}

{"article":"Leicester, England (CNN)\"God save King Richard!\" A cry rings out in the bright spring air as the simple oak coffin of Richard III is carried away from the tower block-filled campus of the University of Leicester for the final time. The medieval monarch's skeleton has been kept at the university since its discovery beneath a council car parking lot in the city sparked excitement around the world in August 2012. But on Sunday the bones -- which have been studied by archaeologists and experts from all fields in the years since -- ended their tenure as scientific specimens and became, once more, the mortal remains of a king. Some 35,000 people lined the streets of Leicester and the surrounding towns and villages as the cortege wound its way through the countryside to the site of Richard's final battle, Bosworth, where he died in 1485, before returning to the city for a commemoration at Leicester Cathedral. The day began on the freshly-mown lawns in front of the university's Fielding Johnson Building, where a crowd gathered for a solemn service of farewell, dignitaries dressed in their Sunday best alongside students and local families clad in jeans and waterproof jackets in case of a March shower. Leicester University student Anna Boyer, from North Carolina, said she and her classmates had come to watch the ceremony \"so I can say I was here,\" adding: \"It's an important historical event -- we don't have things like this in the States.\" Leicester alumni Sara and Leeroy Paskell brought their daughters Saoirse, 6, and Orlaith, 9, to watch the cortege pass by. \"We thought it would be nice for the children to see it,\" said Sara Paskell. \"It is amazing to be part of history, it makes me really proud of the university and of Leicester.\" That pride is something which those who helped in the search for Richard III share. Leicester University's president and vice-chancellor Paul Boyle said the discovery of the bones had been a \"defining moment\" which \"reshaped history,\" and pointed out that the university had been custodian of Richard III's remains for longer than he ruled England. Genetics expert Turi King, who proved the identity of the bones by matching their DNA to a living relative of the monarch, Michael Ibsen, said: \"It has been an amazing project to be part of -- we all feel very privileged to be involved.\" King, who read Robert Frost's poem \"The Road Not Taken\" at the university service and laid a white rose -- a reminder of Richard's heritage as a member of the House of York -- on the coffin, said she considered the commemorations the end of a chapter in his story, but not the end of the story itself; she is still working to sequence his entire genome. Michael Ibsen and another living relative of Richard III, Wendy Duldig, were there as the hearse carrying the coffin pulled away from the somber grey-brown bricks of the Fielding Johnson Building; accompanied by archaeologist Richard Buckley, who led the dig which uncovered the King's bones, they walked silently behind as the cortege's journey began. Thousands of people lined the route of the procession, out through the Leicestershire villages visited by Richard III on his way to the Battle of Bosworth. Perched on fold-up picnic chairs they gathered on roadside verges, along pavements decorated with bunting, flags and paper chains of white Yorkist roses, and in pub car parks to be entertained by folk dancers as they waited for the coffin to pass by. At Fenn Lane Farm, thought to be the closest location to the spot where Richard III died, earth from three key points in his life was placed in a casket carved with his symbol, a boar. The casket, and the procession, then made their way to Bosworth, where they were greeted by men dressed in medieval armor. Here, Richard's role as a \"warrior king\" was commemorated and tributes were paid to the others who died fighting alongside him. A beacon, which will burn until he is laid to rest on Thursday, was lit on the battlefield. Back in Leicester, thousands more gathered around the cathedral and in nearby Jubilee Square. Waiting to go in to the service, Judy Ellis, from the nearby town of Hinckley, said there was a \"real buzz\" around the city. \"It's quite exciting, coming over on the train I met people who'd come from all over the world to be in Leicester today.\" Ellis, who named her son Richard, said she had used the parking lot where the king's remains were found. \"Four days before the dig started I parked my car over that grave!\" she said. Adults -- some carrying single white roses and others wearing boar badges -- in village churches along the route watched the services play out on a big screen as children ran around in the late afternoon sunshine while they waited for Richard's return. In 1485, the defeated king's body was treated with little sense of occasion. It is said to have been slung naked over a horse and taken to Leicester, where it was put on display for three days before being hurriedly crammed into a too-small plot in the Grey Friars Church. More than five centuries on, those who sparked the search for Richard III's remains were determined to put right that ancient wrong by giving him a more fitting farewell. Philippa Langley, who led the \"Looking for Richard\" project, said its aim was \"to give Richard what he didn't get in 1485 ... to recognize what went on in the past, but not repeat it, to make peace with the past.\" To that end, the king's skeleton is to be given two things it did not have before: a coffin and proper burial rites. The coffin is a simple affair: English oak and yew, made by Richard's relative Michael Ibsen who, as chance would have it, is a cabinet maker by trade; it is carved with the king's name and a white rose. The burial rites are somewhat more complicated: they have entailed the rebuilding of parts of Leicester's cathedral, a guest list numbering into the thousands and delicate questions of location and religion. But with those puzzles overcome, the first of several high profile pre-reinterment services was held Sunday evening: The coffin was carried through the city on a gun carriage, accompanied by two \"knights\" in full suits of armor, riding on horseback, to the cathedral. Those who had gathered to pay tribute to Richard III threw roses into the procession's path as it passed the new visitor center which has been built over his original resting place. As the city's church bells tolled and dusk began to fall, the coffin was lifted onto the shoulders of the pallbearers and taken into the cathedral, accompanied by four official \"mourners\" -- descendants of some of those who fought with Richard at Bosworth. Once inside, it was covered with a heavily-embroidered cloth, and a Bible and specially-commissioned crown were laid atop the casket, the latter by a local Brownie, 9-year-old Emma Chamberlain, whose height meant a step had to be placed next to the coffin to allow her to reach it. In his sermon, the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Vincent Nichols alluded to Richard III's controversial reputation and \"tumultuous life,\" which had seen moments of \"astonishing brutality.\" Nichols said the king's short reign was \"marked by unrest and the fatal seepage of loyalty and support\" but insisted that he was also \"a man of prayer, a man of anxious devotion\" and one who had done good for his people. As those who had attended filed back out into the darkening spring evening, one final illuminated tribute was paid: the initials RIII and a crown were projected onto the cathedral's tower, while nearby, white roses surrounded a statue of the king. As she left the service, Victoria McKeown, who won a ticket to the event, said the experience had been \"brilliant\" and the memorial \"absolutely lovely.\" \"It's a lovely way to spend a Sunday evening -- not like being at home doing the ironing,\" she told CNN. \"It's part of history: I can say 'I've been to a king's funeral.'\"","highlights":"Richard III will finally be laid to rest in Leicester Cathedral this week .\nOn Sunday his remains were taken from the city's university to the site of his final battle, Bosworth .\nThe bones, in a coffin made by a living relative of the king, are now lying 'in repose' at the cathedral ."}
{"article":"(CNN)A video appears online. In it, fraternity members from your university are chanting a hateful, racist song about lynching African-Americans. The video goes viral. You're president of the university. Imagine being in that situation. What would you do? There are two ways to answer the question. The first is in the moment of crisis. The second is about the long term. As most everyone knows by now, David Boren,  president of the University of Oklahoma, faced just this situation Monday. And I've been thinking about it intensely,  not only because I care about race and civic leadership in America, but also because Boren was my first boss, when he was a U.S. senator. I'm not from Oklahoma but ended up working for Boren through a college internship. He was a mentor to me during my years in Washington, and a model for me when he left the Beltway to be of greater use and service as an educator. Though we haven't talked since the crisis broke, I see familiar patterns of leadership. Boren responded to the crisis swiftly, with a statement that went viral. Boren told the students from Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) he had a message for them: \"You are disgraceful. You have violated all that we stand for. You should not have the privilege of calling yourselves Sooners\" (the OU nickname). Boren went on to sever all ties between OU and SAE. The national fraternity closed the local chapter. Later, Boren said he'd be glad if the students in the video left campus because \"we don't provide student services for bigots.\" The next day he expelled two of them. His actions have resonated across the country. On social media, people shocked by the video find themselves also stunned by Boren's response. Why? Because he did something rare in public life today. He expressed a decisive, judgmental view with moral clarity. Then he followed through. His statements have been free of mushy lawyer-talk or euphemism. He's led authentically, from the heart. Of course, people have carped. Some question whether Boren has the legal authority, as head of a public institution, to expel students on the basis of their free speech, even racist hate speech. Some lament that what he should have branded as disgraceful was the students' actions, not the students themselves. Legitimate concerns, perhaps. The First Amendment question, certainly, is being debated by legal scholars. But these concerns are eclipsed by the bigger picture. Boren wasn't just condemning wrongdoers; he was shifting social norms for all. A cynic might consider laughable a refrain from Boren's statement about \"real Sooners.\" Boren said that real Sooners are not racists or bigots; they believe in equal opportunity, treat people with mutual respect and love each other like family. A cynic might say Oklahoma is a state both very white and very red, not known for flying the banner of anti-racism. Indeed, the original Sooners were the white settlers who raced in to claim land that had been wrested from Native Americans. But the point of Boren's \"real Sooners\" riff is not to describe or sanitize today's reality; it is to issue a challenge. It is to bind people to a creed, a standard of being and belief that is easy to assert but hard to achieve. Not unlike being a true patriot. So now begins the longer term. Here, another opportunity arises to lead by example. David Boren can now examine the institution he works for and ask how and why such attitudes and behaviors -- racism so casually vicious -- could ever take root among people as young as freshmen. He can explore the ways in which everyone -- not only the obviously guilty parties at a frat party -- is touched by unconscious bias and institutional racism. He can now ask his community to face the inequities of history and race. We can all do that. Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, is doing this at his company. He was moved after the incidents of Ferguson and Staten Island to hold truly open forums with employees about the pain and anguish of racial division. But you don't have to be a college president or a CEO. You don't have to be a white man in charge to start a tough reckoning with racism (though it'd help if more did). Whoever you are, you can start a new kind of conversation in your neighborhood. On your campus. At your house of worship. Ask what the history is. Ask why there are such imbalances of power and voice. Ask what it would take to be truly inclusive. Then, in word and deed, start answering your own questions. We can all do that. The sooner, the better.","highlights":"David Boren, president of the University of Oklahoma, responded to offensive video .\nEric Liu: Boren did something rare in public life today -- he acted with moral clarity ."}
{"article":"Connor Wickham has admitted Sunderland's misfiring strikers deserve the criticism they are getting. The Black Cats have managed only 23 goals in their 28 Barclays Premier League fixtures to date this season, a return which has left them perched perilously close to the relegation zone as the season reaches crunch-point. Perhaps even more worrying is the fact that Gus Poyet's pool of frontmen has contributed just nine of those goals, a record Wickham knows simply has to improve if they are to avoid a second successive scramble for top-flight survival. Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe has only managed two goals since his January arrival from FC Toronto . 'I wouldn't say the criticism of the strikers is unfair,' admitted Wickham, speaking to the Northern Echo. 'Strikers are going to get the most at any club because they are the money-makers, they are the ones that the fans are relying on to score the goals. That's where the criticism can come. 'Chances come and you do need to put them away. We are creating chances. The way we set up, we are setting up to attack at times when we get the ball. We do try to break as quickly as we can when we get the ball. Connor Wickham, who has scored just three league goals this season, says Sunderland attack must do better . Wickham, 21, scored one of his three Premier League strikes this term against champions Manchester City . 'We have done it in games but we have to get more consistent with it and get in to the box more. We will climb away from the rest of the group down there if we can start to put our chances away.' Scotland international Steven Fletcher is currently leading the way for the strikers with four goals - the same number as midfielder Adam Johnson - with Wickham having managed three and January arrival Jermain Defoe two. Danny Graham is yet to score for the club, while Jozy Altidore, who left the Stadium of Light for Toronto in an exchange deal with Defoe in January, did so having found the back of the net just three times in 52 appearances in all competitions. Sunderland face Aston Villa - the only Premier League club to have scored fewer goals with just 15 to date - at the Stadium of Light on Saturday with three points crucial for both sides. Villa, who ended a run of seven league defeats on the trot with a 2-1 home victory over derby rivals West Brom on March 3, currently sit three points clear of the bottom three with their hosts a point better off. Steven Fletcher and Jermain Defoe will be hoping for better luck in front of goal when they play Aston Villa .","highlights":"Barclays Premier League strugglers have scored just 23 goals in 28 games .\nOnly nine of those goals have been scored by Sunderland's strikers .\nWickham, 21, scored his last goal in January against Burnley .\nSunderland face Aston Villa at Stadium of Light in their next game .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Sunderland news ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Kids, being kids, like to climb on things. More often than not, that's OK. But when the thing in question is a war memorial? That's the question burning up online parenting groups and in family rooms after an amateur photographer snapped a picture of two children scampering on top of the Vietnam Women's Memorial in Washington. The photographer, Matt Munson, described the shot on Facebook as \"two little brats climbing over war memorial right in front of a veteran.\" The parents, he said, were laughing. \"It actually drew a crowd of spectators and the parents realized how evil they were being and quickly took off before I could take a picture of them all,\" Munson wrote. \"The more I look at this photo the angrier I get.\" He has plenty of company there. As the photo went viral, comment after comment poured in on Facebook and Twitter, chastising the parents for allowing the kids to play on the statue, part of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial that depicts three women tending to a wounded soldier. One nurse cradles the wounded fighter while another looks despairingly into an empty helmet. The third looks skyward, to a rescue helicopter or perhaps God, according to the memorial foundation's website. In Munson's photo, a visitor to the memorial seems to grimace at the sight as he pushes an older man in a wheelchair. The older man, wearing a Navy ballcap, and a woman also look on. The children's parents aren't shown. Disgusting. \"Disgusting,\" Facebook user Trisha Davidson wrote of the children's actions. \"So wrong,\" Twitter user karsonwithak chimed in. But not everyone was upset. \"I fully take why people can get annoyed and respect that,\" Reddit user z3k3 wrote. But the writer said a grandfather who was a veteran of World War II \"loved watching the kids play on the local memorial.\" \"He saw it as a way for the next generation to take some joy out of something so terrible and at the same time gave them a link to the past as many would stop to read the names or even get interested enough to read up on the subject a little,\" z3k3 wrote. Fair enough, some said. But some memorials are meant to be interactive. Others aren't. And a statue depicting a nurse caring for a gravely wounded man just doesn't seem to be the place for play, a Reddit user with the screen name nickfree wrote. \"Unless the memorial is designed to be climbed on -- unless the message of the memorial is clearly 'use me, interact with me, to help carry my message' (e.g. memorial benches), the default is leave it respectfully alone,\" nickfree wrote. On the Mommyish parenting blog, associate editor Maria Guido wrote that \"there's nothing wrong with children who may not understand how gleefully playing all over a memorial may seem inappropriate to some.\" \"If these kids were just doing that -- gleefully playing all over a memorial -- I wouldn't find anything wrong with the image, actually. But they're not,\" she wrote. \"These parents were disrespectful,\" she wrote. \"The kids were being kids and following their directives.\" Though the National Parks Service, which operates the memorial, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund urged visitors to treat veterans memorials -- sites of powerful and often emotional pilgrimages for many who served -- with respect. \"Please remember to be respectful to memorials honoring and remembering our nation's veterans,\" the group wrote on Facebook. \"We hope our visitors understand this moving forward.\"","highlights":"A photo of children playing on Vietnam Women's Memorial draws anger .\nMany say the kids and their parents were showing disrespect to veterans ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Robert Durst's wife mysteriously disappeared decades ago. It's an unsolved case that hasn't stopped haunting him. Years after she went missing, prosecutors argued Durst was hiding out from investigators digging into that case when he killed a neighbor, dismembered the body and skipped town. Jurors acquitted him in a high-profile 2003 murder trial after his lawyers said he'd acted in self-defense. Now the 71-year-old millionaire real estate heir from one of New York's wealthiest families is behind bars, accused of murder again in another case that some say is tied to his wife's disappearance. FBI agents arrested Durst Saturday night in New Orleans. Investigators say they believe he was behind the 2000 slaying of Susan Berman, a crime writer and Durst's longtime friend, who was shot dead in her Beverly Hills home. \"As a result of investigative leads and additional evidence that has come to light in the past year, investigators have identified Robert Durst as the person responsible for Ms. Berman's death,\" Los Angeles Police said in a statement Sunday. Police, who described him as a \"cold case murder suspect,\" didn't specify what new evidence pointed them toward Durst. The arrest comes amid heightened interest in the eccentric heir, who's now the focus of the HBO documentary series \"The Jinx,\" which explores whether he had any connection to his wife's disappearance and investigators' suspicions that Berman was killed because she knew what happened to her. Durst has long maintained he didn't kill Berman or have anything to do with his wife's disappearance. Investigators found him Saturday at the JW Marriott hotel in New Orleans, where he was staying under a false name and was carrying a fake driver's license, according to a law enforcement official who's been briefed on the case. He'd paid in cash, and authorities believe he was preparing to leave the country and flee to Cuba, the official said. He was jailed without bond and was awaiting an extradition hearing Monday morning. \"We will waive extradition and get to Los Angeles as soon as possible to answer the charges,\"  Chip Lewis, Durst's lawyer, told CNN on Sunday. Durst's brother said in a written statement that he was thankful for the arrest. \"We are relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst,\" Douglas Durst said. \"We hope he will finally be held accountable for all he has done.\" Accusations about what Robert Durst has done depend on who you ask. His one-time wife, Kathie Durst, went missing in 1982. No one has been charged in her disappearance. And according to The New York Times, she's been declared legally dead. Robert Durst has said the last time he saw her was when he dropped her off at a train station in Westchester, New York, so she could head back to medical school in the city. He secretly divorced her in 1990, Court TV reported. Her family has said Robert Durst is to blame for her disappearance and hailed his arrest over the weekend as a sign they could be close to getting answers. \"The dominoes of justice are now starting to fall,\" Jim McCormack, her brother, said on Sunday. \"Through our faith, hope and prayers the last domino will bring closure and justice for Kathie.\" This isn't Durst's first run-in with the law. In 2003, he admitted he'd killed and dismembered Morris Black, his neighbor in Galveston, Texas, but argued he'd shot Black in self-defense during a struggle. Prosecutors argued he'd planned Black's killing in order to steal his identity and escape the attention of New York investigators looking into his wife's disappearance. Durst testified that he hid out in Galveston and posed as a mute woman because he was afraid as he faced increasing scrutiny in the case, Court TV reported at the time. \"It seemed to me the big problem was Robert Durst,\" he said, referring to himself in the third-person. \"I wanted to not be Robert Durst.\" Durst is an heir to a fortune thanks to his family's New York City real estate investments. The Durst Organization was founded by his grandfather and is now run by his brother and cousin. After a civil lawsuit in 2006, Robert Durst cut ties with his family and 10 Manhattan skyscrapers in return for a $65 million settlement, The New York Times reported. In 2000, his friend and longtime confidant, Susan Berman, was killed in her California home. The killing, CNN's sister network HLN reported in 2012, occurred just after police reopened the investigation into Kathleen Durst's disappearance. \"She was a confidante of Robert Durst. She knew him well. They knew each other and were very, very close,\" CNN's Jean Casarez said. \"And it was just days before investigators were to fly out to California to talk with her about what she may have known about the disappearance of Kathleen Durst that she was shot execution-style in her living room.\" For years, speculation has swirled about who could be responsible for Berman's death. She'd written books about her family's mafia ties and explored the history of Las Vegas, and some suspected she might have drawn the ire of a killer through her work. Investigators in the past homed in on one key piece of evidence: a postcard sent to authorities that tipped them off that Berman's body was inside her home. A police handwriting analysis said the writing on that card looked like Durst's, author Miles Corwin told CNN in 2004. But Corwin, who shadowed investigators working on the case as part of his book \"Homicide Special: A Year With the LAPD's Elite Detective Unit,\" said at the time that police didn't have enough evidence to charge Durst in the killing. \"They don't have enough to arrest him,\" Corwin said in 2004. What's changed since then? In \"The Jinx,\" Berman's stepson reveals a letter from Durst he found among her possessions. That could be a key development, said Michael Daly, a special correspondent for The Daily Beast. \"You look at the letter, and the handwriting is astonishingly similar,\" Daly said. The Los Angeles County district attorney reopened the Berman homicide investigation last week. Investigators haven't said whether the documentary series played a role in this weekend's arrest. HBO, which is owned by CNN's parent company Time Warner, praised the series' director and producer in a statement Sunday. \"Years in the making, their thorough research and dogged reporting reignited interest in Robert Durst's story with the public and law enforcement,\" HBO said. CNN's Jack Hannah, Kyung Lah, Carma Hassan, Shelby Lin Erdman and Linh Tran contributed to this report.","highlights":"Wealthy New Yorker Robert Durst is jailed in Louisiana and will be extradited to Los Angeles .\nDurst was arrested in New Orleans on Saturday night .\nHe's accused in the cold-case killing of his longtime friend Susan Berman in 2000, LA police said ."}
{"article":"London (CNN)London teenager Brusthom Ziamani only converted to Islam in April last year. But by August he was arrested on suspicion of plotting to kill a soldier, police officer or government official, with a 12-inch knife and a hammer found in his backpack. Ziamani was convicted in February of \"engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts\" and sentenced Friday at the Old Bailey to 22 years in prison. It's a case with chilling echoes of the shocking murder by two Islamist extremists of soldier Lee Rigby, mowed down and hacked to death with a machete on a street in Woolwich, in southeast London, in May 2013. On the morning of his arrest, Ziamani had told his former girlfriend he intended to attack and kill soldiers. He also showed her the long-bladed knife and the hammer in his bag. Police who had searched his home two months previously had found a handwritten letter in which he glorified the murder of Rigby, and stated that \"we should do a 9\/11, 7\/7 and a Woolwich all in one day.\" Police said Ziamani, who was unemployed, had come under the influence of a banned London-based terrorist organization \"that it is believed played a major role in influencing and shaping his radical views.\" That organization is Al Muhajiroun, also known as ALM. Handing down the 22-year sentence, Judge Timothy Pontius said the police had put together a \"formidable and unassailable\" case against the teenager. \"Ziamani's coldblooded deliberation under the malign influence of ALM, of whom he was a willing student, showed in court that he was far from the naive adolescent that the (defense) tried to portray him as,\" he is quoted as saying in a police statement. \"He is a man of intelligence and independent and articulate mind. He was within hours of carrying out his intention of murdering a soldier, police officer or government official to imitate the horrifying savagery carried out by the killers of Lee Rigby.\" The letter that came to light when counterterror officers from London's Metropolitan Police searched Ziamani's address in June gave an insight into an extremist mind-set that already had violence in mind. Found in a pair of jeans, according to police, the letter was messily written with many misspellings. In it, he tells his \"beloved parents\" that what he's about to do is an obligation for Muslims and asks them to forgive him for all the stress he's caused them in the past. \"I'm a changed person,\" he said, saying he has to act to help his \"brothers and sisters\" in Syria and Iraq. Because he does not have the means to get to these countries, he will wage war against the British government here instead, he said, adding that it would give the authorities \"a taste of there (sic) own medicine.\" Ziamani admitted writing the letter and was arrested on suspicion of committing a terrorism offense. He was released on bail, allowing police to continue their inquiries. Police believe he converted to Islam in April 2014 and point to his postings on social media as evidence of his rapid radicalization. In May he posted \"Land of democracy = Evil,\" and in July he posted, \"Forget the protests, the only way to liberate Muslim lands is Jihad.\" On June 20, Ziamani had used his phone to visit websites researching the locations for army cadet bases across London, police said. While Ziamani was out on bail, officers tasked with trying to divert vulnerable young people from the path to radicalization tried to meet with him three times, but he declined to engage with them, police said. Commander Richard Walton of the Counter Terrorism Command welcomed the sentence, saying he was \"relieved an extremely dangerous individual\" had been removed from the streets. \"Ziamani was an impressionable young man who became radicalized, then rapidly developed an extremist, violent mind-set,\" Walton said. The work of police and intelligence officials had \"probably prevented a horrific terrorist attack taking place on the streets of London,\" he said.","highlights":"Brusthom Ziamani gets 22 years in prison in plot to kill a soldier, police officer or official .\nPolice found a knife and hammer in Ziamani's backpack when he was arrested ."}
{"article":"(CNN)There are two main ways visitors to Ho Chi Minh City cross the streets. One approach is to step with zen-like calm into the swirl of honking scooters and serenely stride across the road without breaking step. Like locals, they're part of the flow, part of the (exhaust-choked) stream of traffic. The other is to stand anxiously on the edge of the curb, toes curled like a diver's, waiting for a non-existent stoplight, then plunge into the melee while letting out a small yelp before slaloming across the street like a demented Frogger. Some, like Steve Mueller, would question why cross the road at all. If you can't beat them, join them. Which is what the South Carolinian did -- he now runs the city's Vietnam Vespa Adventures. It's a tour company that provides two-wheel thrills on the Italian vintage scooters, Vespa, around Ho Chi Minh City, out into the Mekong Delta and beyond. Being on a scooter in Ho Chi Minh is the best way to feel a part of the city, says Mueller. \"It's really an authentic experience,\" he says. \"Being side by side with the locals.\" Day tours take in popular sights like the Opera House and central post office designed by Gustav Eiffel, but also stop at local eateries and offbeat locations. One popular early morning pit stop is Tao Dan park where Ho Chi Minh City's bird fanciers puff themselves up like their caged pets in a display of tweeting one-upmanship. Unfortunately\/thankfully, you're not the one driving. All the mopeds are driven by local, experienced drivers who have no problem with the swarm of vehicles on the roads. A local tour guide rides along, too, to add context to the sights, smells and sounds experienced from the back of a two-stroke motor. Mueller took a circuitous route to setting up the company. After traveling around Southeast Asia in 1997 he settled in Vietnam the following year and discovered a glut of classic Italian scooters that needed a bit of TLC. He bought his first one after just three days in the country and spying an opportunity to tap into international Vespa enthusiasts' desire for authentic rides, set up a restoration and export business. It became so successful he was in danger of putting himself out of a job, so in 2006 he decided to start a tour company offering multi-day tours outside of Ho Chi Minh City. According to Mueller, his business was kick-started by Vietnam's appearance on the TV program \"Top Gear,\" which showed the country's beautiful countryside and underused roads. Longer trips are still offered by Vespa Tours, taking willing riders as far as the Vietnam Highlands and the coastal city of Nha Trang over seven days. Most of the scooters in Mueller's garage hark back to the golden age of Vespas, the late '60s and 1970s, refurbished with replacement parts from Piaggio-licensed machinists in India. True to their reputation, the 100 or so classic scooters owned by Vespa Adventures break down frequently -- mechanics are on hand for running repairs -- but Mueller believes its all part of the charm in a city where two wheels beats two legs.

{"article":"(CNN)The aircraft carrier USS Ranger, which saw action in the Vietnam War and Operation Desert Storm and had appearances in the movies \"Top Gun\" and \"Star Trek IV,\" is on its final journey, a five-month cruise at the end of a tow cable from Bremerton, Washington, to a scrapyard in Texas. The 56,300-ton warship, which was launched in 1956, was decommissioned in 1993 but kept in storage for possible reactivation until March 2004 when it was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and made available for donation to a group that could preserve it and turn it into a museum. But attempts by groups in Long Beach, California, and Fairview, Oregon, to do so came up short of meeting U.S. government requirements for donation. The Long Beach group called itself Top Gun Super Carrier in reference to the Ranger's role in the 1986 Tom Cruise movie. The carrier was used for interior shots in the film, which also featured appearances by the carriers USS Carl Vinson and USS Enterprise, according to Internet Movie Database. In December, the Navy paid International Shipbreaking of Brownsville, Texas, a penny to take the carrier off its hands. The shipbreaker makes its profit by selling the parts of the ship for scrap. The Ranger, which left Bremerton on Thursday, follows two of its predecessors in the Forrestal class of carriers -- the Forrestal and the Saratoga -- to scrapyards in Brownsville. Another carrier, the USS Constellation, part of the Kitty Hawk class, was towed to Brownsville last year. Like the Ranger, the Constellation was stored in Washington and because of its size had to be towed all the way around the southern tip of South America, as it would not fit through the Panama Canal. The Ranger's final journey is expected to take four to five months, the Navy said.","highlights":"Aircraft carrier USS Ranger's final journey likely will take four to five months, Navy says .\nRanger, which was launched in 1956, appeared in movies such as \"Top Gun\" and \"Star Trek IV\""}

Erich Nowsch Jr. faces charges of murder with a deadly weapon, attempted murder and firing a gun from within a car. Police say Nowsch shot Tammy Meyers, 44, in front of her home after the car he was riding in followed her home February 12. Nowsch's attorney, Conrad Claus, has said his client will argue self-defense. The Meyers family told police that Tammy Meyers was giving her daughter a driving lesson when there was a confrontation with the driver of another car. Tammy Meyers drove home and sent her inside to get her brother, Brandon, who allegedly brought a 9mm handgun. Tammy Meyers and her son then went back out, police said. They encountered the other car again, and there was gunfire, police said. Investigators found casings from six .45-caliber rounds at that scene. Nowsch's lawyer said after his client's first court appearance that Brandon Meyers pointed a gun before anyone started shooting. He said the family's story about a road-rage incident and what reportedly followed don't add up. After zipping away from the first shooting, Tammy Meyers drove home and the other car, a silver Audi, went there also. Police said Nowsch shot at both Tammy and Brandon Meyers.

{"article":"(CNN)A year-and-a-half ago, when the Jesus edition of Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard's ongoing book series about the deaths of famous people was released, O'Reilly did the talk show circuit to promote the book. To \"60 Minutes\" O'Reilly professed that his \"Killing Jesus\" is not a religious book. It was purely historical, said the Fox News host. He said it investigates the political circumstances surrounding the most famous death of all time. When asked why Jesus was killed, O'Reilly said, \"He was upset that the Jews were taxing -- and overtaxing, extorting -- the folks.\" Jesus was executed, according to O'Reilly, not because he claimed to be God, but because he interrupted the \"money flow\" of taxes to the Romans and the Jewish temple leaders. As a theologian, I must say that O'Reilly buried the lead. The death of Jesus of Nazareth, at least historically speaking, was just one more ignominious execution of a peasant Jew in a long line of such executions. A century before Jesus' death, the Romans crucified about 6,000 slaves on the roads leading to Rome, putting to an end the Third Servile War. Like Jesus, these slaves stood up to the Roman Empire and were quickly defeated. Crucifixion was common. Five things Bill O'Reilly flubs in 'Killing Jesus' Jesus' death was unique because of its theological and religious import. At least that's what his earliest followers decided upon reflection. Jesus was not the messiah that the Hebrews had anticipated. In fact, he'd done just about the opposite of what was expected: preached peace, lived in relative obscurity, and died young. Jesus was most definitely an outsider -- on this O'Reilly and I agree. He lived in the outer reaches of the empire, a non-citizen with few rights. Even his Galilean accent was considered backwoods in the metropolis of Jerusalem. Whether it was the Roman occupying force or the powerful temple leaders, they must have thought, \"Jesus is not like us.\" So it's pleasantly surprising that the TV movie based on O'Reilly's book casts a Muslim actor, Haaz Sleiman, as Jesus. Sleiman was raised in Lebanon. He is thick-featured and broad-shouldered. And he is robustly hirsute, the very opposite of the wispily-bearded Ted Neely from the Jesus Christ Superstar of my youth. Speaking of Ted Neely, he is just one in a long line of blue-eyed Jesuses in art and film. For a long time, the actors chosen to play Jesus have looked more like O'Reilly and me than like a Judean. Sleiman is a welcome break from that tradition, but some people have voiced displeasure at his casting. Having a Muslim portray the founder of Christianity, they contend, is an offense. Sleiman disagrees. \"My religion is inclusivity,\" Sleiman told me, and he is an effective evangelist of that religion. He is unashamed to talk about his connection to God, his respect for all three Abrahamic faiths -- Judaism, Christianity, and Islam -- and in the \"beauty and magnificence of humanity.\" To play Jesus, Sleiman said, he simply focused on the divinity that he believes is available to all human beings, a divinity that Jesus was specially aware of. When Bill O'Reilly portrays Jesus as a champion of low taxes and an opponent of big government, he's not committing a mortal sin. He's doing what so many have done before: seeing in Jesus what they want to see, and making Jesus into someone who looks, talks, and thinks like they want him to. So maybe the best thing that Christians can do during this Holy Week is to watch a Muslim portray Jesus. In that portrayal, we might be reminded that Jesus himself didn't look like the dominant culture of his day, and he practiced a religion that the Romans did not understand or respect. We live in an uneasy time between Christians and Muslims, between Christianity and Islam. And it wasn't so different in the first century. Then, an obscure figure who was little understood preached peace and died a sacrificial death. Now a Muslim actor is bringing him to life, and that is no more scandalous than Jesus' own life.","highlights":"A TV movie based on O'Reilly's book \"Killing Jesus\" casts a Muslim actor as Jesus .\nMaybe best thing Christians during this Holy Week should watch  Muslim portray Jesus, says Tony Jones ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Although much of the United States has been shivering this winter, there's been another worrying sign of warming temperatures farther north.  The cap of sea ice that spreads across the Arctic Ocean in winter appears to have been the smallest on record this year, according to NASA. Not only was this year's maximum extent, reached on February 25, the smallest on the satellite record, it's also one of the earliest. Barring a late spurt of ice growth -- possible but unlikely, according to a NASA news release -- this sets a new precedent. The analysis is based on data from the NASA-supported National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Arctic sea ice, frozen seawater floating on top of the Arctic Ocean and its neighboring seas, is in a state of constant flux. It increases its area in winter, usually peaking between late February and early April, and then shrinks in the warmth of  spring and summer to reach its lowest extent in September. If this year's maximum extent, totaling 5.61 million square miles, was reached on February 25, it was reached 15 days earlier than the 1981 to 2010 average date of March 12, according to NSIDC. Only once before did the peak come earlier, by just one day in 1996. A peak of 5.61 million square miles is about 50,000 square miles below the previous lowest peak wintertime extent, reached in 2011, according to NSIDC. Scientists have been using satellite data to track changes in Arctic sea ice, a vital habitat for birds and marine mammals such as polar bears, seals and walruses, for over three decades. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Ted Scambos, NSIDC lead scientist, puts the potentially record low maximum sea ice extent this year down to low ice extent in the Pacific and a late drop in ice extent in the Barents Sea. Strong southerly winds in early March also played a role, according to NOAA. Only the Baffin Bay area and the waters around Newfoundland had more ice than normal this winter, it said. Scientists say it doesn't necessarily follow that a low maximum winter extent will mean a record amount of shrinkage in sea ice over the summer, however. While the winter sea ice extent was low in 2006 and 2011, neither of those years saw an unusually low summer minimum, NOAA said. \"The winter maximum gives you a head start, but the minimum is so much more dependent on what happens in the summer that it seems to wash out anything that happens in the winter,\" Walt Meier, a sea ice scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is quoted as saying by NASA. \"If the summer is cool, the melt rate will slow down. And the opposite is true, too: even if you start from a fairly high point, warm summer conditions make ice melt fast. \"This was highlighted by 2012, when we had one of the later maximums on record and extent was near-normal early in the melt season, but still the 2012 minimum was by far the lowest minimum we've seen.\" Meanwhile, the summer minimum ice extent reached in the Antarctic was one of the highest recorded, NOAA said. But this isn't cause for much optimism faced with evidence of a warming planet. \"Over the span of the satellite record, Arctic sea ice has been declining significantly, while sea ice in the Antarctic has increased very slightly,\" the NOAA news release said. \"Recent research demosntrates that the Antarctic gains do not balance out the Arctic losses: globally, sea ice extent has decreased over the past several decades.\" According to the NSIDC, sea ice in the Arctic appears to play a more important role in regulating global temperatures than that in the Antarctic.","highlights":"Scientists say Arctic sea ice appears to have set a record low maximum extent this winter .\nBarring an unlikely late surge in sea ice growth, the 2015 maximum is 5.61 million square miles ."}
{"article":"Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone has shown an interest in signing Paris Saint-Germain star Edinson Cavani, according to French newspaper L'Equipe. The 28-year-old, who joined the Ligue 1 side for a record-breaking \u00a355million back in July 2013, is a summer transfer target for Simeone as he looks to bolster the La Liga side's ranks. The Argentine recently spoke with the Uruguay forward, after being put in touch with Cavani through his international team-mate and Atletico defender Diego Godin. Edinson Cavani (right) - pictured on the front of L'Equipe - is reportedly a transfer target for Atletico Madrid . Tuttosport are reporting that Juventus are considering offering Carlos Tevez a contract extension . Cavani, nicknamed 'El Metador', has often been criticised for his level of performance since joining the French giants - scoring 15 goals in all competitions so far this season - with his contract set to run out in the summer of 2018. He would command a high transfer fee though, with it unknown whether the current La Liga champions would splash the cash to land the sought-after striker. Manchester United have also been linked with a \u00a360m move for Cavani, with Radamel Falcao flattering to deceive since joining on a season-long loan from Monaco. Elsewhere, in Italian newspaper Tuttosport they headline with Juventus considering offering in-form striker Carlos Tevez a new contract, amid interest from former side Boca Juniors. The 31-year-old started off his career with the Argentina outfit, and could be tempted for a move back to his homeland, after an impressive spell in Italy with Juventus. Marca headlines with coverage of the Copa del Rey, while Corriere dello Sport focuses on Juventus . In January he was quoted as saying he would honour the end of his contract at the Italian giants - which runs out in June 2016 - but was currently not interested in extending it. So far this season Tevez has notched 21 goals in 31 appearances, as Juve sit pretty nine points clear at the top of the table - as they close in on a third successive Serie A crown. In Corriere dello Sport they also focus primarily on Juventus, as Massimiliano Allegri's side look towards the Champions League and their last-16 second-leg tie against Atletico Madrid. Cavani, Marco Verratti and Daniele Rugani have all been mooted as potential signings as Allegri's side look to increase the size and quality of their squad in the summer. Finally, in Spanish newspaper Marca the focus is firmly on the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey. Barcelona take a two-goal lead into the second leg of their clash against Villarreal, while both Espanyol and Athletic Bilbao head into the decisive leg on level terms.","highlights":"Atletico Madrid are reportedly keen on a move for PSG's Edinson Cavani .\nDiego Simeone has spoken to the Uruguay striker, according to L'Equipe .\nElsewhere, Juventus are considering offering Carlos Tevez a new contract .\nTevez has scored an impressive 21 goals in 31 appearances this season ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Former Manchester United star Danny Welbeck returned to haunt his old side to send holders Arsenal into the semifinals of the FA Cup with a 2-1 victory at Old Trafford Monday. The England striker was surplus to requirements at Louis van Gaal's United, but was quick to capitalize on a mistake by Antonio Valencia to grab the winner just after the hour mark. A disappointing night for United was compounded by a late red card for Argentina international Angel Di Maria, who was given his marching orders after manhandling referee Michael Oliver. Di Maria was initially booked for simulation and took his protests too far by grabbing the official, which led to his instant dismissal. With 10 men, United was never able to exert any real pressure on Arsenal and it took two fine saves David De Gea to deny further goals from Santi Cazorla and Alexis Sanchez for the away side. Victory for Arsenal booked a return to Wembley for a last four clash with either Reading or Bradford City, who are replaying their quarterfinal tie next Monday. Liverpool or Blackburn Rovers will play Aston Villa in the other semifinal. Arsenal had taken a 25th minute lead through Nacho Monreal, the Spanish defender converting after fine move which involved Mesut Ozil and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. But the advantage was short lived with Di Maria finding Wayne Rooney to score with a diving header. United looked to press ahead for the winner, but home hopes were dashed when Valencia made a hash of a back pass and Welbeck was quick to latch on to the loose ball and beat De Gea. 'I believe it was justice for him to score he worked extremely hard today,' Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said of Welbeck. His counterpart van Gaal will now, barring a miracle, be left without a trophy in his first season in charge of the English powerhouses, with the pressure now on to seal a top four place in the EPL to guarantee Champions League football next season.","highlights":"Arsenal beats Man Utd 2-1 in FA Cup quarterfinal .\nFormer Manchester United player Danny Welbeck scores winner .\nHolders Arsenal took the lead through Nacho Monreal before Wayne Rooney equalized .\nAngel Di Maria sent off for shoving referee in second half ."}

The 28-minute message, which cannot be independently authenticated by CNN, was posted online by ISIS supporters. The message says that the caliphate, or Islamic State, has expanded to western Africa and congratulated \"our jihadi brothers\" there. The spokesman, Abu Mohammed al Adnani, encourages people to join fighters in Africa if they cannot make it to Iraq or Syria. Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau, announced in an audio message last week that the Islamist terror group was going to ally with ISIS. Jacob Zenn, a terror expert who lives in Nigeria, told CNN on Saturday the alliance would make sense for both groups. \"Boko Haram will get legitimacy, which will help its recruiting, funding and logistics as it expands,\" Zenn said. \"It will also get guidance from ISIS in media warfare and propaganda. Previously Boko Haram was a sort of outcast in the global Jihadi community. Now it is perhaps ISIS's biggest affiliate. \"ISIS gets more international legitimacy as a global caliphate.\" Boko Haram, whose name translates as \"Western education is sin,\" has been waging a yearslong campaign of terror aimed at instituting its extreme version of Sharia law. Boko Haram's tactics have intensified in recent years, from battling Nigerian government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages, mass kidnappings, assassinations, market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques.

{"article":"(CNN)Back in 2010 Britain's politicians broke new ground. They were long used to haranguing each other in the UK's rowdy House of Commons -- but they'd never had American style pre-election head-to-head debates. It is necessary and long-established political fare in the U.S. -- but over here in the UK, it was novel. It seemed to go well -- political points were scored, and polls were commissioned looking for advantages gained or lost. It was a drama of sorts, even though no knock-out punches were landed. Prime Minister David Cameron and his Conservative party won the election, but not by enough to go into government alone. For the past five years he's been governing in coalition with the UK's third party, the Liberal Democrats. And their leader, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, has mostly backed Cameron in Parliamentary debates against the opposition Labour leader Ed Miliband. Britain's broadcasters, keen to channel lively politics onto prime time TV and boost ratings, have been working the corridors of power themselves over the past year to try to nail down a repeat -- or two -- of the 2010 knockabout. What's at stake isn't just the proposed debates ahead of May's general election -- but the enshrining of such debates permanently into Britain's political architecture -- just like in the U.S. But while Cameron and Miliband have hired former White House election advisers to edge them in to the lead, no one can agree on what form a debate should take, how many there should be, or even who should be invited. Cameron has insisted on just one debate involving the leaders of seven leading UK parties -- giving equal airtime to the Greens, the Scottish Nationalists and the upstart rightwing UK Independence Party (UKIP), among others. But Miliband's Labour party is holding out for at least one head-to-head debate with Cameron. No one seems to be budging but both of the UK's largest parties could use the bump in the polls such a debate might bring. Part of the problem is the British electorate, which has changed since 2010, boosting the fortunes of some of the country's former political outliers. The rightwing UKIP, which has pledged to take the UK out of the European Union, has made massive gains in the past year -- mostly at the expense of Cameron's Conservatives. In Scotland, the September independence referendum (which narrowly failed) so reinvigorated the Scottish National Party that they could hit what is usually a key Labour stronghold, undermining Miliband's bid for power. All of this has made the whole process of nailing down precisely who will be allowed in the debate that much more tortuous. For the big leaders who drive that conversation, it is about how each outlier can help them -- and hinder their rivals. It once looked like it would become as much of a British institution as rain, or fish and chips, but now the election debate seems in danger of not happening at all. On the upside, you can still tune in to House of Commons TV most days of the week to get your fix of one lawmaker bellowing at another. But do it soon -- I hear that even those everyday raucous exchanges are being scrutinized for being a bit old-fashioned.","highlights":"Election TV debates only arrived in the UK in 2010 .\nBroadcasters are keen to repeat the head-to-head format in the run-up to the 2015 poll .\nBut factional politics and arguments about who is invited may derail a TV debate ."}

{"article":"Scotland lock Rob Harley insists the Dark Blues can finish their RBS 6 Nations off on a high if they can stretch their 20-minute blitz against England to an 80-minute onslaught. Vern Cotter's men host Ireland on Saturday knowing defeat will leave them with a disastrous whitewash for the third time in 11 years. But Glasgow forward Harley is taking hope from the promising spell at the end of the first half last weekend where his side stormed back from Jonathan Joseph's early score to grab a 13-10 half-time lead. Rob Harley believes Scotland can take hope from their 20-minute dominant spell over England on Saturday . Mark Bennett finished off a superb move before a pair of penalties from skipper Greig Laidlaw nudged them in front at the break. But Scotland failed to add a single point after the interval and slumped to a 25-13 defeat in London as England stepped up a level. Now Harley insists the Scots will only be able to dent Ireland's title push next weekend if they can repeat their brief moment of dominance down south for the full match at Murrayfield. He said: 'It was a very, very fast Test match on Saturday - possibly the quickest I've ever played. England came at us with huge pace and they moved the ball really well. Scotland\u00a0stormed back from Jonathan Joseph's early score to grab a 13-10 half-time lead at Twickenham .

{"article":"(CNN)Six weeks into the murder trial of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez, jurors in Fall River, Massachusetts, are getting more pieces of a time line leading up to the 2013 shooting death of Odin Lloyd, a semi-pro football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fianc\u00e9e. Taking center stage this week -- videotape never before seen in public, taken from Hernandez's own home security system. Prosecutors are using that grainy footage to suggest Hernandez is holding a .45-caliber handgun -- the same kind police say was used to kill Lloyd. Hernandez is seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after Lloyd was shot to death in an industrial park about a mile from Hernandez' Boston home. \"In my opinion, the firearm shown in the video stills is a Glock pistol,\" Glock sales manager Kyle Aspinwall testifies. Hernandez, Ernest Wallace, and Carlos Ortiz are seen on the same security video, recorded at about 3:30 a.m. on June 17, 2013, after the men walk into Hernandez's home. All three have been charged with murder in the death of Lloyd and have pleaded not guilty. Wallace and Ortiz are being tried separately. The video is time-stamped minutes after workers in a nearby industrial park describe hearing loud noises like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say Lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car driven by Hernandez. Jurors lean forward in their chairs, peering into monitors and scribbling notes as Aspinwall, a former Massachusetts state trooper and New Hampshire police chief, takes them frame by frame through video during two days of testimony. Aspinwall tells jurors Hernandez appears to be holding the pistol by its muzzle as he's standing at his basement door. The defense will have none of it. They attack Aspinwall's credentials. Aspinwall is well-schooled in Glocks but admits he doesn't consider himself a gun identification expert. Hernandez's lawyers then show a different part of the video time-stamped a few seconds earlier with Hernandez holding what appears to be a shiny object in one hand, suggesting it may be an iPad. \"Glock pistols don't have white glows to them, do they?\" defense attorney James Sultan asks. \"No, they do not,\" Aspinwall answers. Sultan then displays a soft-pellet gun similar in shape to a Glock, suggesting it could also be the object Hernandez is holding. Prosecutors dispute the suggestion. \"Are you aware of anybody going pellet gun shooting at 3:30 in the morning?\" Bristol County Assistant District Attorney Patrick Bomberg asks Aspinwall. University of New Hampshire law professor Michael McCann calls the Glock expert's findings powerful; yet, he thinks the defense did a solid job of raising questions about the fuzzy video. \"The jury might think that the defense is just throwing things against the wall,\" he says. \"But on the other hand, the jury may feel like it could be one of a dozen things. That's reasonable doubt.\" One thing not in dispute: the alleged murder weapon remains missing. So does a solid motive. Prosecutors could be laying the groundwork for showing more surveillance video of Hernandez -- who at the time was a star receiver for the New England Patriots -- partying with Lloyd and Hernandez's personal barber at Rumor nightclub two nights before Lloyd's death. Investigators say Hernandez was angry that Lloyd was talking to some people that night. Hernandez and Lloyd are not seen together on a camera pointed at the club's bar, and they appear to be separated for a time when they leave, but so far there's no testimony about what may have gone wrong. What might Hernandez's fianc\u00e9e say? Akil Joseph, a longtime friend of Lloyd's who takes the stand, tells jurors he talked with Lloyd at the club and says he appeared \"normal.\" When Azil Joseph leaves the stand, he keeps his eyes locked on Hernandez until he walks past the defense table. Cameras show Hernandez leaving the bar, but they do not show the moment when a parking valet testified he saw what he believed to be a gun in Hernandez's waistband. The valet's hotel security boss tells jurors he didn't see a weapon under the football player's shirt. Near the club, Hernandez is in his SUV with Lloyd and another friend. Hernandez offers a ride to Jennifer Fortier, his babysitter, who happened to be nearby with a friend. Fortier tells jurors Hernandez and Lloyd were smoking pot. Despite her objections, Hernandez drives her and the friend to Hernandez's so-called \"flophouse\" about 20 minutes from Gillette Stadium, the Patriots' home field in Foxborough. Fortier testifies that Hernandez \"tried kissing me.\" \"I told him 'No, I'm your nanny. I can't do this,'\" she adds. \"He said he understood ... and he wasn't mad at me.\"","highlights":"Aaron Hernandez on trial for death of Odin Lloyd .\nTestimony focused on security video from Hernandez's home .\nDebate over whether Hernandez holding gun or electronic device ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Everywhere you look there are two-wheeled drivers waiting ominously for passengers to hop on board. They're the backbone of public transport in Uganda and the fastest way to get around the capital city, Kampala. The boda boda motorbike taxi is a staple used by all sectors of society. Traditionally, the usual way of catching a ride was to venture into any street corner packed with tens of boda bodas or simply waiting for one to pass by. But now, a new local startup are bringing this classic mode of transport into the technological age by providing the ability to hail a boda boda at the click of a smartphone. \"Bodas are the main thing getting people from A to B,\" says Alastair Sussock, co-founder of SafeBoda, \"and we're trying to professionalize this transportation in the city.\" The motorbike taxis have their greatest popularity globally in Uganda, with over 80,000 riding the streets of Kampala, according to Sussex who wants to seize upon the country's burgeoning young population. Uganda has more than 24% of the population aged between 10 and 19 years old, according to UNICEF -- and Sussock wants them to get on their bikes. \"Young people use smartphones in Kampala and it's one of the youngest countries in the world,\" he says. For now, the Uber-like startup operates mainly in the northern districts of Kampala, where a click on the SafeBoda app -- in addition to the traditional method of hailing them on the street -- will bring you a Safeboda bike, complete with a uniformed driver in a bright orange jacket, helmet and fully trained in road safety. He'll even have a helmet for you. Safety has long been a concern for those riding boda bodas as the bikes are a leading cause of death and head injury in Kampala. A study conducted at Mulago National Referral  Hospital in Kampala, by researchers at Makerere University, identified approximately 40% of trauma cases at the hospital to be due to boda-boda accidents. I request a SafeBoda to take me to meet the team in the upmarket area of Kisementi, in Kampala's central district. As i stand waiting, at least 10 regular boda bodas pass by beeping to get my attention and business. A driver called Richard Lalunga then arrives who I spot clearly in the distance thanks to his bright orange jacket and orange helmets -- one on his head and one on his handlebars. Lalunga has been a boda driver for four years and joined SafeBoda four months ago to learn more about road safety. He explains how he now earns more than ever before due to a loyal customer base stemming from his safe driving. The ride was in fact calmer than those taken with other bodas, and unlike some, as we ride along the congested streets no kerbs were scaled or mounted to avoid the traffic. The name stands - safeboda. The dangers lie in the low use of helmets -- by both drivers and users -- alongside risky driving and poor road safety practices. This makes many fearful of catching a two-wheeled ride but the team at SafeBoda are trying to lure people back on board. They're reinventing the boda boda reputation to prove they can be safe, as well as fast and economical. \"It's a market-based approach to road safety,\" says Sussock, an economist, who believes that as word spreads about the skills of his drivers, the income -- and safety -- of his drivers will rise and reflect this. \"People in Uganda don't wear helmets,\" says Sussock. \"So how do we get them to wear helmets?\" The answer, is by providing one. Driver training is provided in partnership with the Ugandan Red Cross and takes place for up to three weeks to cover road safety and bike maintenance -- and it seems to be working. Since its inception in November 2014, the fleet of drivers at SafeBoda has reached 50, currently occupying four areas towards the north and center of the city. The main need for safe driving is in the congested streets of downtown Kampala where the company plans to expand into next. \"If we train people and make them good and responsible drivers, we're going to save lives,\" says Ricky Rapa Thomson, who manages the drivers. \"But implementing has been a challenge,\" he says about the difficulties in changing the mindsets of a population. The team are dreaming big, with plans to expand to 100 by the end of March and 800 by the end of 2015. \"With over 1,000 drivers we can begin to change the entire boda industry,\" says Sussock.

Button and team-mate Kevin Magnussen - standing in for the absent Fernando Alonso - will start Sunday's Australian Grand Prix from the back row of the grid in 17th and 18th positions respectively. Whilst not McLaren's lowest grid slots, in terms of performance and how far they are off the pace compared with the leading cars, it is the team's worst qualifying performance in their 49-year history. Jenson Button is pictured with his model wife Jessica ahead of Saturday's qualifying session . The Briton endured a miserable day at the office and was eliminated from qualifying in Q1 . Button was the best part of six seconds slower than reigning champion Lewis Hamilton, who went on to clinch the 39th pole position of his Formula One career. Button, who signed a new two-year deal with McLaren in December after he was kept waiting months on a decision as to whether he would be retained, has every faith McLaren and new power-unit supplier Honda will get it right. The 35-year-old, however, has warned it will take time as he said: 'When I re-signed I was thinking long term. We're all thinking long term. 'It's unfair for us to sit here now and be harsh on anyone because this is a massive learning curve for us.

'I know we're a long way off right now, but it was always going to be very difficult. 'It's tough times and it's going to be for many weeks, but that is what is going to make us stronger in the future and hopefully build us into a winning team. 'Just don't expect us to gain two seconds at the next race, and then another two seconds. It's not going to be like that, but you will see progress.' Racing director Eric Boullier has confirmed McLaren and Honda know where the issues lie, and are working as fast as possible to rectify them. 'Actually we have fewer issues this weekend than we had in testing, which is the good news, we have made some progress,' said Boullier. 'Yes, there is a fix in place and we are working on a recovery plan, but as to time we don't know. 'We just want to do our best to recover as quickly as possible.'

{"article":"(CNN)The tragic news that Germanwings Flight 9525 was deliberately crashed into the French Alps by a pilot deemed \"100% fit to fly\" challenges the common understanding of the phrase. Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said co-pilot Andreas Lubitz apparently \"wanted to destroy the aircraft,\" taking advantage of the pilot leaving the cockpit and most likely refusing to open the cabin door after activating the plane's descent. The CEO of Lufthansa -- of which Germanwings is a subsidiary -- said Lubitz had been \"fit to fly.\" But for most of us, the prosecutor's preliminary finding that the 28-year-old German purposefully caused the deaths of 150 people on March 24 puts him squarely outside that term. In fact \"fit to fly\" does not mean the pilot's psychological state has necessarily been assessed. Simon Mitchell is a pilot and visiting fellow at Cranfield University's Safety and Accident Investigation Centre in southern England. Over the last few years the aviation industry has been considering the amount of time spent examining pilots' skills compared to the time spent examining how they thought, Mitchell said. Many organizations had begun assessing the safety of particular airlines when considering which carriers their members should fly on, he said. \"It's not uncommon for those corporations to have in their assessment matrix a look at pilot selection procedures,\" Mitchell said. \"Increasingly we're looking at their all-round personalities and ability to work in teams and what they're like as people. \"Apart from 'do we want to ensure we haven't recruited somebody who might have some sort of mental disorder,' there's also a very good reason in a day-to-day way. You want to recruit somebody who works well in a team,\" he said. \"The airline industry is quite unique in the amount of trust and liability it places in the hands of a very small number of employees,\" Mitchell said. \"If you look at the value of the aircraft and the immeasurable value of the lives being flown in that aircraft, you come up to a huge number -- in the hundreds of millions, if not billions -- of dollars of risk associated with that asset. In effect, a medium to large sized company is being placed in the hands of a few employees. \"It is important that these airlines take a great deal of care -- not just about whether that pilot can fly -- but how fit that person is to carry that sort of responsibility.\" On Thursday, Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said the company's pilots did not undergo regular or routine psychological testing once they were flying. But he said Lufthansa did consider an applicant's psychological state, along with other factors, when hiring pilots. \"We don't only look at competence, but we also give a lot of room to psychological capabilities,\" Spohr said. The pilot and co-pilot on Germanwings Flight 9525 had passed the test the airline used to evaluate applicants, he said. But Mitchell said aviation regulations only required a physical  and not a psychiatric medical examination, looking at a potential pilot's fitness to fly in terms of factors such as heart attack risk. Those being examined were legally required to declare any mental disorder, but there was no standard psych testing from a regulatory point of view, he said, with airlines and industry bodies failing to reach consensus on types of tests to be used. \"The doctor is supposed to note any evident issues that he notices -- but what is he going to notice in half an hour's medical? The rest of it relies on your medical history and you being honest,\" Mitchell said. The Federal Aviation Administration told CNN that U.S. scheduled airline pilots must renew medical certificates every year if they're less than 40 years old and every six months if older. \"Pilots must complete an official FAA medical application form, and have a physical examination conducted by an FAA-designated Aviation Medical Examiner,\" it said. \"The FAA medical application form includes questions pertaining to the mental health of the pilot. The AME can defer a pilot to the FAA Office of Aerospace Medicine if he or she believes that additional psychological testing is indicated. All existing physical and psychological conditions and medications must be disclosed.\" On its website, the FAA guidance for AMEs states: \"The FAA does not expect the Examiner to perform a formal psychiatric examination. However, the Examiner should form a general impression of the emotional stability and mental state of the applicant.\" In terms of a pilot's fitness to fly on a particular day, Mitchell said attempts by many companies and airlines to introduce random drug and alcohol testing had hit problems with unions. \"When crew report for duty, they obviously are seen by other company personnel and they're also supposed to stop someone who's not fit for duty,\" he said, adding that was not a particularly robust system. \"It does rely on a professional crew member turning around and stopping the flight.\" In the short term, the industry needed to be sensitive to the fact that the crash was \"an incredibly tragic event,\" Mitchell said. \"We need to be conscious in short-term not to exacerbate stress of the families in the first days,\" he said. \"It is important as an industry to recognize the amount of trust that's been put in our hands and ensure the system is robust enough to live up to that.\" But managing an industry with global implications was complex, Mitchell said, pointing out that Lubitz was able to lock out the other pilot because of strengthened security measures introduced after the September 11 hijackings. \"It's horribly, tragically, ironic that an unintended consequence of trying to mitigate one risk has actually facilitated an equally horrendous act -- that wouldn't have been possible if we hadn't done something to try to mitigate the other risk.\" Was 9\/11 safety precaution a flaw?

{"article":"(CNN)With its snow-capped mountains and picturesque deserted hamlets, the Bleone Valley, where a Germanwings jet crashed Tuesday, is a stunningly beautiful but sparsely populated spot. Tiny villages are scattered along the gorge, which rises from the apple and pear orchards and the gray stone riverbed of the valley floor to heights of more than 2,000 meters (1.2 miles) above sea level. Many of these villages, which were bustling communities in the 19th century, now lie abandoned or survive with just a handful of inhabitants. One dead-end road, the D107, winds its way through Prads-Haute-Bleone, passing churches and a campsite that offers a peaceful retreat for summer hikers. But the remoteness -- which appeals to small numbers of holidaymakers looking to ski in winter or take restorative walks through the green hills in the warmer months -- may make reaching the wreckage of the Germanwings plane difficult. Gilles Gravier, director of the tourist office in Val d'Allos, told French newspaper Liberation the crash occurred in a particularly steep spot on the Trois Eveches mountain, and may have been witnessed by skiers on the area's slopes. \"There is no access by road; emergency crews are coming in by air, using helicopters,\" he said. Capt. Benoit Zeisser from the Gendarmerie in the nearby town of Digne told CNN the aircraft was lying in \"difficult terrain.\" Sandrine Boisse, the president of the tourism office at the Pra Loup ski resort, said she heard the plane crash and called the police and the local government office to find out what had happened. \"It was about 11 (a.m.) here. I was outside the garage, and we heard a strange noise, \" she said. \"And at first we thought it was an avalanche, but it was strange at this time because it was 11. \"Something was wrong. ... We didn't know what.\" Her husband was skiing nearby and saw a plane flying at low altitude, she said. French President Francois Hollande warned \"it will take some hours for the emergency services to reach the crash site.\" Photographs posted on Twitter hours after the plane disappeared from radar showed helicopters preparing to take off, and emergency vehicles lining up ready to receive the victims' remains. The bodies of those on board the plane are expected to be taken to the gymnasium at the local high school in Seyne les Alpes, some 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the crash site, which will be used as a temporary morgue. French police in the region have pleaded with locals and visitors to stay away from the site, urging them \"not to clutter the roads,\" leaving them clear for emergency vehicles.","highlights":"Resident tells CNN she initially mistook the noise from the crash for an avalanche .\nCrash site in the Bleone Valley is remote, difficult to reach .\nSingle mountain road leads to area; police urge people to leave it clear ."}
{"article":"(CNN)The terrorists who attacked the Bardo Museum in Tunis, Tunisia, last week were wearing suicide vests but failed to detonate them before being gunned down by police, Tunisia's President told CNN. \"They had them, but they didn't work, because the police turned up and they were shot down and they didn't have the time to get these vests to work. Because had they done so, we would have had major catastrophe,\" President Beji Caid Essebsi told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. A third museum attacker remains at large, Essebsi said. Previously two suspects had been identified -- Yassine Labidi and Saber Khachnaou -- though it wasn't immediately clear if they were the pair killed at the museum by Tunisian security forces. Essebsi told Amanpour 15 arrests had been made since Wednesday's attack, in which 23 people were killed. Most of the victims were foreigners and 19 were tourists who'd been on two cruise ships that docked in Tunis. Essebsi said he believed the attackers were members of ISIS who had been trained in Libya. This echoed comments made by Tunisia's Security Minister Rafik Chelly on Friday, who said two attackers had been given weapons training at Libyan camps and had been activated from sleeper cells. In an audio message posted online Thursday, ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. The message said the group had targeted \"crusaders and apostates\" with \"automatic weapons and hand grenades\" in bloodshed that was \"just the start.\"  CNN cannot independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement. An uncle of suspect Yassine Labidi, Abeld Malik Labidi, told CNN on Friday that no one he knew had seen any signs of extremism in his 26-year-old nephew. He said Yassine Labidi was one of the two gunmen killed at the museum. \"It's true that Yassine carried out this terrorist attack, he was killed; his head, his body, we don't have it back,\" he said. But, he said, he believed Yassine and other young Tunisians like him were also victims of terrorism -- of the recruiters who paid them money, organized the logistics and took them to places like Syria and Libya to train as fighters. Laura Smith-Spark and Claudia Morales contributed to this report.","highlights":"The Bardo Museum attackers wore suicide vests, Tunisia's President tells CNN .\nPolice shot them before they could detonate the vests, Beji Caid Essebsi says .\nEssebsi says 15 people have been arrested over the deadly attack ."}

{"article":"(CNN)The family of Michael Brown, the teen killed last year by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, will file a civil wrongful death lawsuit in the case \"very shortly,\" attorney Anthony Gray said Thursday. Neither he nor attorney Daryl Parks would say exactly when the suit would be filed, but they said that they disagreed with the grand jury's and the Justice Department's decisions not to charge Wilson in the shooting. \"They have accepted (Wilson's) self-defense,\" Parks told reporters. \"We do not accept his self-defense.\" The slain teen's parents, Michael Brown Sr. and Lesley McSpadden, were in attendance at the news conference but did not speak on advice of their attorneys, Parks said. \"The last 24 hours have been tough for them,\" he said. Word of the lawsuit comes a day after the Justice Department determined there was not sufficient evidence to charge Wilson in Brown's death but found in a separate investigation that the Ferguson Police Department showed a pattern of racial bias. Brown Sr. and McSpadden released a statement Wednesday saying they were disappointed that Wilson would not face charges, but, they added, the federal report on the police department could provide a silver lining. \"We are encouraged that the DOJ will hold the Ferguson Police Department accountable for the pattern of racial bias and profiling they found in their handling of interactions with people of color,\" the statement said. \"It is our hope that through this action, true change will come not only in Ferguson, but around the country. If that change happens, our son's death will not have been in vain.\" In November, a grand jury cleared Wilson and, in an uncharacteristic move in grand jury proceedings, the prosecutor released all the evidence that was considered. Gray said the civil lawsuit will rely on \"pretty much the same evidence,\" but it will be cast differently. The jury in the civil lawsuit will be asked to make a determination based on a lower burden of proof -- by a preponderance of evidence, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt, Parks said. Summing up the crux of the Brown family's case, Parks said, \"There were other alternatives available to (Wilson). He did not have to kill Michael Brown.\"","highlights":"Attorney says jury in civil lawsuit will make decision based on lower burden of proof .\nWord of the lawsuit comes a day after Justice Department declines to charge Darren Wilson ."}

{"article":"(CNN)\"Breast is best\" -- you could call it a mantra of sorts that sums up much of today's research on breastfeeding. Not only does breastfeeding have clear short-term benefits, such as protection from infectious diseases and a reduction in mortality, it's also been shown to be associated with an increase in intelligence. Prior studies have shown an increase of up to 7.5 IQ points in elementary age children who were breastfed, as well as an increase in verbal, performance and comprehensive IQ in adults. The latest addition to this perspective is a long-term study of infants born in Pelotas, Brazil, in 1982. Published in Lancet, the study interviewed 5,914 new mothers about their plans for breastfeeding and then followed up to see how they did. \"Information on breastfeeding duration was collected very close to the time when weaning happened, so we had a very precise information on the duration of breastfeeding,\" said study author, Dr. Bernardo Lessa Horta, in a podcast on Lancet. What makes this study unique is that it followed the subjects all the way to age 30. \"We were able to follow about 68% of the participants, which is a very good follow-up rate,\" said Lessa Horta. \"We observed that breastfeeding was positively associated with performance and intelligence at 30 years old, as well as with education, school achievement and higher monthly incomes.\" In fact, Lessa Horta said the subjects who had been breastfed for 12 months or longer had a higher IQ (about 3.7 points), more years of education and earned roughly 20% more than the average income level. \"It's suggesting that the positive effect of breastfeeding on IQ leads to a higher income,\" he said. \"This is our main finding at this moment.\" One possible reason for the advantage of breast milk, Lessa Horta added, is that it is \"rich in long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids which are important to brain growth and development.\" Called LCPUFA for short, these essential fatty acids are found in salmon and shellfish and have been added to infant formulas since the 1990s. However, the benefit to mental or psychomotor development from adding LCPUFA to infant formula is unclear. Because the study did not measure home life, intellectual stimulation or bonding between mother and child, it was not able to tease out whether these factors may have also contributed to the increase in IQ.  That leaves it open to critics, such as Texas A&M Professor Joan Wolf, author of  \"Is Breast Best? \"This study does not address the very real possibility that mothers who choose to breastfeed, regardless of income or education, distinguish themselves from those who bottle-feed in all kinds of ways that are likely to promote intelligence,\" Wolf wrote CNN. For Lessa Horta, the implications of his study are clear: \"The finding supports the promotion of breastfeeding. It's more evidence that besides the clear short term benefits, breastfeeding also has long term consequences in terms of human potential.\"","highlights":"Long-term study finds that IQ at age 30 was nearly 4 points higher for babies breastfed for a year or more .\nStudy conducted in Brazil also associates longer breastfeeding with higher income and education levels .\nCritic points out that the study doesn't account for other possible contributing factors ."}
{"article":"(CNN)After a handful events in two months, Hillary Clinton has filled her March with a mix of women's events, nonprofit speeches and at least one paid appearance. In January and February, Clinton headlined three events -- only one of which was in the United States. But as Clinton moves closer to her expected 2016 presidential campaign announcement, the former secretary or state has at least seven events scheduled for the month of March. Most of Clinton's events are focused on one thing: women. Clinton starts her month by headlining the 30th anniversary gala for Emily's List -- a pro-Clinton organization that focused on helping Democratic women win elected office. At the D.C. speech on March 3, Clinton is expected to give a nod to the group's importance to Democrats and highlight the reason more women are needed in politics. Emily's List has been energized by Clinton's campaign and has pledged to raise and spend more money than any other election cycle because of the prospect of a Clinton White House. The following week, Clinton will headline two New York events tied to her 1995 speech to the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing -- a speech Clinton regularly references in pitches to women. In that speech Clinton said, \"If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all.\" On March 9, Clinton teams up with Chelsea, her daughter, and Melinda Gates to release a report through the Clinton Foundation that looks at \"the gaps that still remain\" in women's participation in the economy and politics. The following day -- on March 10 -- Clinton will headline the United Nation's Women Empowerment Principles annual gathering in New York. Clinton will use the speech to outline the findings in the Clinton Foundation report and \"reflect on progress made in implementing the agenda set in Beijing two decades ago,\" the organizers said in a release about the event. On March 16, Clinton will be inducted into the Irish America Hall of Fame at an event in New York. Clinton is not Irish -- her family is of English, Scottish, French, and Welsh descent -- but she is being honored because of \"her dedicated work on Irish Peace Process.\" \"Hillary Rodham Clinton is one of the unsung heroes of the success of the Irish peace process,\" said Irish America co-founder Niall O'Dowd. In 1998, Clinton put together the Vital Voices Conference of women in Belfast, a body that pressed for a piece agreement. The former secretary of state cited her experiences in Ireland during a number of speeches in 2014. O'Dowd is a longtime Clinton supporter, though,and was a member of her 2008 campaign finance team. Some Republicans have questioned how active Clinton was in the Northern Ireland peace process. The Washington Post Fact Checker wrote in 2008 that Clinton \"seems to be overstating her significance as a catalyst in the Northern Ireland peace process, which was more symbolic than substantive,\" but that she did play \"a helpful role at the margins.\" On March 19, Clinton will headline her only confirmed paid speech of the month when she heads to Atlantic City for the American Camp Association, NY & NJ Conference. Susie Lupert, the group's executive director, tells CNN, \"Yes, just like most nonprofits and conferences, she is being paid for her appearance.\" But she would not confirm how much she is being paid. On average, Clinton makes between $200,000 and $300,000 per speech. Near the end of the month, on March 23 in Washington, D.C., Clinton will be the keynote speaker at the award celebration for the Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting from Syracuse University. Robin Toner, who graduated from Syracuse, was the first woman national political correspondent for the New York Times. Syracuse Dean Lorraine Branham said Clinton is a \"vivid example \u2014 like Robin \u2014 of a pioneering woman at the top of her profession.\" Clinton headlining an event honoring political journalists is somewhat unique because for decades she has held a dim view of the profession. In a 1996, according to the diary of the late Clinton confidant Diane Blair, Clinton said the media are \"complete hypocrites.\" At an event in 2014, Clinton said \"journalism has changed quite a bit in a way that is not good for the country and not good for journalism.\" \"A lot of serious news reporting has become more entertainment driven and more opinion-driven as opposed to factual,\" she said. \"People book onto the shows, political figures, commentators who will be controversial who will be provocative because it's a good show. You might not learn anything but you might be entertained and I think that's just become an unfortunate pattern that I wish could be broken.\" Clinton's presidential campaign has become a forgone conclusion and Democrats close to Clinton expect she will announce some official move towards the presidency in April.","highlights":"Clinton currently has seven events in March, with one paid speech and many focused on women .\nThis comes after Clinton gave only three speeches in January and February .\nClinton is expected to announce some official move towards the presidency in April, according to Democrats close to her ."}

{"article":"(CNN)The Palestinian issue dominates international news coverage of Israel, with images of missiles, terror tunnels and failed peace negotiations frequently splashed across TV screens and newspapers. So you would think that security would be the central issue in Tuesday's Israeli elections, right? The short answer is no. Poll after poll in Israel has confirmed that the public views the high cost of living as the top issue for voters in this election. Indeed, even a majority of Israel's Arab citizens within the pre-1967 borders -- most of whom identify with the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza -- view socioeconomic issues as the priority for Tuesday's parliamentary poll, rather than advancing the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. What explains this apparent indifference? First, despite what the polls suggest, peace and security actually remain the most important underlying issue in Israeli politics. The main parties recognize that they need to cross the credibility threshold on this issue, and they therefore include former high-ranking army officers and diplomats among their ranks. Whatever they may say to pollsters, many voters continue to vote primarily on this issue. However, because most such voters are staunch supporters of the right or the left and have already made up their minds, they are unlikely to shift their vote between these two blocs, so their votes are not in play in these elections. This wasn't always the case -- a significant group of voters once swung back and forth between right and left. However, for some time now, the majority of Israelis have shared a consensual position on the Palestinian question. In principle, they continue to favor a two-state solution and they are prepared to make extensive compromises in exchange for genuine peace -- greater concessions than in the 1990s at the height of the peace process. However, in practice, that same majority believes that even if an Israeli government were to agree to more compromises than they view as acceptable, Israel would still not obtain the minimum required in terms of peace and security to make the deal worthwhile. Why? Experience has certainly taught middle Israel to be deeply skeptical of the possibility of peace with the Palestinians, irrespective of the complexion of the Israeli government. In 2000, for example, a Labor-led government agreed to a Palestinian state in all of Gaza, 97% of the West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem, including the holiest site in Judaism, the Temple Mount. Yet not only did Yasser Arafat reject the deal, but the Palestinians launched an unprecedented wave of suicide bombings against Israeli civilians. Add in the fact that subsequent unilateral Israeli withdrawals from south Lebanon and Gaza resulted in tens of thousands of rockets being launched at Israeli civilians, and the 2008 decision by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to reject Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's peace proposal -- a plan similar to the Clinton parameters that Arafat rejected in 2000 -- and Israeli wariness is easy to understand. Since then, leaks from the recent round of peace talks have only served to strengthen the Israeli public's skepticism -- the Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu was reportedly prepared to accept a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, only for Abbas to refuse to engage positively with a wide-ranging American peace outline including this element, according to Israel's Channel 2, even when he was presented with it directly by President Obama himself. As a result of all this, much of the electorate is determining its vote based on other issues, where voters hope political change in Israel can actually make a real difference to their lives. Indeed, the most likely candidate for kingmaker following the elections is Moshe Kahlon's centrist party Kulanu, whose agenda is to lower the cost of living in Israel. (Kahlon won fame in Israel by dramatically lowering the cost of cell phone use through the introduction of wide-ranging competition into the market.) In keeping with the mood of the public, the ex-Likudnik presents a moderate image on the Palestinian issue and has appeared to try to steer away from discussing issues of peace and security. In fact, one senior Israeli official told me that Kahlon's team has been advised against even mentioning the word \"peace\" for the rest of the campaign. That says it all.","highlights":"Israel holds parliamentary elections on Tuesday .\nJonathan Rynhold: Despite polls, peace and security key issue ."}

{"article":"(CNN)The death of the founding father of Singapore last Monday is an appropriate occasion to reflect on nation building. As prime minister for its first three decades, Lee Kuan Yew raised a poor port from the bottom rungs of the third world to the first world in a single generation. As it prepares to mark its 50th anniversary as a nation, Singapore is today an ultra-modern metropolis of almost six million people with higher per capita GDP than the United States, according to the World Bank. Lee's achievement in building a successful nation contrasts sharply with the results of Washington's expenditure of over $4 trillion and nearly 7,000 American lives in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past decade. Some say Singapore's story is sui generis: Something that could only happen in that time and place. But its remarkable performance has less to do with miraculous conditions than with Lee's model of disciplined, visionary leadership. Leaders of other aspiring-to-develop nations, and even the U.S., should take pages from Lee Kuan Yew's playbook to address current challenges. We know many of Lee's lessons on the role of government leadership in development because my co-authors and I asked him directly two years ago to reflect on them -- points we captured in our book, Lee Kuan Yew: The Grand Master's Insights on China, the United States, and the World. Five stand out. First, Lee insisted that governance was first and foremost about results. In his words, \"the acid test of any legal system is not the greatness or the grandeur of its ideal concepts, but whether, in fact, it is able to produce order and justice.\" About the core purposes of government, he was crystal clear. In terms America's founding fathers would recognize, he believed that \"the ultimate test of the value of a political system is whether it helps that society establish conditions which improve the standard of living for the majority of its people, plus enabling the maximum of personal freedoms compatible with the freedoms of others in society.\" Second, superior performance requires superior leadership. Lee demanded of leaders both intellectual and moral superiority. Contrary to modern Western democratic theory that emphasizes citizens' participation in governance, his views were closer to Plato's conception of the \"guardians,\" or China's historical Mandarins. Good government requires most of all leaders who put the public good unquestionably above their own personal interests. He was disappointed by many of his counterparts who failed that test. Third, successful societies guarantee strict equality of opportunity for all individuals, but are realistic about the fact that this will yield substantial inequalities in outcomes. For Lee, the essence of a successful society was intense competition on a level playing field that allows each individual to achieve his or her maximum. Few things offended him more than denial of equality of opportunity on the basis of caste (India), class (Europe), race (the U.S. during segregation), sex, or other irrelevant attributes. As he put it, the leader's objective was to \"build up a society in which people will be rewarded not according to the amount of property they own, but according to their active contribution to society in physical or mental labor.\" Fourth, about democracy, particularly Western liberal democracy, Lee had serious reservations. In part, this attitude stemmed from his own experience, but it also reflected a deeper philosophical aversion to ideologies. As he liked to say, \"the acid test is performance, not promises. The millions dispossessed in Asia care not and know not of theory. They want a better life. They want a more equal, just society.\" Lee enjoyed engaging American critics who insisted that without democracy Singapore could not develop an advanced economy. In contrast, he argued that what most countries needed was more \"discipline,\" rather than democracy. He noted that the U.S. had been building democracy and giving aid to the Philippines for over a century. But, he asked, how many people from Singapore sought to leave it for the Philippines? Many people in the Philippines, he noted, wanted to move to Singapore. On one occasion, with a broad smile, he continued, \"and you will notice that since the Vietnam War and the Great Society, the U.S. system has not functioned even for the United States.\" Fifth, which leaders did he most admire? From the recent past, he focused on three: Charles de Gaulle, Deng Xiaoping, and Winston Churchill. \"De Gaulle, because he had tremendous guts; Deng, because he changed China from a broken-backed state, which would have imploded like the Soviet Union, into what it is today; and \"Churchill, because any other person would have given up.\" On the current scene, the leader who impressed him most was the new president of China, Xi Jinping. As he said just before Xi took office: \"I would put him in Nelson Mandela's class of persons. A person with enormous emotional stability who does not allow his personal misfortunes or sufferings to affect his judgment. In a word, he is impressive.\" As China's leaders attempt to follow in Lee's footsteps in building a Mandarin-Leninist led nation that overtook the U.S. last year in GDP (measured by PPP) to become the world's largest economy, and democratic India seems poised to grow at rates that will compete with China, we can reflect on lessons from Lee Kuan Yew and place our bets. Governing a nation in which two of every three citizens believe their country is headed in the wrong direction -- and have believed so under Democratic and Republican Presidents for all of the 21st century -- American leaders should ask whether it is time to focus on the acid test of performance rather than the litmus test of ideology.","highlights":"In Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew had remarkable success in creating a prosperous modern state .\nHis lessons should prove instructive to other leaders in a time of great instability, writes Graham Allison .\nLee passed on his insights on the role of government leadership in development to Allison ."}

{"article":"(CNN)The desert and dun-colored cliffs around the town of Tataouine were once the backdrop for the movie \"Star Wars,\" much of which was filmed in this neglected corner of Tunisia in 1976. This struggling town on the fringes of the Sahara still draws a few fans of the movie but now finds itself part of a real conflict, as a way-station for jihadists crossing the Libyan border 60 miles to the east. Earlier this month, before the gun attack on the Bardo Museum in Tunis, three young men were arrested here as they allegedly made plans to cross into Libya to join a terrorist network. A local official told CNN they had since been taken to Tunis for questioning. Two arms caches have also been found in the region this month, one of which included rocket-propelled grenade launchers and more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition, thought to have been removed from a Libyan armory in the aftermath of Moammar Gadhafi's ouster in 2011. Driving near the border, it's quickly obvious why the Tunisian government is so anxious about Libya's implosion and the emergence there of an ISIS affiliate whose tentacles stretch half-way across the country. This open space is vast and sparsely populated. Smugglers' tracks criss-cross the endless scrub and steep, arid hills that run along the border. Gasoline, drugs and other contraband have long been smuggled across the frontier. Near the town of Remada, south of Tataouine, a couple of soldiers manned a checkpoint. They wore protective jackets -- whether for show or because of the perceived threat from Islamist militants, it's hard to know. When we arrived, passports were requested and phone calls made. We were escorted into the town and politely but firmly told we could go no further without written authorization. Exactly four years ago we had passed through Remada unchallenged. Tunisians had just launched the Arab Spring. There was a mood of heady optimism and the security apparatus of the Ben Ali regime had melted away. But already Libya was falling apart, as different groups of rebels fought to oust Gadhafi. Thousands of foreign workers were then trying to escape the violence through the few official border crossings. Now Libya's descent into chaos means those crossings are sometimes closed, and it's foreign fighters using the smugglers' trails that Tunisia must worry about. At the national guard building in Remada the officer in charge -- a burly figure in his mid-40s - was wearing a \"New York 1999\" sweatshirt and appeared to be one of many plainclothes security personnel in the town. He was happy to talk but didn't want his name reported. Ignoring calls on his cell phone, he lamented the state of the Arab world and the expansion of Daesh, as ISIS is frequently called. Look at Iraq, Syria, Libya....of course Tunisia is threatened, he said. The Tunisians are doing what they can, he said. There is now a 1.8-mile no-go zone inside the border, and the military has built fortified positions every couple of miles. The security presence has been boosted seven- to ten-fold, but even so there weren't enough men or equipment. The border, after all, is 380 miles long. A much wider buffer zone -- 12 miles deep -- has also been created, which people can only enter with permission. This has not gone down well with local herders whose goats and sheep live off the desert scrub. Other measures taken by the Tunisian authorities, according to the official in Remada, include a ban on men aged 18-35 from going to Libya unless they have residence papers and proof of employment there. Another source said the ban applied to men under 30. Even so the two gunmen who stormed into the Bardo Museum last week -- both of them in their twenties -- had been able to cross illicitly into Libya in December, according to Tunisian State Security Minister Rafik Chelly. Chelly told a Tunisian network that the pair had received weapons training in the ISIS stronghold of Derna. The mood among many Tunisians seems much harder and more pragmatic than it was four years ago. A shopkeeper in a small village between Tataouine and Remada said there needs to be a security crackdown. He said people in the area led simple lives -- but they knew each other and noticed strangers. Bassim, a taxi driver on the island of Djerba, some 60 miles to the north of Tataouine, was of a similar view. \"The people need to be the third eye of the security forces\" he said. \"And we need to think of the safety of visitors like we think of the safety of our families.\" Bassim and hundreds of thousands of other Tunisians have reason to be worried. They rely on tourism to make a living, and fear that ISIS will -- as it has threatened -- launch further attacks against foreigners visiting Libya. Bassim ferries tourists around Djerba, whose luxury hotels and beaches are a popular destination for French and German tourists. It took the tourist industry years to recover from a terror attack on a synagogue on the island in 2002 in which 21 people were killed. Bassim says he's heard all too many horror stories about events in Libya from the oil workers he took to Djerba's airport. Others, mainly in the capital Tunis, are apprehensive that the democratic gains of four years ago may be eroded or lost in a new security clampdown. They point to new anti-terrorism legislation that strengthens detention powers and the right of the authorities to monitor suspects' phones and social media. The measure was being discussed in parliament Wednesday when the attack was launched on the adjacent museum. Tunisians say their country is at a crossroads as it tries to fend off the jihadist contagion seeping across North Africa. Their democracy is young and vulnerable. \"We want to be the hope of the Arab world,\" said Bassim, \"like we were four years ago.\" \"We still have hope, but now we have fear too.\"","highlights":"Tataouine, near \"Star Wars\" set, lies just 60 miles from the Libyan border .\nTunisian officials worry about the area because of its proximity to Libya, and ISIS ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Denmark has slammed as \"unacceptable\" comments by Russia's envoy to Denmark that joining NATO's missile defense shield would make Danish warships \"targets for Russian nuclear missiles.\" In August last year, Denmark said that at least one of its frigates would be equipped with a radar that would allow it to contribute to NATO's missile defense shield. In an opinion article published in the Danish newspaper Jyllands Posten on Saturday, Russian Ambassador Mikhail Vanin said he did not think the Danes fully understood the consequences of joining the missile shield. \"If this happens, Danish warships become targets for Russian nuclear missiles,\" he wrote. Denmark's Minister for Foreign Affairs Martin Lidegaard said Vanin's remarks were unacceptable. \"Russia knows full well that NATO's missile defense is defensive and not targeted at them (Russia),\" Lidegaard said.\"However, I would not over-dramatize this. Right now we disagree with Russia on many important issues, but we also cooperate, for example, in the Arctic and it is important that the tone between us does not escalate. We certainly are not contributing to that.\" Tensions between Russia and NATO member countries have been mounting since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and claims its military has been involved in the ongoing violence in eastern Ukraine. Moscow has repeatedly denied its military is involved. In April 2014, NATO foreign ministers said they had \"decided to suspend all practical civilian and military cooperation between NATO and Russia\" over the issue. The United States and NATO allies have been conducting military exercises as part of \"Operation Atlantic Resolve,\" which the United States describes as \"a demonstration of our continued commitment to the collective security of NATO and dedication to the enduring peace and stability in the region, in light of the Russian intervention in Ukraine specifically.\" On March 2, NATO Deputy Secretary General Alexander Vershbow told the alliance's annual meeting on arms control: \"Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and its continuing destabilization of Eastern Ukraine have put the European security system -- and all the rules and agreements that underpin it -- under severe strain.\" Last Monday, state-run Russian media reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered his Northern Fleet \"to full alert in a snap combat readiness exercise\" in the Arctic. At least one Russian leader described the drill as routine and unrelated to the \"international situation.\" Conversely, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexey Meshkov told Tass news agency that Russia was \"deeply concerned\" about NATO drills near its border. NATO says the long-term goal of its missile shield  is \"to merge individual Allies' missile defense assets into a coherent defense system, providing full protection for NATO European populations, territory and forces against ballistic missiles threats.\" NATO has previously asked Russia to participate in the system, but negotiations were deadlocked over Russia's demand for a legally binding treaty guaranteeing the shield would not be used as a deterrent to Moscow's own systems.","highlights":"Denmark slams Russia's envoy for warning against joining the NATO missile shield .\nAmbassador Mikhail Vanin says he did not think the Danes fully understood the consequences .\nJoining would make Danish warships \"targets for Russian nuclear missiles,\" Vanin says ."}

{"article":"(CNN)\"Hey dude -- can you turn your music down?\" If anyone says this to you while you're wearing your earbuds, take note: You are probably endangering your hearing. More than one billion teens and young adults are at risk of losing their hearing, according to WHO (that's the World Health Organization, not the rock band). It's not just old folks who suffer hearing loss. Just by listening to music at what you probably think is a normal level, or hanging out in loud bars, nightclubs and music and sporting events, you can permanently damage your hearing. By analyzing listening habits of 12- to 35-year-olds in wealthier countries around the world, WHO found nearly 50% of those studied listen to unsafe sound levels on personal audio devices and about 40% are exposed to damaging levels of music and noise at entertainment venues. It doesn't take much time to damage your hearing at a sports bar or nightclub. According to the WHO, \"exposure to noise levels of 100 dB, which is typical in such venues, is safe for no more than 15 minutes.\" Once you lose your hearing, it won't come back. Rapper Plan B and Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin know that all too well.  They both suffer from tinnitus, hearing loss that causes a permanent and irritating ringing in the ears, because they didn't protect their hearing.  Now they've joined forces with a British hearing loss association to warn others. \"I suffer from tinnitus,\" says Plan B on actionhearingloss.org.  \"When I first developed it, I thought it was trains rushing by my house as I live near a railway line. It was really loud and an extremely high pitched ringing in my ears.  I now have to wear special earplugs when I go to bed to help stop my ears from ringing.\" \"Looking after your ears is unfortunately something you don't think about until there's a problem,\" says Martin.  \"I've had tinnitus for about 10 years, and since I started protecting my ears, it hasn't got any worse (touch wood). But I wish I'd thought about it earlier.\" When it comes to personal listening devices, the level of damage you can cause to your ears is directly correlated to how long you listen and how loud the sound.   \"Unsafe levels of sounds can be, for example, exposure to in excess of 85dB for eight hours or 100dB for 15 minutes,\" says WHO. Eighty-five decibels isn't all that loud.  According to the Palo Alto Medical Foundation, it's about the level of city traffic that you'd heard from inside your car. Some 360 million of us have already suffered moderate to severe hearing loss, according to the UN Health Agency Worldwide.  While that number does include factors out of our control, such as aging, genetics, birth defects, infections and disease, about half of all cases were avoidable. That's why WHO has launched the Make Listening Safe initiative.  Part of the campaign is to encourage manufacturers to create audio safety features on devices and then educate consumers on how to use them. WHO is also calling on governments to create and enforce recreational noise legislation. \"Parents, teachers and physicians can educate young people about safe listening, while managers of entertainment venues can respect the safe noise levels set by their respective venues, use sound limiters and offer earplugs and 'chill out' rooms to patrons,\" says WHO. In the end, it's up to each of us to protect our own hearing. The good news is that it's easy to do. When it comes to your personal audio devices, such as your smartphone: . -- Turn the volume down. Don't go above 60%. -- Wear noise canceling earbuds, or better yet, headphones. -- Take \"listening breaks\" or only listen for just an hour a day . -- Get an app for that. Download a smartphone app to help monitor safe listening levels. And the next time you go to a bar, nightclub, sports event or concert, use ear protection. Martin does. \"Now we always use moulded filter plugs, or in-ear monitors, to try and protect our ears,\" says Martin.  And his kids never go to a concert without big, noise-canceling headphones.","highlights":"50% of those studied listen to unsafe sound levels on personal audio devices .\nDamaging levels of noise also come from spending time in loud bars or sporting events .\nColdplay's Chris Martin and rapper Plan B wish they'd protected their ears ."}
{"article":"(CNN)NBC is upping its live musical game. The network on Monday announced that \"The Wiz\" will be its next live musical performance \u2014 with Cirque du Soleil boarding the project with plans to bring the show to Broadway in 2016. NBC's \"The Wiz,\" set for Thursday, Dec. 3, will again be executive produced by Sound of Music and Peter Pan duo Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, with Tony-winning director Kenny Leon attached to direct both the live event as well as the Broadway revival in 2016-17. Tony winner and Broadway icon Harvey Fierstein will contribute new material to the original book by William F. Brown and work alongside Zadan, Meron and Leon. Leon won a 2014 Tony Award for directing \"A Raisin in the Sun,\" and earned a nomination for \"Fences.\" Fierstein, as a writer, won Tonys for \"La Cage Aux Folles\" and \"Torch Song Trilogy.\" He's also written books for musical hits including \"Kinky Boots\" and \"Newsies.\" As an actor, he's won Tonys for best actor in a musical (\"Hairspray\") and best actor in a play (\"Torch Song\"). \"We love this yearly tradition and we're more excited than ever to not only bring another Broadway musical to America's living rooms, but also see it land on Broadway as well,\" NBC Entertainment chairman Bob Greenblatt said. \"It's a natural next step for our live musical events, and we're so pleased to be in business with this award-winning creative team and Scott Zeiger, president and managing director of Cirque du Soleil's new theatrical division. Cirque's incredible imagination will help bring the fantasy world of Oz vividly to life and give this great show a modern spin on the age-old story we all love.\" Broadway musicals that have sung their way to the big screen . Zadan and Meron will reunite with Leon, with whom they worked on \"Steel Magnolias\" and \"A Raisin in the Sun.\" Universal Television will produce. Casting for both the NBC telecast and Cirque's Broadway production will be announced at a later date. \"The Wiz\" is adapted from L. Frank Baum's \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,\" with a book by Brown and music and lyrics by Charlie Smalls. The production opened on Broadway in 1975 at the Majestic Theatre and won seven Tonys, including best musical. It ran for four years. TV ratings: 'Peter Pan Live!' falls from 'Sound of Music' \"The Wiz\" is a retelling of \"Oz\" in an African-American\/multicultural context. It was adapted as a film in 1978 starring Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Lena Horne and Richard Pryor. It centers on Dorothy, a young woman from Kansas, who is swept up in a tornado and relocated to a fantasy world inhabited by munchkins, good and bad witches, and flying monkeys. She eventually takes a path down a yellow brick road to find a wizard who can help her go home. Along the way, she meets a scarecrow, tin man and cowardly lion, who all learn to help one another. NBC chief tackles Bill Cosby, live musicals and comedy woes . For NBC, \"The Wiz\" combines two of TV's biggest trends: live programming and the growing appetite for diversity \u2014 both in terms of casting and programming that best reflect society today. It comes as networks continue to look to live programming like sporting events and awards shows in a bid to break through the clutter in a crowded DVR landscape. In terms of diversity, the success of Fox's hip-hop drama \"Empire\" and other scripted entries including \"Black-ish\" as well as \"Fresh Off the Boat,\" \"Cristela,\" \"Scandal\" and \"How to Get Away With Murder\" have prompted a crush of diverse castings again this pilot season. \"The Wiz\" was one of two productions NBC had been eyeing (alongside \"A Few Good Men\" and \"Music Man\").

{"article":"Charleston, South Carolina (CNN)Thirty years or so ago, the synagogue in Washington DC where I was attending Yom Kippur services received a bomb threat. As we evacuated the building, I was concerned that people didn't seem to be taking it seriously. I was visiting from Europe, where terrorism was a fact of life, and I was scared. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s in Europe, and even beyond, far-left and far-right extremists, the IRA, radical Palestinians, and a variety of other groups carried out thousands of terror attacks, big and small, that left thousands dead or injured. Jewish, Israeli -- and American -- sites were targets of some of the most notorious attacks: from the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics, to plane and cruise ship hijackings, to attacks on airports, synagogues, and simply places where Jews congregated, such as the Jo Goldenberg kosher deli in Paris, where six died and 22 were wounded in a bloody attack in August 1982. In Rome, where I lived for parts of the 1970s and '80s, we tended to avoid certain streets where El Al and U.S. airlines had their offices. The first big story I helped cover as a young reporter was a bloody attack at the city's Fiumicino airport in December 1973. A dozen years later, the daughter of friends was killed in another Palestinian attack there. The main synagogue in Rome has been under tight guard since Palestinian attackers threw hand grenades and sprayed machinegun fire at worshippers after services in October 1982, killing a toddler and wounding dozens. I don't want to discount the gravity and horror of recent terror attacks against Jewish targets in Europe, such as in Copenhagen and Paris. I just want to add some perspective. Many things have changed over the decades. Post-Cold War power vacuums and Middle East upheavals have given rise to radical Islamism and globalized Jihadist terror networks whose message, fanned out via the internet and social media, strikes a chord in disaffected youth. To be sure, Jews are being targeted. But it is important to recognize that Jews are being targeted as part of a violent campaign against western democracies and western values in general. Today's victims of Islamist terror include Christians and Muslims as well as Jews. In the Middle East and Africa, women, children, students, and cultural heritage -- history -- are also directly targeted. In some ways, today's Jihadist terrorists can be seen as harnessing various types of terrorism we saw in earlier decades: the anti-Jewish\/anti-Israel terrorism of radical Palestinian groups and the anti-establishment, even anarchistic terrorism of homegrown groups whose aim was to sow fear and destabilize society as a means to bring down the system. Anti-Semitism takes many forms. Criticism of Israel is legitimate (and sometimes necessary), but it can, and sometimes does, cross the line. This isn't new either, however. Jews in Europe have been regarded -- and scapegoated -- as surrogates for Israel for decades. In 1967-68, after Israel defeated Arab states in the Six-Day War, Poland's communist regime staged an \"anti-Zionist\" campaign that forced most of the remaining Jews out of the country. At least 13,000 Jews emigrated, according to Dariusz Stola, who is now the director of the Museum of the History of Polish Jews. Other experts put the figure as high as 20,000. This was -- and remains -- by far the most widespread episode of anti-Semitism in post-Holocaust Europe. Twenty years later, in 1988, a report by the Anti-Defamation League warned that a significant number of anti-Semitic incidents in the United States now reflected \"a politically-related anti-Israel component.\" A JTA news report at the time quoted ADL National Director Abraham Foxman as noting that the phenomenon was new in the United States, but \"it's been a common occurrence in European countries.\" Particularly worrisome, the report said, were Israel-related anti-Semitic incidents on college campuses. Sound familiar? After the Holocaust, it was common to view Jews in Europe as sitting with their suitcases packed, just in case. But -- unlike Poland's \"anti-Zionist\" campaign -- terrorism did not prove an existential threat to Jews and did not prompt a mass exodus. Nor should -- or will -- it now. The Nazis, followed by Communist rule in half of the continent, almost succeeded in making Europe Judenrein. Following the most recent terror attacks, Jewish and European national leaders have made clear that this is not an option. Moreover, despite the terrorist threat, European governments have refused to budge in their defense of democratic values. It is wise to be on guard, of course, and there is indeed ample cause for alarm -- even fear. But we should also be on guard against something else -- against a facile temptation to cry wolf that can all too easily distort alarm into alarmism -- and fear into fear-mongering.","highlights":"Ruth Ellen Gruber says the victims of today's Islamist terror attacks include Christians and Muslims as well as Jews.\nShe says terrorism in the 1970s and '80s did not prove an existential threat to Jews or prompt a mass exodus, and nor should it now."}
{"article":"(CNN)Growing up in Germany, everything Felix von der Osten learned about Native Americans came from the books of 19th-century German writer Karl May. May's most beloved characters, a noble Apache leader named Winnetou and his cowboy blood brother Old Shatterhand, are said to be more popular today in Germany than the works of Thomas Mann, the 20th-century Nobel Prize-winning author of \"Death in Venice.\" It wasn't until von der Osten drove through South Dakota last year, bearing witness to modest homes and trailers on tribal land in the majestic Black Hills, that he realized how one-dimensional his perceptions were. Intrigued, the 25-year-old photographer began researching Native American history. What he learned about its brutal conquest and fraught modern existence inspired him to return to Indian Country to capture the good, the bad and the ugly. \"I wanted to show a slice of life (through) the beauty and richness of the culture,\" he said. \"I didn't want to do reportage. I wanted to do slow and thoughtful photographs, like historical documents.\" By chance he landed in Montana's Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, home to 7,000 members of the Gros Ventre (Aaniiih) and the Assiniboine (Nakoda) tribes on 675,147 acres of land near the Canadian border. His American girlfriend had distant relatives living there who supported his idea and invited him to stay in their home. His first stop upon arriving in October was to present his idea to the Fort Belknap tribal leadership. With their approval, he spent his first week walking around without his camera, introducing himself to tribal members and building relationships. \"The most important thing was I sat down, listened and learned,\" he said. \"I opened my ears and let them talk so they could teach me.\" Over time, they opened their homes to him and his camera. His choice of a Pentax 67 medium-format roll film camera forced him to carefully consider each shot, to \"create images\" in his head before taking them. It left him with a focused body of work. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. He captured sacred tribal rituals and ceremonies along with the more mundane, familiar aspects of life: the tribal basketball team, a horse grazing in a field, a girl sitting on a bunk bed with a stuffed pony, the inside of a casino. Through conversations with tribal members, he also learned of the harsh realities of life on the reservation, from the difficulties youths face in pursuing educational opportunities to the drug and alcohol addiction killing some members. He put the camera away for some of his most memorable experiences -- a sit in the sweat lodge, dinner with his host family -- the ones that formed lasting relationships and earned him the nickname \"the man who crossed the ocean.\" By revealing just a slice, he hopes to arouse curiosity in viewers and inspire them to learn more \"to connect the dots.\" It's something he plans to continue doing by returning this summer to learn and experience more. \"The story's not finished,\" he said. \"It's a big sensitive topic and you have to be very careful, and I want to be careful.\" Felix von der Osten is a German photographer.

{"article":"Seyne-les-Alpes, France (CNN)It's a dangerous task as well as a grim one. The rescue workers battling to gather the pulverized pieces of Germanwings Flight 9525 and the remains of the 150 people on board must contend with high winds as well as treacherous terrain. They climb up a rugged mountain, appearing to cling to its side by their fingernails. Bit by bit, bag by bag, high wire daredevils hoist body bags hundreds of feet up to waiting helicopters, trying to remain stable in the high winds.  Rescuers pin red flags on the earth when they discover new fragments. Winched down from helicopters on to the steep, icy slopes, where debris lies scattered across hundreds of meters, workers have had to be tied together in two-person teams. One is there to carry out the investigation and recovery. The second is charged with ensuring their safety as they're buffeted by the weather. Complicating matters, very few of the bodies have been found whole, Yves Naffrechoux, captain of rescue operations, told CNN on Friday. And winds have picked up, making it difficult for helicopters to ferry the workers to the site in the French Alps in the first place, he said. Authorities have deployed 45 Alpine police officers to help forensics teams -- not accustomed to working in mountain ravines -- recover the bodies safely, Naffrechoux said. His team is based out of Seyne-les-Alpes, a normally sleepy Alpine village that since Tuesday's crash has been transformed into a hub for the recovery operation. The leaders of Germany, France and Spain have visited. The families of the victims have laid flowers and prayed at a nearby memorial. Journalists have flocked to the spot as they report the latest developments. Meanwhile, the rescue workers have continued their hazardous mission. Before anything could be recovered, the position of the bodies and debris had to be mapped. Human remains must be treated with due respect despite the tricky conditions. The workers are now removing more bodies from the site, Naffrechoux said. The priority remains to find all the bodies and the elusive second \"black box,\" the plane's flight data recorder, he said. Investigators hope, once found, it could yield more clues into what happened on the flight deck of the Germanwings plane before it slammed into the mountainside at about 430 miles per hour. Already, the Marseille prosecutor, Brice Robin, has revealed that cockpit audio indicated that German co-pilot Andreas Lubitz \"wanted to destroy the aircraft.\" The recovery teams are trying to construct a road to access the site more quickly and aid the transportation of bodies to a DNA testing center where they are kept in refrigerated units, said Naffrechoux. It's hoped the process will take 10 to 15 days, depending on weather, he said. Testimonials posted by France's Interior Ministry from rescue and recovery workers at the scene also give an insight into the tough conditions at the remote crash site. Cmdr. Emmanuel G., of the Criminal Research Institute from the National Gendarmerie, said it was a \"really complicated\" process. \"We are working in two-person teams, whether it's alongside (police) mountain guides, the local gendarmes or the alpine firemen and emergency teams,\" he said. \"We do not know how to continue in this situation otherwise, we really need them to ensure our security at all times.\" \"It's the first time police technicians and gendarmes are working together,\" an unnamed technician in one of those two-person teams is quoted as saying. \"We have total trust in each other. He's holding my life in his hands.\" CNN's Antonia Mortensen and Nic Robertson reported from Seyne-les-Alpes and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported from London. CNN's Karl Penhaul,  Ariana Williams and Dheeptika Laurent contributed to this report.","highlights":"High winds are complicating efforts to recover remains and aircraft debris from the mountainous crash site .\nCaptain of rescue operations tells CNN that very few bodies have been found whole .\nRecovery workers are being winched down in pairs, one to gather remains and the other to ensure safety ."}
{"article":"Captain Eoin Morgan will not entertain thoughts of a premature World Cup exit even though a nine-wicket defeat by Sri Lanka left England on the brink of disaster. England suffered yet more pain at the Wellington Regional Stadium as centuries from Lahiru Thirimanne and Kumar Sangakkara inspired a record pursuit of 309 for six. Defeat leaves England needing to beat lower-ranked Bangladesh and Afghanistan in their remaining pool games and, even then, it might not be enough to keep them alive. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cricket World Cup Highlights: England vs Sri Lanka . Eoin Morgan talks to the press after another disappointing defeat for England at the Cricket World Cup . Kumar Sangakkara (centre) hit 117 not out and, alongside Lahiru Thirimanne, put England to the sword . Morgan was not willing to consider the prospect, however, of an early flight home after his side's third loss in four games at the tournament. 'It's not even a thought at the moment,' he said. 'Two games to win to get us into a quarter-final.' Morgan's side never got going in both of those games, but after Joe Root's career-best 121 had put England in the box seat at the half-way stage, the bowlers posed little threat as Thirimanne and Sangakkara embarked on an unbeaten 212-run stand to coast home with 16 balls in hand. 'It definitely is harder to take,' Morgan said. 'When you don't turn up for a race like those first two games it's scratched. Today when we turn up and we're beaten in the fashion we were is harder to take.' One-day captain Morgan (centre) leads England off the pitch in Wellington after their nine-wicket defeat . Thirimanne (left) and Sangakkara helped Sri Lanka to a comfortable win over England in New Zealand . Morgan bemoaned a bowling performance in which he claimed England simply bowled too many bad balls. Thirimanne certainly agreed, after he had suggested in his earlier press conference that batting against England's bowlers had been 'very easy'. The opener was asked to compare England's attack to Afghanistan, who almost pulled off a stunning win over Sri Lanka earlier in the tournament, and said: 'To be honest that day Afghanistan's bowlers did really well but there was a little bit for the seamers. 'Today it was very easy for me to be honest.' Morgan was at a loss to explain why his bowlers were so ineffective and will wait to see a statistical breakdown of England's bowling performance in the next couple of days when they will take time off after flying to Adelaide. Thirimanne plays a shot on the way to scoring a century as Sri Lanka made light work of England's bowlers . Thirimanne is almost down on one knee during his knock (left) as he celebrates with\u00a0Sangakkara (right) 'No. I don't have a theory yet,' he said. 'We bowled a lot of bad balls. Over the next couple of days we'll get the HawkEye stuff back and the proof will be in that. My feeling is we bowled a lot of bad balls.' The skipper denied that the England attack was too predictable in the light of Thirimanne's observations, adding: 'In terms of being too predictable you look at the best sides and they're predictably good. When we're firing we are predictably good. 'We've got two tall guys who are effective, they've got pace and bounce, and two guys who swing the ball and Moeen who does his job. 'When we bowl well we put sides under pressure and create opportunities - today we didn't.' Root celebrates  after reaching a century against Sri Lanka, but it wasn't enough to secure a win for England . Morgan, post-match, did not entertain thoughts of an early exit, instead remaining confident of progression . England were not helped by missing opportunities in the field, most significantly when Root grassed a chance at first slip off Stuart Broad when Thirimanne was on just three. The Sri Lanka openers then put on a century stand to pave the way for a chase that easily broke the previous record at the ground - 254 for four achieved by South Africa against New Zealand three years ago. 'You can talk about the chances we put down. Thirimanne was one,' Morgan said. 'It would have brought Sangakkara to the wicket earlier with more chance of him getting out. He played well. He came in an ideal situation.' England have now been soundly beaten by the three sides ranked higher than them in the group and, should they reach the knockout stages, there is apparently a large gap to be bridged if they are to make any impression. 'Losing any game is always a concern,' Morgan added. James Taylor drops a catch on the boundary as England failed to build on their score in Wellington . Sangakkara and team-mate Thirimanne shake hands with Morgan after Sri Lanka's nine-wicket win . 'Over the next few days, we'll have them off, and then we'll reconvene. Me and Mooresy will have a sit down along with the backroom staff and debrief the game and see where we've gone wrong and how we can get better.' Morgan is confident, though, that he will have no problem in lifting his young squad who now have an eight-day gap to stew over their latest defeat before they meet Bangladesh at the Adelaide Oval. 'It's not a big deal getting those guys up,' he said. 'It's a World Cup everybody is like a kid at Christmas, they want to play and they want to win. That part of it is easy. 'It's simple things moving forward. I keep banging on about them because we haven't done them so far this World Cup. 'The simpler we keep it moving forward, the more obvious what we do or have to do over the next 10 days. That will be the message from me to the players.'","highlights":"Sri Lanka beat England by nine wickets at the Cricket World Cup .\nThe defeat leaves England with three losses from their first four matches .\nEoin Morgan will not entertain thoughts of a premature World Cup exit .\nEngland need to beat Bangladesh and Afghanistan in their final two matches, and even that might not be enough to see them through ."}
{"article":"Forget Groundhog Day. For suffering Scotland captain Greig Laidlaw, it is beginning to feel more like Groundhog Year. There has been an increasingly familiar pattern to his addresses in the aftermath of every one of his team\u2019s four defeats in this Six Nations campaign so far. He has talked of the positives to take from each loss while trying his best to put the bravest of faces on matters. As he sat at BT Murrayfield on Tuesday following a tough training session with his international colleagues, his mask didn\u2019t slip one bit as he went through the same old routine. Greig Laidlaw  in action during the Six Nations rugby match between France and Scotland at Stade de France . But behind the forced smile it was clear there is a new fear engulfing him which makes the final Six Nations match against Ireland on Saturday an increasingly nervous prospect. The scrum-half with 38 caps to his name doesn\u2019t want to join Chris Paterson and Ross Ford in the record books as a captain who led Scotland to a Six Nations wooden spoon. Paterson did it twice, in 2004 and 2007, with Ford suffering a similar fate in 2012. Since Five Nations became Six, Italy have been bottom of the pile 10 times with Wales and France finishing last once each. England and Ireland have never picked up the wooden spoon. Laidlaw, who played stand-off rather than scrum-half in the side that was whitewashed under Ford, doesn\u2019t want to experience that feeling again. He is hoping his team-mates feel as embarrassed as he is about the current plight and use the fear of failure as motivation to put things right against the Irish. \u2018I don\u2019t know if it hurts me as captain more than the other players, but losing all our games so far certainly hurts me a lot, that\u2019s for sure,\u2019 said the 29-year-old. \u2018I like to think avoiding the wooden spoon is a big driving factor whether you are captain or not, as nobody wants to be in the team that\u2019s failed to pick up any wins. \u2018Remember, though, we haven\u2019t finished bottom yet and we\u2019ve got an opportunity this weekend to finish on a high. If we can win this one, it allows us to give a big sigh of relief going into the pre-World Cup games over the summer and then build towards the World Cup. Laidlaw leaves the field after the second half of the the RBS Six Nations match between against Italy . \u2018The other side of the coin is that if we lose this one, it\u2019s a long time before we play for Scotland again and that\u2019s the worst situation to be in. At least we have a week to try to rectify some of the problems that were there against England and give everybody the boost they want by turning things around against Ireland.\u2019 Laidlaw admitted he has been left totally frustrated at how his side had come up short in all their matches and fallen away badly in the second half of key games. Although he believes all is not lost, he is clearly growing tired of constantly being the one trying to explain away in public what is going wrong. \u2018I\u2019ve almost been saying the same things most weeks, unfortunately,\u2019 he continued. \u2018I still believe there are huge positives in there and I think everybody, including ourselves, can see some of the play is brilliant and the players get confidence from that. \u2018I know the English boys and the Welsh boys, in particular, think that we\u2019re now a threat and a much better team than we were in the past despite the defeats. We are getting close to winning but need to do that little bit extra to get over the line. \u2018Of course there are things to look at and, for instance, we\u2019re getting to half-time in good positions but maybe dropping off slightly, which is something we need to sort. VIDEO 02 Inside Line: England v Scotland match review . Ben Youngs hands off the tackle of Laidlaw  during the match between England and Scotland at Twickenham . \u2018Looking back at the England game, that is what happened as there wasn\u2019t enough urgency in the early part of the second half and we just let England come at us. There\u2019s only so much you can soak up before cracking and we can\u2019t let that happen again.\u2019 Murrayfield will have a capacity attendance for the match against Ireland, with many visiting fans making up the 67,000 crowd. Irish supporters had bought their tickets within hours of them going on sale on the assumption their team would be challenging for the Grand Slam. A clean sweep is no longer a possibility after their defeat to Wales last weekend but, even with tens of thousands inside the stadium cheering on Joe Schmidt\u2019s title contenders, Laidlaw still believes the Scotland players can be inspired by the atmosphere within Murrayfield. \u2018We want to win for the jersey, win for ourselves, win for the fans, because they\u2019ve been brilliant throughout a tough campaign,\u2019 he said. \u2018We can feed off them hugely and want to go out there and give them something back for their continued support. We really want to send them off on a good note, because it\u2019s been a tough championship for the players and fans alike.\u2019 Laidlaw stands dejected after the final whistle during the RBS 6 Nations match at Twickenham . A win over Ireland would indeed have the fans singing a happier tune. For that to happen, Ford insists there is nothing to be gained from dwelling too much on the results which have brought Scotland to this precarious position. \u2018We need to be realistic, look at where we aren\u2019t good enough and try to improve,\u2019 said the Edinburgh hooker, capped 84 times. \u2018We need to stay positive going into the games and it is a huge positive to know we have pushed good teams close and scored tries against them. \u2018There is no point getting down as it doesn\u2019t get you anywhere on the pitch. It\u2019s about staying positive and getting right back out and going after Ireland. \u2018It would be great to finish the campaign on a high, especially at home. It is a World Cup year, so it would be a very positive note to end the Six Nations on.\u2019","highlights":"Greig Laidlaw doesn\u2019t want to join Chris Paterson and Ross Ford .\nThe duo led Scotland to the wooden spoon in 2004, 2007 and 2012 .\nEngland and Ireland have never picked up the wooden spoon .\nSince five nations became six, Italy have been bottom of the pile 10 times ."}

{"article":"London (CNN)Archaeologists have started excavating about 3,000 skeletons from the Bedlam burial ground in London, used from 1569 to at least 1738. Also known as Bethlem and the New Churchyard, more than 20,000 Londoners are believed to have been buried there. The ground was used by \"a varied cross-section of society throughout the years since the burial ground was open,\" Nick Elsden, project manager from MOLA (Museum of London Archaeology) told CNN. And they include those who could not afford a church burial or chose to perish there for religious or political reasons. The ground also contained the overflow of bodies when other cemeteries became full. Bedlam, now a synonym for chaos, took its name from the Hospital of St Mary of Bethlehem in London which nursed the mentally ill. Among the deceased are victims of the English Civil War, the Great Plague of 1665 and the Great Fire of London in the following year. The site was found at an entrance of the city's new Liverpool Street Crossrail station -- part of a \u00a314.8 billion ($22 billion) project that will expand London's railway network.

Elsden said the excavation reveals a great deal about how Londoners lived from the 16th to the 18th century. \"A large sample of the population from that period will enable us to look at the lifestyle, looking at Roman London and what the Romans were doing in the suburb area, outside the city walls.\" He said the skeletons will be cleaned and closely examined by experts who will assess their remains to determine their diseases, ages and sexes. \"Specialists will look at the DNA of the disease that killed the person rather than their own DNA,\" he added. Roman skulls unearthed deep beneath London . The findings are timely as well -- this year marks the 350th anniversary of the Great Plague in London. \"1665 was the very last recorded episode of plague. There were 400 years of regular plague, and suddenly it stops,\" Jay Carver, Crossrail's lead archaeologist, said. \"And what we want to be able to find out, from sampling the graves of that date, is why that is. And what it is about the bacteria that causes bubonic plague that suddenly changed at that point.\" Londoners also assisted in the research by helping to search parish records to identify people who were buried in Bedlam. \"And that was a huge exercise which couldn't have possibly been done by our own team,\" Carver said. Skeletons found holding hands after 700 years . The result is a database of more than 5,300 names and backgrounds of those buried at Bedlam, including political activists John Lilburne and Robert Lockyer -- part of a movement known as the Levellers --as well as Ambrose Nicholas, the Lord Mayor of London in 1575. A Roman road that runs underneath the site has already produced artefacts such as horseshoes and cremation urns. Carver describes the Bedlam dig as a personal career highlight. \"[It's a] great use of an engineering scheme, but at the same time addresses the historical importance of each these sites.\" London rail excavation unearths suspected 'plague pit'","highlights":"Digging has begun at the Bedlam burial ground in London .\nTaking its name from a hospital for the mentally ill, Bedlam is now a synonym for chaos ."}
{"article":"(CNN)In fairy tales, it's usually the princess that needs protecting. At Google's headquarters in Silicon Valley, the princess is the one defending the castle. Meet Parisa Tabriz, the 31-year-old with perhaps the most enchanted job title in engineering -- \"Google Security Princess.\" Her job is to hack into the most popular web browser on the planet, trying to find flaws in the system before the \"black hats\" do. Indeed, much like the good and bad witches of the Wizard of Oz, hackers are described as having \"white\" or \"black\" hats. To defeat Google's attackers, Tabriz must firstly think like them. In this cyberspace battle, the data of around a billion Chrome users hangs in the balance -- and Tabriz wasn't going to settle for any old moniker. \"When I started, my official job title was 'Information Security Engineer,' which I thought was a bit boring and not really meaningful,\" said the Iranian-Polish-American, speaking a million miles an hour over the phone from Google HQ. \"So I changed it to 'Security Princess' as more of a tongue-in-cheek thing. I've never been exceptionally girly or fit the stereotype of a princess, so it was a bit ironic for me to go by that name -- and then it stuck!\" Tabriz's role has evolved dramatically in the eight years since she first started working at Google. Back then, the young graduate from Illinois University was one of 50 security engineers -- today there are over 500. \"Our users include presidents of foreign countries -- I hope Obama uses Chrome too. It includes really highly-targeted individuals, political dissidents, journalists, and people who just want to casually use the internet,\" she said. \"Google depends on those users trusting us with their data. So if we can't protect it, we have no business.\" Cybercrime has come a long way in the past decade -- from the cliched Nigerian Prince Scam to credit card theft, and suspected government surveillance over emails. Tabriz's biggest concern now is the people who find bugs in Google's software, and sell the information to governments or criminals. To combat this, the company has set up a Vulnerability Rewards Program, paying anywhere from $100 to $20,000 for reported glitches. \"What we've seen in the last couple of years is what we suspect to be governments trying to intercept communications,\" said Tabriz. \"In one case, there were Iranian-region Gmail users whose connection was being intercepted.\" \"These incidents are especially scary since they seem to be carried out by large, well-funded organizations or governments,\" she added. It's a world away from Tabriz's computer-free childhhod home in Chicago. The daughter of an Iranian-American doctor father, and Polish-American nurse mother, Tabriz had little contact with computers until she started studying engineering at college. Gaze across a line-up of Google security staff today and you'll find women like Tabriz are few and far between -- though in the last few years she has hired more female tech whizzes. She admits there's an obvious gender imbalance in Silicon Valley, but for once is stumped on the fault. \"Clearly the numbers make you think 'what is the problem that there aren't more women working in security, that there aren't more women working in technology?\" she said. \"And it does make me think what is the problem here? Is it the culture or the atmosphere?\" Funnily enough, during training sessions Tabriz first asks new recruits to hack not a computer, but a vending machine. \"There's this idea that you need to be a super genius computer geek to be a hacker. But in reality, I think anybody can be a hacker in the real world -- just think of all the non-software examples,\" said Tabriz. \"A lot of people ask me what's the best answer I've been given to the vending machine problem, and the real answer is there is none. Some people think about how they'd steal their favorite snack; some people figure out how to steal the entire machine of snacks; and some people figure out how they could add some sort of functionality to the machine that wasn't there before\" Tabriz's job is as much about technological know-how, as understanding the psychology of attackers. \"Anybody who's working in defense -- police officers, security, or law enforcement -- has to stop and think 'what is the enemy or the attacker going to do?'\" she said. \"Because you always want to stay one step ahead of them.\" Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: .

{"article":"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)In just a few weeks, good relations with neighbors have become a matter of survival for Yemen's President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. On Saturday, he joined his allies in Egypt, while battles raged on in his country. After Houthi rebels occupied the capital Sanaa weeks ago, his government fled. When Hadi called for military intervention to beat back their attempt to overthrow him, adjacent countries answered with a grand airstrike operation. In the darkness of early Saturday, their jets increased the hail of ordnance on Sanaa, as Saudi led operation al-Hazm Storm went into its third day. And Hadi waited in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt to meet with the region's leaders at the Arab League summit. This past \"night was by far the scariest night since the raids started,\" said journalist Hakim Almasmari in Sanaa. \"The strikes were so strong and continuous.\" The jets bombarded Hadi's weapons caches and other military assets, Houthi and Yemeni government officials said. Saudi Arabia has blockaded the Houthis, effectively cutting off their supply lines, and its air force controls Yemeni airspace. Saudi Arabia and Egypt have spoken about the possibility of putting boots on the ground. The Arab League is expected to give its official blessing to al-Hazm Storm on Saturday, which could clear the way for a ground invasion, CNN's Becky Anderson reported. But a few member nations, such as Shiite majority Iraq or possibly Algeria, could give military action a thumbs down. Though the Saudi kingdom has taken the lead with some 100 warplanes, the coalition partners include the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Jordan, Morocco, Sudan and Egypt. Arab Spring wasn't supposed to turn out like this . Together they comprise about a third of the Arab League's membership. They are majority Sunni Muslim nations, and the Houthi rebels are Shiite Muslims allied with Iran. Having Yemen become an Iranian satellite country on its border would be perceived as a major threat by neighboring Saudi Arabia, which sees the Houthis as proxies of Tehran, Saudi Arabia's bitter rival on the Persian Gulf. Iran has sharply denounced the armed intervention. The United States, on the other hand, strongly approves of it and is supporting it logistically, and aiding coalition forces in locating targets, but it is not participating in active battle. A small contingency of U.S. forces had been stationed in Yemen to help in the fight against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, but left once Houthi rebels took the capital. Dozens of people have died in the strikes, and on Saturday, Human Rights Watch said many of the victims were civilians, perhaps as many as 34. \"Reports of air strikes and anti-aircraft weapons in heavily populated areas raise serious concerns that not enough is being done to ensure their safety,\" HRW regional spokesman Joe Stork said. A Saudi Arabia defense official blamed civilian deaths on the Houthis, saying they were using them as human shields. Brig. Gen. Ahmed bin Hasan Asiri said the kingdom's military was using precision weapons to avoid collateral damage, state-run Saudi News Agency reported. Media outlets have come under fire as well. An hour after Hadi ordered the closure of all Houthi-controlled media -- including Yemen TV and Saba TV -- Houthis raided two TV channels and the prominent Al Masdar newspaper. Al Jazeera's office in Sanaa was also targeted, the Qatar-based network said, with Houthis looting security cameras and damaging equipment. Opinion: Why Yemen has come undone . Journalist Hakim Almasmari reported from Yemen, and CNN's Ben Brumfield wrote this story from Atlanta. CNN's Becky Anderson, Salma Abdelaziz and Mustafa al-Arab contributed to this report.","highlights":"Yemen's President rallies support on Saturday in Egypt .\nArab League blessing of military action may set the stage for a ground invasion ."}

Allegations against the Lemon Township resident included burglary, kidnapping, domestic violence and criminal endangering, the Butler County Sheriff's Office posted in a message accompanying its post.

{"article":"Typical Paul O'Connell. Ireland are chasing down a possible second Grand Slam in six years and, instead of the narrative being exclusively about how Joe Schmidt's side will fare in jumping hurdle number four at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday, the skipper's 100th cap for his country is providing a smokescreen for teammates glad of a diversionary topic. O'Connell wouldn't be of a mind to mention his milestone within camp himself. But still, as a topic for his comrades to pass the time with during short media sessions, it falls into perfect, anything-but-Wales, territory. Take Devin Toner, the Leinster giant who has become O'Connell's regular second-row sidekick over the past few seasons. Paul O'Connell is preparing for his 100th cap for his country at the Millenium Stadium on Saturday . Joe Schmidt\u00a0are chasing down a possible second Grand Slam in six years at the Millenium Stadium . Ask about the general mechanics of the Irish lineout and the response is brief. 'I don't want to give anything away about lineout strategies,' he says. Enquire about the centurion, though, and there's, eventually, much greater pep to his patter. 'There's not much more to be said that hasn't already been said about Paulie. He's a world-class player and I don't think I'd be the player I am today without having played with him. 'I've learned so much from all the second rows I've played with, especially Leo Cullen and Paul. He's a massive leader in the squad, just a massive player on the pitch and players look up to him,' says Toner, who admits to closely watching O'Connell's ruck clear-outs as something he'd like to replicate. O'Connell gets angry during the Ireland training session at Kingspan Stadium  in Belfast, Northern Ireland . 'Just to get to 100 caps is a huge testament to how he has looked after himself and to play at the top level for that long (since his debut against Wales in 2002) is unbelievable. 'It was more intimidating playing against him for the first time because I didn't really fancy it to be honest,' continues Toner, adding that this provincial level fear has eroded now that they are Test colleagues. 'He wouldn't be in my head now\u2026 but he's kind of like Joe (Schmidt) in that you need to know your detail or he gets on top of you. That's a hugely good thing. 'More players should be doing it. He has driven standards along with Joe\u2026 the two of them just drive the squad. You don't want to disappoint either of them.' Mike Ross is another not shy about chipping in his tuppence-worth about the Ireland captain who lifted the Six Nations trophy in Paris last year. James Haskell  on the loose ball ahead of Devin Toner and Jordi Murphy  during the RBS Six Nations . O'Connell looks on after his teams victory during the RBS Six Nations match between Ireland and England . 'He has always led from the front. He might look a bit mad from the sidelines but he has always got this calm head. If things are going south, Paulie is a good man to bring everything back under check,' says the veteran tighthead about his fellow 35-year-old. 'When he was playing for Young Munster, I was over in Fermoy playing Junior Two or something like that. The first time I came into contact with him was at a Munster Under 20s training session. He has always stood out,' recalls Ross. 'I remember watching him take the park for a pre-season friendly, coming on for Mick O'Driscoll. He was an impressive physical specimen even then. 'Then he makes his debut against Wales and scores a try that he doesn't remember (due to concussion). Ireland captain O'Connell during the Ireland training session at Kingspan Stadium in Belfast, Northern Ireland . 'He has always made an impression whenever he gets the chance. It's a testament to the career he has had and the esteem in which he is held that he will now get his 100th cap. 'He's always looking for more at training sessions. 'He was questioning me this week on what bind feels best in a particular scrum. Even now he's still looking for new things.' The O'Connell theme done and dusted, it's on to the more serious business at hand - successfully defending the championship. This time last year, Ireland were picking up the pieces following their lost Triple Crown match at Twickenham which left them gunning for just the Six Nations title. Italy's prop Martin Castrogiovanni \u00a0is tackled by  Toner during the Six Nations clash at the Olympic Stadium . However, while they now still have everything to play for after three championship wins stretched their overall unbeaten run to a record equalling 10 matches, Toner doesn't feel there is a different dynamic to 2015's round four preparations - even though 'Grand Slam' is the phrase on every Ireland supporter's lips. 'I don't think there is much difference. If we look at it now, it's semifinal and final time, so we are in a good place. 'It's similar to last year. If we win the two games, we win the championship and the Grand Slam,' says Toner, adding that the growing hype outside their secluded Carton House base is largely passing him by, save for last Sunday's visit to his old North Kildare stomping ground. 'I don't really read the newspaper or see much that goes on. Obviously people want to talk about it but I'm just naturally relaxed about it. It doesn't really faze me. 'I don't really get hyped up at all.'","highlights":"Ireland are chasing down a possible second Grand Slam in six years .\nJoe Schmidt's side take on Wales at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday .\nIreland captain Paul O'Connell preparing for his 100th cap for his country .\nO'Connell's milestone is doing well to spread the media focus ."}
{"article":"Playing Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals holds no fears for Doneil Henry - providing he does not have to take the train to Anfield. The Canadian's whirlwind beginning to life at Blackburn looks set to continue with a starting spot on Sunday. Injury problems in defence prompted Rovers boss Gary Bowyer to take Henry on a month's loan from West Ham on Wednesday, the same day they played Sheffield Wednesday in the Championship. Three hours after meeting his team-mates for the first time, Henry walked out onto the pitch at Hillsborough and was instrumental in the victory that just about keeps Blackburn's play-off hopes alive. Doneil Henry made a good start to his Blackburn career after joining on loan from West Ham . Henry said: 'I got a call from the manager in the morning and I was told I was going on loan and I was hopefully playing that night. 'I had to collect my stuff from Upton Park, sign some paperwork and then be on a train. I got on the wrong train, asked the ticket man if it was going to Sheffield to find out I had to get off and get on another train. 'After that finally I recognised some people in Blackburn kit at the train station and from there I was in safe hands. I met the team, did pre-game stuff and then just played. 'I was just really happy to play. It's been a while. I knew me thinking too much wouldn't be good, I just wanted to get on the pitch as soon as possible and establish myself in the team.' Henry began his career at home-town club Toronto and joined West Ham in January after being recommended to Hammers boss Sam Allardyce by former Toronto manager Ryan Nelsen. Nelsen played for Allardyce at Blackburn, where he was captain and a hugely popular figure. Canadian international Henry joined West Ham in January from MLS side Toronto . 'It was funny coming to Blackburn and walking through the facility and then seeing him amongst the boards,' said Henry. 'Ryan has been a mentor since he came to Toronto. He really has a lot of faith in me and has really guided me along my journey. I knew he was a big figure here and he was a solid defender everywhere he went. 'Junior Hoilett also played here, who's a close friend of mine, so I knew it would be a good move for me.' The 21-year-old has never been to Anfield before but did face Liverpool on their pre-season tour to North America in 2012. He knows securing the win needed to get to Wembley will be a huge task but has been impressed by the togetherness of the squad. Henry played against Liverpool in America in a pre-season game - but has never been to Anfield . Henry said: 'I'm still getting familiar with a lot of the guys but on the pitch it was great because there was constant chatter and communication and I just thought they believed in me from the get-go. 'When we get the test on Sunday, I think we'll definitely be ready. There's a lot of quality players in here so I think if we can go there and do our job, as long as we stay together as a team, it's definitely possible to get a result. 'I'm not going to shy away from the opportunity. These are the games where you can really see how far you are from the top level.' Bowyer is definitely without three defenders in injured trio Jason Lowe, Shane Duffy and Alex Baptiste, while Grant Hanley is a major doubt. But the Rovers boss has total faith in his new man, saying: 'Full credit to him and his character. 'He's been brought in to play games for us and we have to thank West Ham for allowing him to come to us. Everybody at West Ham spoke very highly of him and his performance on Wednesday backed that up. 'We wouldn't have any problems playing him on Sunday against Liverpool.'","highlights":"Doneil Henry joined Blackburn Rovers on loan from West Ham .\nHenry got on the wrong train when heading to meet his new team-mates in Sheffield .\nHenry and Blackburn face Liverpool at Anfield in the FA Cup ."}

{"article":"(CNN)What's your company doing this year for March Madness?  If your workplace is like most, the answer is a big fat nothing. Instead of leveraging the NCAA's annual tournament and turning it into a genuine bonding experience between colleagues, most organizations pretend it isn't happening. On the surface, ignoring a sporting event that takes place during regular work hours might appear like sound business practice. After all, companies need to generate profit, and it's hard to generate profit when your employees are huddled around a television, right? Wrong. What this perspective overlooks is that productivity isn't simply a function of how many hours we spend at the office. It also depends on the quality of our workplace experience. And one critical feature of that experience is how closely connected we feel to our colleagues. Research has consistently demonstrated that we are more effective at our jobs when we feel attached to the people around us. How do strong colleague relationships elevate our performance? For one thing, they make us more motivated. When you and your colleagues are close, failing to perform your duties generates more than a dissatisfied customer or an unhappy manager -- it means letting down your friends. The social pressure to achieve results can serve as a stronger motivator than anything a boss can say. Closer connections also foster a sense of trust and more candid dialogue. Studies comparing the collaboration patterns of friends to mere acquaintances indicate that friends are more willing to ask for help and more comfortable speaking up when a colleague is off on the wrong track. Performance aside, workplace friendships benefit organizations for another reason: Employees with richer friendships tend to stay on with their company for longer periods of time. Despite these considerable benefits, at most companies, friendships are an afterthought. To motivate employees, managers tend to rely on bonuses, promotions, and salary increases, ignoring the fact that as humans, we all have a basic psychological need for meaningful relationships. Yet the research is clear: When we feel valued and respected by those around us, we're not only more motivated -- we're also happier, healthier, and more productive. For too many organizations, investing in quality employee relationships means one thing: team-building exercises. Think ice breakers, trust falls and scavenger hunts. Every year, corporations spend millions on off-site retreats and weekend getaways packed with cringeworthy activities that purportedly foster better communication. But here's the truth: While awkward collaborations may spark brief experiences of closeness, they rarely translate into lasting friendships. So what does? Studies suggest three factors are essential to the development of authentic, meaningful friendships: familiarity (being around the same colleague often), similarity (finding commonalities in your background), and self-disclosure (revealing personal information about yourself every now and then, and having your co-worker do the same). Few activities include all three of these elements. This explains why close relationships usually take years to develop. But interestingly, office game-viewing parties come close. They present opportunities for colleagues to mingle with those from other departments and connect over shared interests. For many, the NCAA basketball tournament is associated with their experience at college, which leads them to share stories about their past, prompting co-workers to do the same. Unlike team-building experiences that compel employees to engage with one another, game-viewing parties position people to connect voluntarily. And that feature can make all the difference. In recent years, a number of forward-thinking workplaces have begun leveraging March Madness in intelligent ways. Ogilvy & Mather, for example, an international marketing agency based in New York, invites employees to watch tournament games on projection screens in conference rooms and the office cafeteria. To address the fact that not everyone has the time to follow college basketball, a Virginia financial services firm called The Motley Fool offers a free \"Bracketology\" class, where nonenthusiasts can get caught up on this year's favorites and collect advice before filling out their brackets. A number of organizations, including office furniture manufacturer Turnstone, even serve game-day snacks, such as pizza, popcorn, and chicken wings, to simulate the viewing experience of a sports bar, minus the alcohol. In addition to organizing a vibrant workplace gathering, there are also opportunities for making better use of the office tournament pool. Here's one idea: Instead of having employees pay an entry fee (which discourages nonfans from joining in), sponsor prizes so that everyone participates. Then, go beyond recognizing individual contestants and reward the team or department with the highest average score. This way, employees have reason to root for one another, fostering a sense of collaboration. Another approach worth considering: using the office pool as a motivational tool. Some years ago, NetTel Partners, a sales organization in Philadelphia, launched a competition among its salespeople in the weeks before the NCAA tournament. The more appointments a salesperson secured with potential clients, the sooner he or she could select a team in the office draft. The results were astonishing. Total cost to NetTel for furnishing prizes: $300, plus the price of a personalized basketball jersey. Total impact on the business: a 35% jump in appointments, not to mention a boost in office morale. As the NCAA tournament tips off this month, organizational leaders would be wise to re-examine their approach to March Madness. Instead of treating the tournament as a nuisance that prevents employees from working, perhaps it's time we considered embracing it for what it is: an inexpensive opportunity for bringing our work teams closer together. Without the trust falls.","highlights":"Friedman: Companies should encourage their employees to bond over NCAA tournament games .\nResearch shows the value of cultivating friendships among co-workers ."}
{"article":"West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has again criticised referee Mike Dean for his handling of Saturday's London derby defeat by Crystal Palace. The Hammers, currently in ninth place in the Premier League, were beaten 3-1 by the Eagles at the weekend in a contentious contest. Allardyce felt that Palace striker Glenn Murray, scorer of two goals at Upton Park, before being sent off in the 69th minute, should have been dismissed by Dean in the first half for persistent fouling. Glenn Murray was sent off for Crystal Palace during the 3-1 win against West Ham on Saturday . Sam Allardyce was frustrated that Murray was not sent off earlier in the game . Allardyce said: 'The biggest problem for me was that Glenn Murray shouldn't have been on the field, not only because of persistent fouling but the level of his fouling. 'Mike Dean, whom I have a lot of respect for, is a very good referee, but he was too lenient with Murray by telling him 'that's your last chance' after the first booking. 'In that particular instance, Palace have been let off. Mike Dean has a massive responsibility on the fact that (Murray) was one of the main reasons why Crystal Palace won. 'And for me that is something disappointing. The fact a referee warns a player for a tackle he has just made, which normally gets a yellow card, and yet he is only warned because he has just had a yellow card. And that is frustrating.' Murray climbed highest to open the scoring for the visitors in the first half with a header . Murray got his second and Palace's third when he glanced a header past Adrian . Palace captain Mile Jedinak was caught on Sky Sports TV cameras apparently elbowing Diafra Sakho as they both challenged for the ball in the closing stages. Though the incident was not seen at the time by the match officials, the Football Association have since charged the player with violent conduct \u2013 and Palace have until Tuesday evening to appeal against that decision. Allardyce has welcomed any retrospective punishment, saying that the Australian midfielder deserves a ban for acting in a dangerous manner against the Senegal striker. He added: 'Jedinak was clearly in a position where Mike Dean couldn't see it. I think about how dangerous it was. It was a very dangerous thing he did. He could have seriously injured Sakho. And he will have to take the punishment \u2013 because I think he deserves it.' Mile Jedinak has been charged by the FA with violent conduct after catching Diafra Sakho with his elbow . The incident went unpunished during the game but Jedinak was retrospectively charged . Elsewhere, in his pre-match press conference, ahead of the visit of Chelsea to East London tomorrow night, Allardyce spoke about the chats he enjoyed with Dave Mackay, the former Tottenham, Derby, Hearts and Scotland enforcer, who died aged 80. Allardyce said: 'I knew Dave. He lived in around Nottingham, when I was at Notts County for three years (1997-1999). I spent many a good night with him talking away about his time in football, about management. 'It's a sad day. He was a terrific guy not just a terrific a footballer. In life, you take a lot of things from a lot of people. 'If you want to get better, you don't just read a book or do a Masters' degree at university; you learn a lot from listening to the experiences of people who have been great in their own careers.'","highlights":"West Ham were beaten 3-1 by Crystal Palace at Upton Park on Saturday .\nGlenn Murray scored twice for the Visitors before being sent off .\nSam Allardyce is still angry that Murray was not dismissed earlier .\nMile Jedinak elbowed Diafra Sakho and it went unpunished during game .\nMidfielder has since been charged by the FA for violent conduct .\nAllardyce said it was dangerous and Murray deserves punishment ."}
{"article":"Glasgow's chances of hosting Britain\u2019s Davis Cup quarter-final against France appear to be on rise following initial talks with the LTA. Although Andy Murray immediately expressed a desire to play the July tie on a grass court, the fact that neither Wimbledon nor the Queen\u2019s Club will be available is believed to be pushing decision makers towards a return to the Emirates Arena. Andy Murray celebrates extravagantly during his straight sets win over John Isner on Sunday . Great Britain supporters would relish supporting Murray and Co in Glasgow again in July . All three day's of Davis Cup action at the Emirates Arena were sold out in a matter of minutes . The only available outdoor grass arena with a big enough capacity is in Eastbourne - but neither the players nor captain Leon Smith are keen on playing at a venue renowned for a lack of atmosphere. The noise and passion of the Scottish crowd played a huge part in the weekend win over the USA, sparking a debate within the LTA over whether that X factor may outweigh any disadvantage that comes from not playing on grass. While Murray prefers it to the indoor hard court, he would be favourite to beat any of his French opponents on any surface \u2013 while British No 2 James Ward is actually better when he moves on to the artificial surface, potentially the decisive factor when the final call is made. GB captain Leon Smith doubts the chances of Glasgow being able to create a larger grass-court venue . Smith embraces with \u00a0Murray after the latter's straight sets win secured GB's quarter-final berth . Murray (middle) is looked on in envy by his fellow GB team-mates after securing a tie against France . Sportsmail understands that the city authorities are willing to leave the July 17-19 dates clear in the hope of getting the nod over the coming week or so. Unfortunately, because it takes about a week to set up the court, a Bette Midler concert would rule out taking the quarter-final to The Hydro, the city\u2019s biggest indoor venue. But a return to the Emirates, which hosted over 21,000 fans over three days, is very much on the cards. Although no one from Glasgow Life would comment on their plans yesterday, a spokesman said: \u2018The atmosphere at the weekend was electric and Glasgow proved, once again, why we are one of the world\u2019s top sporting cities. Any decision on hosting future Davis Cup ties would be for the LTA.\u2019","highlights":"Great Britain face France in the Davis Cup quarter finals in July .\nThis tie could be held in Glasgow if GB decide atmosphere outweighs the desire to play on a grass court .\nAndy Murray admits his preference is grass, but that playing in Glasgow again with the crowd behind them could be crucial ."}
{"article":"Real Madrid midfielder James Rodriguez has been using an anti-gravity treadmill in a bid to speed up his recovery from the foot injury that has kept him sidelined since the start of last month. The Colombia ace broke the fifth metatarsal in his right foot during the Champions League winners' 2-1 La Liga win against Sevilla at the Bernabeu on February 4. The 23-year-old was expected to be out for around eight weeks but appears on course to make an early return after already taking part in light training sessions with the squad. James Rodriguez steps up recovery from broken foot by using anti-gravity treadmill . James has been out since the start of February after breaking the fifth metatarsal in his right foot . An anti-gravity treadmill is used in rehabilitation to take pressure off the injured part of the body to allow players to train without the risk of aggravating the injury. Now James has taken to Instagram to document the latest phase of his recovery as the \u00a363million man shared a video of him running on an anti-gravity treadmill. James' return will be welcomed by coach Carlo Ancelotti as Real Madrid continue to struggle in La Liga. The Champions League winners have failed to win in their last three games having drawn with Villarreal before being beaten by Athletic Bilbao as Barcelona usurped Real at the top of the league. Los Blancos hit a new low on Tuesday as they were beaten 4-3 at the Bernabeu by Schalke, only just scraping through to the Champions League quarter-finals thanks to their 2-0 win away in the first leg.

{"article":"(CNN)A migrant worker whose life ended in Washington after police shot at him 17 times. A father of four killed by an officer during a traffic stop in Texas. A man killed during a robbery investigation in California. After three Mexican citizens were killed by police in the United States in the past month, Mexico's Foreign Ministry says the U.S. Justice Department should step in. \"Given that these incidents cannot be looked at in isolation, the Mexican government has called for the U.S. Department of Justice through its civil rights division to monitor the investigation of these three cases to assure that they're conducted with transparency and where appropriate, the proper criminal or civil responsibility is determined,\" Mexico's Foreign Ministry said on Monday. The Mexican government's statement comes amid a debate that has surged across the United States about whether police are using excessive force, particularly when they deal with minority groups. \"Adding to our consternation over the third case of a Mexican killed by an excessive use of force in less than one month, is our deep concern for the effect of the break in trust between the Hispanic community and the police forces that could result from these actions,\" the foreign ministry said. Investigators said they're still piecing together information on all three cases. No charges have been filed. Here's a look at what we know so far: . Protesters at a city council meeting in Grapevine, Texas, this week chanted a familiar refrain: \"Hands up! Don't shoot!\" For the demonstrators, the chant -- which started as a call to action after the police shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri -- has become a rallying cry for another case. Police shot 31-year-old Rub\u00e9n Garc\u00eda Villalpando in the Dallas suburb of Euless, Texas, on February 20. Investigators say the case started when a burglar alarm sounded at a business. Villalpando's car, which was in the area, was followed by police in what authorities described as a high-speed chase. Eventually, Villalpando pulled over. Villalpando was unarmed, but in early reports about the shooting, police said an altercation erupted after he disobeyed an officer's commands during a traffic stop. The traffic stop was caught on camera, but police haven't released the dash cam video to the public. \"There will be more information released as the investigation continues. This additional information may shed more light on Mr. Villalpando's actions that night,\" police and city officials said. \"We look forward to the time that the community can review the dash cam video of this incident, which we believe will answer many questions and correct some misconceptions about this incident.\" Villalpando's family said they've seen the video, and even though it doesn't show the officer or the shooting,  they said one thing is clear: Villalpando was unarmed and did nothing to threaten the officer who stopped him. Fernando Romero said it was jarring to hear what his brother-in-law said in the video as he gets out of the vehicle. \"My brother-in-law is out of the car with his hands up,\" Romero said, \"and the first thing he asks is, 'Are you going to kill me?'\" Marta Romero, Villalpando's wife, said her husband made a mistake when he didn't stop when the officer tried to pull him over. But she said he was trying to cooperate and turn himself in. \"He was painted like a criminal who was involved in a robbery and had assaulted an officer, and in the video you don't see any of those things,\" she said. \"You see the opposite, a man who is scared, who is simply trying to calm the situation, who sees that the police officer has a weapon in his hands.\" Police say Ernesto Javier Canepa D\u00edaz, 28, was killed February 27 after a shooting broke out during a robbery investigation. \"At this time we need the process to continue in order to know what happened,\" Santa Ana, California, Police Chief Carlos Rojas told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol. He declined to comment on the investigation, but said Canepa had been arrested in the past for various crimes, including narcotics possession, possessing stolen property, domestic violence and resisting police. When police came across his car last week, he was wanted for a series of robberies, Rojas said. \"He did not cooperate with the police and we know that a police officer shot various times at him and he died at the scene,\" Rojas said. And police, he said, found a replica of a gun inside the car. \"We do not know if this is the reason why the police officer used force. That will be investigated,\" Rojas said. Canepa's family said they don't believe police were justified in opening fire. \"Whatever it was, he did not deserve to die this way,\" said Mayte Canepa, Ernesto's sister. \"He did not deserve for them to shoot at him like they did.\" The Orange County Register reported that at a press conference on Tuesday, Canepa's brother, Andres, described police as \"a gang with a badge.\" The officer who shot Canepa has been suspended with pay until the investigation is finished, police said. A proud laborer from Mexico, Antonio Zambrano-Montes picked fruit in the orchards of Washington state, but when his most valuable tools -- his hands -- became injured last year, he fell into deep despair. He couldn't work or send money to family in Mexico, two routines that shaped his life. It was this misfortune that distressed Zambrano-Montes in the days before he and police in Pasco, Washington, clashed in February, in a confrontation that ended with officers firing 17 bullets, hitting Zambrano-Montes several times and killing him. He was unarmed but was accused of pelting police with rocks. Police have said that Zambrano-Montes, 35, was throwing rocks at cars and trucks when confronted by officers. He then allegedly stoned two officers, and police resorted to deadly force, authorities said. Officers had used a Taser on him, but it wasn't effective, police said. The shooting now haunts his family, due in no small measure to how the hail of police bullets was captured on videos and posted on YouTube by bystanders. Zambrano-Montes' family said his limited English left him unable to understand the officers' commands, shouted in English. His mother, Agapita Montes, said she didn't see her son throwing rocks in the videos. \"The only thing I can see is that he's running, he raises his hands and they still shoot him. Why? I ask myself. Why?\" Montes said. Erlinda Zambrano, an aunt of Zambrano-Montes, also found it very difficult to accept the police version of events, she said. \"We are living with profound pain from how he died, and it's something very bad and terrible,\" the aunt said. \"I look at the videos now and I cannot sleep because it's too hard.\" CNN's Michael Martinez, Gustavo Valdes and Alina Machado contributed to this report.","highlights":"In the past month, three Mexican nationals have been killed in U.S. police shootings .\nMexico's Foreign Ministry says the shootings \"cannot be looked at in isolation\"\nStatement warns of possible \"break in trust between the Hispanic community and police\""}
{"article":"Sam Warburton is set to captain Wales for a record 34th time in the RBS 6 Nations showdown against Ireland in Cardiff on Saturday. Nik Simon talks to Warburton and Wales wing legend Shane Williams about the game which could decide the Six Nations Championship. Nik Simon: You'll become Wales's most-capped captain on Saturday. What's the secret? Sam Warburton:\u00a0I take it with a pinch of salt because there are more games now than 30 years ago. Warren Gatland put his faith in me when I was quite young and he's stuck with me. Before I took up the role, some people said 'If someone's out of line, then you have to give it to them'. Rather than the Roy Keane approach, and as a Spurs fan, I like to compare myself to Ledley King. Sportsmail's Nik Simon speaks to Wales captain Sam Warburton and former Test winger Shane Williams . Warburton (left) is set to captain Wales for a record 34th time against Ireland in Cardiff on Saturday . Former Wales and Lions winger Williams believes his Warburton's side are still in the running for the title . Simon: Ryan Jones previously held the record, how do the two compare? Shane Williams: To be captain, you have to be well liked by the players. Warburton came in at the latter stage of my career and was much younger than me, so it was a little strange to have him as captain. But he impressed me straight away and, like Ryan, he trained hard and played hard. Simon: Wales are still in the running for the championship despite losing to England in round one. Are there shades of 2013? Warburton: It's going that way. Our experience in 2013 has given us the belief that we can do it. It was tough then because all the Wales teams previously had won a Grand Slam. Ryan sat us down and gave us the belief that we needed. We've had our one lifeline but we've got the motivation that it's still possible. Williams: Fate is always in your hands with the Six Nations, that's what makes it special. It's an open championship. Ireland are favourites to win in Cardiff but you can't write anyone off \u2014 one result can change everything. Simon: Jonathan Sexton ran the show against England. How much of a threat is he? Warburton: If I'm being honest, I didn't see the game live because I was watching Tottenham v Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final. I flicked back and forth to see the rugby score. But Johnny is a massive part of the Irish team. His attention to detail impressed me on the Lions tour and he knew every move so intricately. He deserves to be known as one of the best players in the world. Ryan Jones (centre) previously held the record for\u00a0Wales's most-capped captain . Simon: How do you defend against Sexton and Conor Murray's kicking game? Williams: The game is changing and there's a massive focus on rugby league style kicks. When I saw the state of Tommy Bowe at the end last week, he had chased a lot of kicks and was very tired. It helps being six-foot plus when you're taking high balls. Dan Biggar is one of the best in the world at kicking the ball in the air, running 40 yards, and catching it. It sounds easy but it's such a big part of the game now. Simon: Who would you select in the Welsh back-three? Williams: Defensively, Leigh Halfpenny is the best full back in the world. George North is my first-choice winger because he's such a talented footballer. On the other wing I would keep Liam Williams, who's the form player in Wales. Scott Baldwin and Luke Charteris were both very good in the pack against France \u2014 especially with the 100 per cent lineout \u2014 and I wouldn't make any changes for the weekend\u2026 if it isn't broken don't fix it! Fly half Jonathan Sexton (right) has been superb for Ireland during this years's tournament . Simon: Can the Welsh half-backs match the Irish? Williams: I've been very impressed with Biggar and Rhys Webb. They've made those positions theirs at the moment and they are able to take pressure off each other through their time management and kicking games. It helps that they've been together at Ospreys and they will have to be on top of their game against Murray and Sexton, because they're the world's in-form combination. Simon: England were blitzed at the breakdown in Dublin, are you putting extra focus on that area? Warburton: Out of all the Six Nations teams I've played against, Ireland have been the most effective at the breakdown. I've not been rewarded as much at the breakdown as I was last year. I haven't made as many turnovers as I would have liked. The post-tackle stuff is always an add-on after training and Shaun Edwards always barks at us when we're doing it. It's key to our game plan. Simon: Ireland have lost just twice in Cardiff in 32 years, why are they so successful? Williams: In the nicest possible way, they take an arrogant approach and expect to win every game. They've had players like Paul O'Connell, Brian O'Driscoll and Ronan O'Gara, who have been able to win these kind of games. They have belief and mental toughness. When they're playing well, they build up confidence and are a very tough team to stop. Wales head coach Warren Gatland (centre) will be pitting his wits against fellow Kiwi Joe Schmidt this week . Simon: What's the key to countering that record? Warburton: Like every international match, there are three areas: set piece, breakdown, kicking game. If you can come out on top in two of those three then that's probably going to be the key. I think the breakdown and the kicking game will be the two key areas against Ireland. We're back at our own little nest in the Vale and we're back at home. After two wins, confidence is high. Simon: Warren Gatland vs Joe Schmidt will be an interesting coaching battle \u2014 how do the two Kiwis compare? Williams: They both stick to the game plan they want to play. Schmidt uses the players as a tool to work out how Ireland are going to play, rather than trying to fit them into a certain game-plan. Warren Gatland is very similar. Warren's got a great way with people. He gets the best out of his players by taking the mick out of them. I used to come off the field and, with a glint in his eye, he would say 'oh you were rubbish today!'. He loves the wind-up and he loves getting his players going. Schmidt is very straight down the line. He says it as it is and gets the best out of his players by being honest. They're different personalities but they're both hugely successful. Wales winger George North makes a strong carry during his side's victory against France in Paris . Simon: Wales are still in the running\u2026 How much of a World Cup confidence boost would it be to win the Six Nations? Warburton: I don't think the Six Nations will have much bearing on the World Cup. In 2011 that wasn't the case. The Six Nations didn't reflect our World Cup campaign. Last year's autumn campaign finished well for us but that didn't transfer into the first game against England. I don't think there's much of a trend with Wales. The most important period will be the three months we're together in the summer. We'll treat that like a pre-season.

{"article":"(CNN)A Michigan woman lost her Planet Fitness membership over the \"inappropriate\" manner in which she complained about a transgender woman in the locker room, a gym spokeswoman said. Yvette Cormier's membership was not canceled for simply raising the issue, \"as we welcome all feedback from our members,\" said McCall Gosselin, director of public relations at Planet Fitness Corporate. Rather, it was the manner in which she expressed her concerns that club management felt was inappropriate, resulting in the cancellation, Gosselin said. Cormier stands by her actions in a case that has drawn attention to transgender rights. \"This is all new to me. I didn't go out to specifically bash a transgender person that day. I was taken aback by the situation,\" Cormier told CNN. \"This is about me and how I felt unsafe. I should feel safe in there.\" The mother of two says she was acting out of concern for her safety and the privacy of other female gym members when she raised the issue on Saturday, February 28. She went to the front desk after someone who looked like a \"man\" entered the women's locker room while she was changing. \"I wanted to know why there was a man in the women's locker room,\" she told CNN. \"He looked like a man, and that's what stopped me in my tracks.\" She said the front desk employee told her about Planet Fitness' \"no-judgment\" policy, which allows people to use changing room based on \"their sincere, self-reported gender identity.\" Unsatisfied, she said she called Planet Fitness' corporate headquarters and heard the same thing. \"That should be something they pointed out when I signed up,\" she said. \"If you have male parts you don't need to be in the women's locker room. I don't care what you are; I don't care if you're gay lesbian, transgender or transvestite. I am uncomfortable with you as a male in my locker room, in my restroom.\" She returned to the gym Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday \"to get the word out\" to other women that they \"let men in the women's locker room,\" she said. \"Every day I said 'just so you know, there's a man they allow in this locker room and they don't tell you that when you sign up,' \" she said. The next day, she found out that her membership had been canceled. Cormier said Planet Fitness needs to do a better job of informing members of its policy allowing members to use whichever locker room corresponds with their gender identity, which refers to a person's psychological identification as a man, woman or another gender. \"The manner in which this member expressed her concerns about the policy exhibited behavior that management at the Midland club deemed inappropriate and disruptive to other members, which is a violation of the membership agreement and as a result her membership was canceled,\" Gosselin said in a statement on behalf of Planet Fitness. \"Planet Fitness is committed to creating a nonintimidating, welcoming environment for our members. Our gender identity nondiscrimination policy states that members and guests may use all gym facilities based on their sincere self-reported gender identity.\" LGBT advocates applauded the Planet Fitness policy, saying it was necessary to ensuring the safety and privacy of transgender individuals. Planet Fitness has the right to allow members to use whichever locker room corresponds with their gender identity, Alison Gill, senior legislative council for the Human Rights Campaign, told MLive. Even though gender identity is not a protected class under Michigan anti-discrimination laws, transgender individuals still have the right to use whichever bathroom they feel comfortable using, attorney Jay Kaplan with the ACLU of Michigan's LGBT Project told MLive. \"A transgender woman would be much more at risk for her safety if she had to use the men's bathroom,\" he said. Cormier does not see it that way. But she agrees with LGBT advocates on one potential solution: unisex, single-stall bathrooms.","highlights":"Woman loses gym membership after complaining about transgender woman in locker room .\nPlanet Fitness said manner in which she expressed concerns was \"inappropriate\"\nYvette Cormier: \"This is all new to me\""}

{"article":"Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana believes captaincy is bringing the best out of team-mate Jordan Henderson. In the absence of Steven Gerrard, who returned to training this week after a hamstring injury which has sidelined him for six matches, the Reds vice-captain has taken the armband and led from the front. His goal against Burnley was his second in as many games - taking his tally for the season to five - and he also provided his 11th assist of the season for Daniel Sturridge to also score against the Clarets. Jordan Henderson (centre) has seen Liverpool unbeaten in his six games as captain . Henderson scored a stunning goal in the 2-0 victory over Burnley on Wednesday . The England international also scored a screamer against champions Manchester City in his previous game . Liverpool have not lost any of the 13 matches in which Henderson has worn the armband from the start and Lallana, who knows something about leadership from his time at Southampton, believes his England colleague has grown with the added responsibility. 'He is unbelievable. He has matured as a player over the last two seasons and he has kicked on another level even with the armband,' said the \u00a323million summer signing. 'I was lucky enough to be captain at Southampton and it does give you that little bit extra and it seems it is doing the same to him. 'It is great to be playing with such good players and the results are on the up. 'We have a great rhythm and a good bit of consistency and are keeping clean sheets as well; we've turned a corner since Christmas and we are really looking good. Adam Lallana (centre) believes Henderson has come into his own after being handed the Reds armband . First choice captain Steven Gerrard (right) has returned to training after recovering from a hamstring injury . 'It was a difficult start (to the season) but all the signings have bedded in now and we have players back fit and we have found a system we are playing really well and are causing teams problems. 'Confidence is a big thing in any team and we have that in abundance and I think it is showing.' Lallana's own improvement in form has also taken an upturn in line with the team's and there is no doubt he is benefiting from the 3-4-2-1 system which allows him the freedom, alongside Philippe Coutinho, to exploit the space behind the central striker. 'I've had a few injuries and been in and out of the team for whatever reason but I am thoroughly enjoying it at the minute,' he added. 'I am staying fit and contributing in the system the manager has got us playing.' Daniel Sturridge scores against Palace to set up an FA Cup quarter-final against Blackburn on Sunday . With Liverpool now at full pelt in the race for the top four, just three points behind third-placed Arsenal, they must now divert their attention to the FA Cup. Sky Bet Championship side Blackburn visit Anfield on Sunday with a place in the last four at stake. 'It is a great competition in which we have a great chance of getting to Wembley in the semi-final,' said Lallana. 'We won't underestimate Blackburn, we will dust ourselves down, recover well and go again Sunday. 'A lot of the big guns went out in the early rounds so it is good that we can maybe capitalise on that but Blackburn will not be an easy game. 'They will come here full of optimism and will want to cause an upset.'","highlights":"Jordan Henderson has captained Reds in absence of Steven Gerrard .\nLiverpool remain unbeaten in the six matches under Henderson .\nAdam Lallana reckons England team-mate has matured with the armband .\nREAD: Henderson can be Liverpool's new Gerrard .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Liverpool news ."}
{"article":"Ireland clung on to claim a controversial five-run win over Zimbabwe to keep their bid to reach the World Cup quarter-finals on track. Ed Joyce's third one-day international century helped Ireland post 331 for eight - their highest ever score at a World Cup - but Zimbabwe looked like running down the record chase until a debatable John Mooney catch. Replays appeared to show Mooney had stepped on the rope when he held on to remove Sean Williams, who was four short of a century and seemingly in control of the pursuit. Alex Cusack (centre) of Ireland is congratulated by team mates after getting the wicket of Tawanda Mupariwa . Kevin O'Brien celebrates after Sean Williams is controversially caught out by John Mooney . Ireland celebrate after winning their pulsating World Cup clash against Zimbabwe and knocking them out . The third umpire was called to judge the catch, although Williams did not remain on the field of play after he instead opted to take the word of Mooney that he had taken the catch inside the rope. There was still drama to follow as number 10 Tawanda Mupariwa slapped 19 from the penultimate over, delivered by Kevin O'Brien, to leave Zimbabwe needing seven from the last six balls. But Alex Cusack held his nerve as he claimed the final two wickets, first getting Regis Chakabva to drag on before Mupariwa skied a catch William Porterfield gratefully accepted. While Joyce's 112 earned him the man-of-the-match award Cusack's four for 32 was just as invaluable, especially after he removed Zimbabwe skipper Brendon Taylor for 121. Ed Joyce celebrates making his third one-day international century and helping Ireland to 331-8 . Joyce scores many of his impressive runs as Ireland boosted their chances of World Cup qualification . Victory was Ireland's second over a full-member nation at the tournament after they opened their campaign with a win over West Indies. They will, however, most likely need to pull off one more shock in their final two pool games against India and Pakistan. Pakistan's surprise win over South Africa earlier in the day did Ireland few favours and their clash in Adelaide on March 15 looms as a potential decider. John Mooney celebrates getting the wicket of Sikandar Raza and helping them on their way to victory . Ireland stand for the national anthem during the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup against Zimbabwe . Joyce became the fourth Ireland player to score a World Cup century although he was given a helping hand by a sloppy Zimbabwe fielding display. The Sussex batsman was twice dropped, while he edged his first ball just short of slip, but was otherwise imperious as he hit nine fours and three sixes. He joined in a third-wicket partnership of 138 with Andy Balbirnie, who was only three runs away from following Joyce to three figures after he was run out during the late-over scramble. Ireland took 108 from the final 10 overs to reach their highest ODI score, surpassing the 329 for seven they racked up during their famous World Cup win over England in Bangalore four years ago. Kevin O'Brien celebrates after taking the controversial wicket of  Zimbabwe batsman Sean Williams . Williams reacts after getting out at the Bellerive Oval ground despite it looking like Mooney touched the foam . When Zimbabwe then crashed to 74 for four in reply Ireland were in total control only for Taylor and Williams to turn the momentum of the match in a 149-run stand. Taylor reached his century from 79 balls and Ireland's attack was looking toothless until Cusack produced a slower ball to fool the Zimbabwe skipper into spooning a catch to mid-on. Williams kept the scoreboard ticking over and had reduced the task to a manageable 32 from 20 balls when Mooney's controversial catch was claimed. It was a critical moment and while Mupariwa made Ireland sweat, as he hit Kevin O'Brien for back-to-back fours and then a six, Cusack cleaned up the tail in a thrilling finale. The Irish players congratulate each other after their final over victory over the African country .","highlights":"Ireland beat Zimbabwe by five runs after exciting tie came down to final over but the game was also\u00a0surrounded\u00a0by a controversial wicket .\nJohn Mooney appeared to touch the foam as he caught Sean Williams out .\nEd Joyce scored his third one-day international century .\nClick here for all the latest Cricket World Cup news ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Retired NFL star Darren Sharper changed course and pleaded guilty Monday to one count of sexual assault and one count of attempted sexual assault. Sharper has been in jail in Los Angeles since last year, but this case was in Arizona. Sharper and his attorney had a telephone meeting with Judge Warren Granville, where the former player and television analyst changed his plea. The judge sentenced Sharper to nine years in prison with no eligibility for early release, Maricopa County Attorney's Office spokesman Jerry Cobb said. Sharper will also be placed on lifetime probation afterward. Sharper, a five-time Pro Bowl player, originally faced five counts of drugging and raping three women in Scottsdale, Arizona, in November 2013. Before being indicted in Arizona, Sharper was arrested in California on charges of drugging and raping two women in that state. He was also under investigation in other states. Florida prosecutors announced last year they would not prosecute Sharper on similar allegations, but he faces federal charges in Louisiana. Sharper played for the Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints from 1997 through the 2010 season. The five-time Pro Bowl player intercepted 63 passes in his career, tying for seventh all-time. He is tied for second all-time in interceptions returned for touchdowns with 11, according to Pro-Football-Reference.com. He later worked as an analyst for NFL Network. Sharper will get about 300 days credit for time already served in California, Cobb said.

{"article":"Babylon, Iraq (CNN)ISIS has smashed priceless ancient statues in Mosul, bulldozed the ruins of Nineveh and Hatra, and dynamited centuries-old churches, mosques and shrines. In a battle between Iraqi forces and ISIS over control of Tikrit recently, the tomb of Saddam Hussein was squashed to rubble, though it's not clear which side did it. Luckily, the ancient city of Babylon is outside the extremists' grasp, south of Baghdad. For nearly 5,000 years it has stood as a symbol of the glory of ancient Mesopotamian civilization. Saddam Hussein renovated the ruins in the 1980s, leaving his own crude personal stamp on the bricks there. They bear his name and describe him as the son of Nebuchadnezzar, who had the reputation of being ancient Babylon's greatest king. One of Hussein's former palaces still peers down over the city. But it continues to be source of great pride for Iraqis who see themselves as the heirs of the world's oldest civilization. And many Iraqis know better than to buy the claims of their deposed despot. \"This wasn't Saddam's,\" said Adnan Abu Fatima. \"It belonged to our grandfathers, the Babylonians.\" Abu Fatima strolled through the ruins with his family. Saddam's vain brick inscriptions may annoy him, but ISIS' destruction appalls him. \"The Mosul museum was destroyed. Why?\" he wants to know from ISIS. \"That is the heritage of your grandfathers. Why did you do that?\" The defacers' reasoning? The artifacts, some of the oldest in ancient civilization, are from the \"age of ignorance,\" ISIS says, before the advent of Islam. Antiquity is an integral part of Iraq's national identity. History is measured there not in centuries but in millennia, and Iraqi's take such vandalism to heart. They've had to watch since the U.S. invasion in 2003 how artifacts have been stolen. Baghdad's museum was plundered, during a lapse in U.S. security, and the priceless artifacts were smuggled around the world. The U.S. State Department has announced it will return more than 60 items on Monday, which had been sneaked into the United States. Safa ad-Din Hassan and other parents took Iraqi scouts on a camping trip near Babylon to teach them about their history and make ancient artwork with them. Hassan fled Mosul when ISIS overran it last year then later ransacked the museum. \"When I saw what happened, I was determined to come her to preserve our antiquities from ISIS,\" he said. Iraq will defend its heritage against ISIS, said Mohamed Hattab from Iraq's Antiquities Department. \"Babylon is our soul.\" It's a soul under assault by latter day barbarians, who have destroyed much of it in the North, which has been out of the defensive reach of Iraqi soldiers. The military has started a drive to retake Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit from the extremists. After the rage of a battle subsided, they moved in to the outskirt town of Awja to find the former dictator's tomb flattened. Video of soldiers standing on top of it was posted to YouTube. They celebrated the posthumous slap against their former tormentor. One man fired shots into the rubble toward Hussein's grave site. It was a piece of history they were glad to part with. CNN's Ben Wedeman reported and wrote from Babylon, and Ben Brumfield reported and wrote from Atlanta.

{"article":"A group of college footballers have sparked outrage by dressing in Ku Klux Klan robes in a parody of the Will Smith movie Bad Boys II. About 20 members of the team, at Wheaton College near Chicago, Illinois, performed the 'skit' wearing Klan-style white hoods and carrying Confederate flags. The off-season team-building exercise was intended as a 'satirical parody' of the 2003 action comedy Bad Boys II, starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, whose characters poke fun at the KKK. Footballers performed a 'skit' wearing Klan-style white hoods during a team-building exercise at\u00a0Wheaton College (pictured) near Chicago . The skit, intended as a parody of a scene from the Will Smith movie Bad Boys II (pictured), has sparked outrage on campus . But the stunt has provoked anger on the campus while Philip Ryken, the evangelical Christian college's president, has sent an email to all students and staff. The incident happened on February 28 in a campus gym and involved some of the team's black players. College bosses have acknowledged the skit was 'racially insensitive'. In Bad Boys II, the police detectives played by Smith and Lawrence burst out of white robes they are wearing as part of a raid on a Ku Klux Klan meeting. According to the Chicago Tribune, team Captain Josh Aldrin, who is African-American, took responsibility for the skit and, in a letter to students, admitted 'we made a mistake.' The incident happened on February 28 in a campus gym and involved some of the team's black players . In Bad Boys II, the police detectives played by Smith and Martin Lawrence (pictured) burst out of white robes they are wearing as part of a raid on a Ku Klux Klan meeting . He wrote: 'As a black male, a team captain, and the leader of the group that performed the skit, I should have understood that (the) KKK and Confederate symbols are not funny in any context. 'We hope the campus community will forgive us for our actions.' Mr Ryken was made aware of the incident shortly after it happened and held a meeting with some of those involved at 1am the next morning. On Sunday, more than 700 students gathered in the College's Pierce Chapel to pray for 'campus-wide healing'. In a statement posted on its website, the college said: 'The team captain acknowledged his poor judgment in failing to consider the inherently hurtful meanings these symbols carry, though it was clear the skit was not motivated by racial hostility. 'The coaches accepted responsibility for their failure to provide appropriate guidance. 'All recognized that, regardless of the group's intent, the skit was inappropriate, and apologized in an e-mail to the campus community sent out around noon on Sunday.' Footage was taken of the event - but the images were 'inherently hurtful and shocking' and would not be disseminated, the college said. The statement added: 'Wheaton College stands resolutely against racial insensitivity, including the use of symbols that convey hatred against African Americans and other ethnic minorities. 'The College is committed to responding promptly and appropriately to incidents that may violate our Community Covenant, taking the time to consider the total facts of each situation and seeking redemption, with respect for the dignity of each person.'","highlights":"Players at Wheaton College near Chicago wore KKK hoods as part of 'skit'\nAbout 20 footballers took part in a 'satirical parody' of 2003's Bad Boys II .\nEvent was part of a team-building exercise at evangelical Christian college .\nMovie scene involves Will Smith and Martin Lawrence raiding KKK meeting .\nCollege bosses have acknowledged that the skit was 'racially insensitive'"}
{"article":"(CNN)Lily wasn't moving when rescuers found her, hanging upside down in her mother's smashed car. It had flipped over into a frigid Utah river half a day before, and the baby was still strapped in her seat. As Officer Jared Warner dashed with the 18-month-old in his arms to an ambulance, she was barely alive. But she's doing better, her family said Monday. \"Her improvement is astounding. Right now she's watching 'Dora (the Explorer)' and singing '(The) Wheels on the Bus' with Grandpa. She is smiling and laughing for family members. We're blown away by Lily's progress and so grateful to her rescuers,\" they said. Lily's mother, Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck, died in the crash that had landed their car on its roof in the Spanish Fork River. She was 25 years old. Lily might have died unseen with her mother, had a man not gone fishing in that particular spot Saturday. The angler waded into the river around noon, then noticed the car wheels-up in the water. \"Where the car was, you couldn't see it from the roadway,\" police Lt. Cory Slaymaker said. The fisherman called emergency dispatch. Police and fire rescuers arrived and sprang into the water. The rest of what happened is now a frenetic blur for Officer Bryan DeWitt. \"I don't remember doing anything but just doing it,\" he said. The water was so cold that, when the rescue was over, seven of the men involved had to be treated for hypothermia. They heaved the car onto its side and saw Groesbeck in the driver's seat. It was clear to them that she was dead. Then they noticed the baby. \"She was definitely unconscious and not responsive,\" Warner said. But she was still alive, and rescuers were delighted to see it. She was still strapped into her seat, where she may have been for 14 hours, if the wreck occurred when police believe it did. The night before, a man living nearby heard a loud crash and stepped outside to check, but he saw nothing unusual, police said, and dismissed it. That was at about 10:30 p.m. on Friday. Groesbeck's car had probably just struck a bridge embankment. \"The driver's side tire went up the cement barrier on the south end of the bridge, launching this woman and her baby into the freezing water,\" Slaymaker told CNN affiliate KUTV. The angler came along around 12:30 p.m. on Saturday, 14 hours later. Groesbeck's death is tragic, but the survival of baby Lily is a story filled with hope. But just how did the baby survive the ordeal? Above all, said CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen, the biggest factor was the car seat. Lily was in the proper car seat and the seat appears to have been properly attached, Cohen said. Even though the child was trapped and upside down, her body remained in the seat and above the frigid water. Doctors say that such low temperatures are dangerous, but would be even more so if the baby were wet. Dry cold temperatures are more survivable than wet cold temperatures, Cohen said. Another factor may have been that the girl, as a toddler, has baby fat. If she had been an infant, it might have been a different story, Cohen said. It's a reminder that the human body is tough. Lily apparently survived for 14 hours in extreme cold, without food or drink. A mystery arose from the rescue: The police officers who entered the water say they heard a voice calling for help. The mother was dead, but the officers said that they heard an adult's voice calling to them. \"The four of us heard a distinct voice coming from the car,\" Warner told CNN. \"To me, it didn't sound like a child's voice.\" The voice gave the rescuers a surge of adrenaline needed to push the vehicle upright, he said. The mother was dead. The child was unconscious, but her eyelids were fluttering, and the rescuers knew she was alive, Warner said. It's one of those things that doesn't have an explanation, he said about the voice. \"It felt like I could hear someone telling me, 'I need help,'\" DeWitt told CNN affiliate KSL. \"It was very surreal, something that I felt like I could hear.\" Tyler Beddoes, a third officer at the scene, said the same. \"All I know is that it was there, we all heard it, and that just helped us to push us harder, like I say, and do what we could to rescue anyone inside the car,\" he told CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360.\" The river is 10 feet deep in some places, police said, but the car hit a shallower spot. Images showed it only partly covered by water. Lily was not submerged, said Police Lt. Matt Johnson. Firefighter Paul Tomadakis freed her from the wreck. He \"grabbed the baby in my arm, raised its head up out of water, as I tried to release the seat belt,\" he said. Then Warner took Lily into his arms. \"The child was passed to me and I ran up and climbed into the ambulance with the child,\" he said. Police have no explanation for the wreck. No alcohol or drugs were in play, they told KUTV. There were no skid marks leading up to the impact. A tow truck hauled Groesbeck's car out of the river, and it will be inspected for possible mechanical failures. Groesbeck's family has set up a gofundme page for donations to help with medical expenses for Lily, and funeral costs for her mother. Late Monday, it had reached more than $35,500, surpassing its goal of $8,000. CNN's Melanie Whitley, Vivien Kuo, Elizabeth Cohen, Joe Sutton Jackie Castillo and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","highlights":"Family says Lily is awake -- smiling, laughing and singing with her grandfather .\nShe was unresponsive when Officer Jared Warner rushed her into an ambulance .\nThe baby girl may have been trapped in the car in the cold river for about 14 hours ."}

{"article":"(CNN)After months racing not only to treat Ebola but to find ways to prevent it, health authorities will launch a vaccination campaign Saturday in one of the areas that has been most devastated by the disease. The trial, using vaccines developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada, will be administered in Basse Guinee, a region that has had the highest number of Ebola cases in Guinea. Another vaccine will be tested in a subsequent study, according to a press release from the World Health Organization, Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders), and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. \"We have worked hard to reach this point,\" WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan said. \"... If a vaccine is found effective, it will be the first preventive tool against Ebola in history.\" Patient Zero -- i.e. the first case in the current Ebola outbreak -- is thought to be a 2-year-old Guinean boy who contracted the virus in December 2013 and died a few days later. Since then, the vast majority of the more than 23,900 cases and more than 9,800 deaths reported by WHO have come in Guinea and neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone. There are new Ebola cases every day, including 132 in the last week of February (which is up from 99 reported the previous week). While Liberia didn't have any of these new incidences, Guinea did -- especially in Forecariah and Conakry. Still, authorities in Africa and their partners around the world have had significant successes generally in combating the deadly disease. The progress -- as measured in the rate of new cases, with January's incidences being the lowest in seven months -- has been so significant that health authorities' focus has shifted from slowing the spread to ending the epidemic. This positive movement has come as a result of steps like better disease control, public awareness campaigns and attention to burial practices. But the tool that has been used to eradicate many other contagious diseases -- vaccines -- has been elusive. That's why, over the past six months, WHO has been working with scientists, ethicists and policymakers to try to create both better treatment therapies and a vaccine that will stop people for getting Ebola in the first place. Health workers in the Guinea trial will start with a new Ebola case and then trace all of that patient's contacts, giving each of them the option of getting vaccinated. John-Arne Rottingen, from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, said this program is happening at the request of Guinean authorities and called the participation of residents there \"vital\" to its success. \"The Ebola epidemic shows signs of receding but we cannot let our guard down until we reach zero cases,\" WHO official Marie-Paule Kieny said. \"An effective vaccine to control current flare-ups could be the game-changer to finally end this epidemic and an insurance policy for any future ones.\"","highlights":"WHO leader: This vaccine could be \"the first preventive tool against Ebola in history\"\nThis trial campaign will be conducted in a hard-hit region of the West African nation of Guinea .\nAuthorities have had success in curbing Ebola, but dozens of new cases still arise each week ."}

Wolves made two changes as Scott Golbourne and Nouha Dicko replaced Kortney Hause and Henry, while Stevie May returned for Wednesday along with Maghoma and Marnick Vermijl. And the visitors threatened first as Atdhe Nuhiu and Tom Lees headed wide before Wolves took the lead in controversial fashion after 19 minutes. Dicko burst down the right and skipped past one sloppy Wednesday tackle but then went down under a soft challenge from Claude Dielna in the area and referee Simon Hooper gave a penalty. The forward looked to have fallen easily but Sako sent Keiren Westwood the wrong way from the spot for his 12th goal of the season. James Henry runs to the crowd after finishing off the scoring with a stunning effort after 67 minutes . Maghoma fired at Kuszczak as the visitors tried to respond before Westwood saved well after Kevin McDonald squeezed in behind the Wednesday defence. And the keeper had to be at his best again on 31 minutes when he turned Dicko's 20-yard effort wide. A minute later and Jack Price shot straight at Westwood as Wednesday were once again opened up, this time by the lively Rajiv van La Parra. The winger fired home from the edge of the area and gave Kieran Westwood no chance of saving it . But Kuszczak kept Wolves ahead 10 minutes before the break when he clawed away Maghoma's header. The Wednesday striker had been their biggest threat and he shot just wide after the restart before Nuhiu headed over. Wolves' slow start gave the visitors encouragement but the hosts doubled their lead out of nothing on 55 minutes. Sako (centre) was a danger throughout and scored the opener from the spot but could have had more . Matt Doherty wriggled free on the right and crossed for the unmarked Afobe to thump a volley in off the post from 12 yards. With that Wednesday crumbled and Henry made it 3-0 12 minutes later with a classy strike when he cut inside and curled into the top corner from 20 yards. It was game over but Wolves suffered a blow when Richard Stearman was carried off on a stretcher with 16 minutes left after appearing to go down under little pressure to dampen their night.","highlights":"Wolves are three points off the play-off places with eight games remaining .\nBakary Sako gave the home side the lead from the penalty spot .\nBenik Afobe and Karl Henry completed the rout in the second half ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Pleading innocence, immunity and ignorance, the city of Cleveland responded to a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Tamir Rice's family by saying the 12-year-old's death was his own fault. In November, Cleveland Officer Timothy Loehmann fired the fatal shots at Tamir within two seconds of arriving outside a recreation center where the sixth-grader was playing with a pellet gun. In the 41-page response to the family's lawsuit filed Friday, the city says that Tamir's injuries \"were directly and proximately caused by the failure of Plaintiffs' decedent to exercise due care to avoid injury.\" The response further says that \"Plaintiffs' decedent's injuries, losses, and damages complained of, were directly and proximately caused by the acts of Plaintiffs' decedent, not this Defendant.\" The city also claims it is entitled to all \"full and qualified\" immunities under state and federal law. As to the scores of other allegations in the lawsuit, the city responds by saying that they are untrue, that the independent investigation by Cuyahoga County is still going on, or that the city \"is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth.\" Cuyahoga County's medical examiner has ruled the death a homicide but has issued no determination as to whether the events that caused the boy's death constitute a crime. Cleveland authorities have repeatedly said that Loehmann mistook Tamir's fake gun for a real one. A witness called 911 on November 22 to say there was \"a guy with a pistol\" and that although the weapon was \"probably\" fake, Tamir was scaring people. It doesn't appear the dispatcher relayed the information to Loehmann and Officer Frank Garmback. Video of the incident shows the two pull up on the snowy grass near a gazebo where Tamir is standing. Within two seconds of exiting the police car, Loehmann shoots the 12-year-old. The boy died the next day of injuries to \"a major vessel, intestines and pelvis.\" In the video, neither Loehmann nor Garmback appears to provide medical assistance to the boy, and Police Chief Calvin Williams has said that Tamir did not receive first aid until an FBI agent arrived on the scene four minutes later. An attorney for the Rice family says the city's response to the lawsuit is indicative of well-documented problems within the Cleveland Police Department. \"The Rice family maintains that Tamir was shot and killed unnecessarily by Cleveland police officers,\" Rice family co-counsel Walter Madison said in a statement. \"Their tactics that preceded his death and the subsequent victim blaming are examples of the institutionalized behavior that has beset the Cleveland Police Department. The Rice family's lawsuit seeks to eliminate certain institutional behaviors and practices that have no place in our diverse community.\" Rice family co-counsel Benjamin Crump said the family was \"just in disbelief\" after reading the response. Crump went on to attack the police department's assertion, put forth in December, that Loehmann gave Tamir three verbal commands to put his hands up. \"It is just incredible that the police officer, based on what we see on the video surveillance recording, gave Tamir three verbal commands to put his hands up and drop the weapon, based on what we see in the video. It was less than 1.7 seconds. The car hadn't even stopped. It's unbelievable.\" CNN could not immediately reach the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Department for comment. Cleveland Police Department spokesperson Ali Pillow declined comment and referred questions to a city spokesman, who couldn't be immediately reached. In December, the U.S. Justice Department released the results of a two-year investigation that found Cleveland officers use guns, Tasers, pepper spray and their fists excessively, unnecessarily or in retaliation. The police force has used unnecessary and unreasonable force at a \"significant rate,\" employing \"dangerous tactics\" that put the community at risk, the investigation stated. It was also reported in December that Loehmann's previous employer, the Independence Police Department in a Cleveland suburb, had numerous complaints about the officer, including that he was \"distracted and weepy\" and \"emotionally immature\" and had demonstrated \"a pattern of lack of maturity, indiscretion and not following instructions.\" He also showed \"dangerous loss of composure during live range training\" and an \"inability to manage personal stress,\" the department said. In December, Crump called for Loehmann and Garmback to be charged and decried what he said was a police tendency to let grand juries determine whether to charge officers involved in shootings. In Tamir's case, he said, \"several things were done inappropriately,\" which is probable cause to charge the officers. \"There is nothing written anywhere in the law that says police officers are to be treated differently from any other citizen,\" Crump said. \"We cannot have children playing cops and robbers on a playground and police officers coming and claiming their lives.\" Loehmann and Garmback have been placed on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation. CNN's Kristina Sgueglia, Catherine E. Shoichet and Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","highlights":"Cleveland: Tamir Rice died because he failed \"to exercise due care to avoid injury\"\nA police officer killed Tamir, 12, last year as the boy played with a pellet gun .\nOfficers mistook fake gun for a real one, Cleveland Police Department has said ."}

{"article":"Moscow (CNN)Russia was ready to put its nuclear forces on alert over the crisis in Crimea last year, such was the threat to Russian people there, President Vladimir Putin said in a documentary that aired on state TV on Sunday night. Asked if Russia was prepared to bring its nuclear weapons into play, Putin said: \"We were ready to do it. I talked with colleagues and told them that this (Crimea) is our historic territory, Russian people live there, they are in danger, we cannot leave them. \"It wasn't us who committed a coup, it was the nationalists and people with extreme beliefs.\" But this was the worst-case scenario, he added, in the documentary broadcast on state-run channel Rossiya One. \"I don't think this was actually anyone's wish -- to turn it into a world conflict.\" It wasn't known when the interview was originally taped. It aired even as speculation mounted about Putin's health, following an absence of several days from the public stage. He reappeared in public Monday. Russia formally annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula last March, after Ukraine's pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted following street protests that turned bloody. Russia called his ouster a coup by radical Ukrainian nationalists. Before Crimea was formally absorbed by Russia, unidentified armed men had taken control of its administrative buildings and key military sites. A referendum was held on March 16, 2014 -- a year ago to the day -- on secession from Ukraine. Ukrainian officials at the time denied there was any threat to Russian citizens in Crimea. On Monday, Russia's Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said Putin had ordered Russia's Northern Fleet and other military units to be placed on full combat alert for snap checks, state media reported. \"The main aim ... is to evaluate the capabilities of the Northern Fleet to fulfill tasks on ensuring Russia's military security in the Arctic,\" Shoigu is quoted as saying by Russia's Tass news agency. The exercise will involve 38,000 military personnel, 41 warships, 15 submarines and 110 planes and helicopters, Shoigu said, according to Tass. In the documentary, titled \"Crimea: Way Back Home,\" Putin said Moscow had had no choice but to act. \"Crimea isn't just any territory for us, it is historically Russian territory,\" he said. Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula that has been part of Ukraine since 1954, has a majority Russian population and strong cultural and historical ties to Russia. It is also home to Russia's Black Sea fleet, at the Sevastopol naval base. But Putin said he had never thought of \"dismembering\" the peninsula from Ukraine until Yanukovych's ouster. \"We cannot leave this area and the people who live there to whims of fate, to let the people of Crimea be thrown under the wheels of this nationalist bulldozer,\" he said. \"I set certain tasks. I did say what and how we should do, but immediately stressed that we would do so only if we are absolutely convinced that the people who live in the Crimea want it.\" The vast majority of people who voted in the referendum approved secession from Ukraine. But the vote, staged while armed men controlled the region, was dismissed as illegal by Ukraine's then-interim government in Kiev, the European Union and the United States. The West responded with financial sanctions against selected Russian figures and Crimean secessionist leaders. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, meeting with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in Berlin on Monday, reiterated that Europe does not consider Russia's annexation of Crimea to be legal. \"It is important that we work for a peaceful solution, and we will not give up before the full sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine has been restored,\" she said. \"This not only includes Crimea but also now in our daily work the areas around Luhansk and Donetsk.\" Unrest broke out in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions following Russia's absorbing of Crimea. A fragile truce is currently in place but the conflict between pro-Russia separatists and Ukrainian forces there has claimed thousands of lives. Merkel warned that the European Union was ready to impose more sanctions if necessary against Russian interests to help ensure that a peace plan hammered out in Minsk, Belarus, last month is fully implemented. Putin told the documentary-makers he was certain the United States was behind the ouster of Yanukovych, which Moscow views as an illegal armed coup. \"Formally, the opposition was primarily supported by Europeans, but we knew very well ... that the real puppeteers were our American partners and friends. It was them who helped prepare nationalists (and) combat troops,\" he said. He also said that sanctions should have been imposed against those who orchestrated what he called a coup, rather than those involved in Crimea's annexation. Putin insisted in remarks to reporters last month that there was no chance Crimea would be returned to Ukraine. And it appears Russia is taking no chances. In the documentary, Putin said Russia's Bastion high-precision coastal missile defense systems had been deployed to Crimea to protect the territory -- \"in such a way that they were seen perfectly well from outer space.\" This can only be done following a decision by the supreme commander in chief, he said. \"So, at a certain point, we deployed these coastal systems Bastion to make it clear that Crimea was under safe protection,\" he added. CNN's Alla Eshchenko and Emma Burrows reported from Moscow, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.","highlights":"Russian President Vladimir Putin was interviewed for a documentary on Crimea shown on Russian state TV .\nAsked if Russia had been prepared to bring its nuclear weapons into play, Putin said: \"We were ready to do it\""}

{"article":"(CNN)In an unusual turn of events last week, a terror plot suspect's desire to talk to local media put him at odds with his attorneys and landed a Cincinnati television station in federal court. At issue was a taped audio interview with Christopher Cornell and whether the station could broadcast that interview. Cornell is accused of plotting to attack the U.S. Capitol. The 20-year-old  -- who claims in the interview that he is affiliated with ISIS -- was arrested on January 14, months after his social media habits and talk of jihad put him on the FBI's radar, according to court documents obtained by CNN at the time of his arrest. Two days after his arrest, a court order was issued barring public contact with Cornell, who is being held at the Boone County Jail across the river in Kentucky. Last week, Cornell made a collect call to CNN affiliate WXIX, said news director Kevin Roach. That phone call initiated what ended up being an hourlong interview, Roach said. Cornell's attorney, Richard Smith-Monahan, argued that WXIX was in contempt of court for violating a January order \"directing the detention facility holding the Defendant not to permit outside contact by anyone with the Defendant without [defense counsel's] express approval.\" Cornell spoke with reporter Tricia Macke. In that interview, he refuses to tell Macke how or when he first came in contact with ISIS, but he did give the reporter details on a plot to kill President Barack Obama, members of Congress, as well as an attack on the Israeli Embassy in Washington. \"I would have took my gun,\" he said.  \"I would have put it to Obama's head.  I would have pulled the trigger.  Then I would unleash more bullets on the Senate and House of Representative members.  And I would have attacked the Israeli Embassy and various other buildings full of Kafir who want to wage war against us Muslims.\" When Macke asked him why he would plot such an attack, he said \"Obama is an enemy of Allah, therefore an enemy of us, of Islamic State.\"  He said his plan for an attack on the U.S. Capitol was retaliation for \"the continued American aggression against our people and the fact that America, specifically President Obama, wants to wage war against Islamic State.\" Cornell told Macke he was planning what would have been a \"major attack\" to take place in Washington on September 20, repeatedly referring to himself as a member of ISIS.  \"I'm with the Islamic State,\" he said at one point.  \"I have connections with many brothers over there.  We've been corresponding for quite some time now, actually.  The FBI finally caught on this past year.\" Cornell told Macke that he used \"encrypted messaging\" to communicate with ISIS members.  He said they discussed \"how we should wage jihad in America.  We should form our own groups and alliances with the Islamic State,\" he continued. Cornell said he was serious about his plans.  \"I'm very dedicated,\" he told Macke.  \"Like I said, I'm a Muslim.  I'm so dedicated that I risked my life.  That should say a whole lot.\" He also warned that there were others like himself.  \"We are indeed here in America,\" he said.  \"We're in each and every state.  We're here in Ohio.  We're more organized than you think.\" The interview was taped in three 20-minute segments and was recorded by the jail and WXIX. Roach said the jail's taping system only allows for 20 minutes of taping at one time, so each time the recording would stop and the phone call ended, Cornell called the station back to tell his side of the story. CNN listened to the audio recording. During the 6:30 p.m. newscast on Thursday, the station aired a brief clip of the audio recording, previewing a longer story that was to air later that night, in the 10 p.m. newscast. According to Mike Allen, legal analyst and attorney for WXIX, a producer from the station called him about 7:30 Thursday evening; Cornell's attorney had filed a \"show of cause\" order in Cincinnati's federal court and an emergency hearing was scheduled for 8:30 p.m. During that hearing, the judge continued the case for Friday morning and WXIX agreed to delay broadcasting the interview until Friday, pending a decision. In addition to the contempt of court argument, Smith-Monahan was also asking the court to issue a restraining order against the station, an order that would keep the station from broadcasting the interview with Cornell, according to court documents. During the hearing, which lasted five hours, a lieutenant at the Boone County facility testified that one of Cornell's attorneys had given him a phone. In that testimony the lieutenant stated that he reminded the attorney that giving Cornell a phone meant he would be able to call anyone he wanted to, which seemed at odds with the spirit of the January court order. At the end of Friday's hearing, U.S. District Judge Sandra Beckwith ruled that the order prohibiting Cornell from contact with the public was vaguely written and the station was not in violation of the order. Additionally, the judge ruled it would be unconstitutional for the news station to be barred from broadcasting the interview, according to Allen. The judge also stated in court that while Cornell has the right to remain silent, he also has the right to freedom of speech. \"At the end of the day, the judge made the right decision,\" Allen said. CNN on Saturday reached out to Smith-Monahan, Cornell's defense attorney, but so far has received no response. WXIX aired a portion of the interview on Friday night, and plans to broadcast more this week. CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","highlights":"Cincinnati reporter interviews Christopher Cornell on the phone .\nCornell is accused of plotting an attack on the U.S. Capitol .\nCornell claims to have ties to ISIS ."}
{"article":"(CNN)In Washington, we are seeing the re-emergence this year of a phenomenon that many Americans were afraid had gone extinct: real live no-joke bipartisanship. Heavyweights from both parties are attending the March 26 Bipartisan Summit on Criminal Justice Reform. The event is co-produced by Gingrich Productions (on the right) and by my project, #cut50 -- an initiative that aims to safely halve the number of people behind bars within 10 years. Attorney General Eric Holder will be speaking. So will Newt Gingrich, the Republican former House speaker. Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, will be there. So will Democratic strategist and CNN commentator Donna Brazile, a co-host of the summit. Republican power players like former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, will address the gathering by video. So will President Obama. Progressives like myself will rub shoulders with representatives from Koch Industries. Everyone keeps asking me, \"How is this possible?\" I have five words for you: \"Liberty and justice for all.\" The ever-expanding incarceration industry has begun to violate some of the deepest and most sacred principles of BOTH major political parties. Therefore, conservatives, libertarians and liberals have their own objective interests in reform -- and their own values-based incentives to make real changes. For example, the right takes very seriously the concept of \"liberty.\" Conservatives and libertarians want to defend the rights of every individual to pursue his or her dreams. They favor limited government. They hate massive, failed, bloated government bureaucracies that suck up more and more money and get more and more power, no matter how badly they perform. In America today, we have 5% of the world's population -- but we have nearly 25% of the world's incarcerated people. Nearly 1 in 100 American adults is behind bars. One out of every four people locked up anywhere in the world is caged in America's prisons and jails. And most people come out more damaged, more hopeless and less able to thrive than when they went in. (So much for \"corrections\"!) That's the opposite of limited government -- and liberty. On the other hand, progressives like me care passionately about the \"justice for all\" part -- including racial justice and social justice. We are incensed by a system that locks up the poor and racial minorities in numbers that are massive -- and massively disproportionate. We oppose a system that forever tars people as \"felons,\"  deemed permanently unfit for employment or the right to vote, possibly because of one mistake, early in life. When any system violates the principles of both \"liberty\" AND \"justice,\" Americans of all stripes should stand together to change it. That is exactly what is starting to happen. This year, we are seeing the birth of an honest-to-goodness \"Liberty and Justice for All\" coalition. Still struggling to believe me? I was on \"Anderson Cooper 360\" on Monday night to discuss the movement for criminal justice reform. Here is a quote: . \"A lot of kids I grew up with, grammar school, middle school, high school, were in prison. They were the poor kids and they had drug addictions. They had drug problems, they didn't have any money, they got caught, and they got caught in the poverty cycle, and they are at the bottom of society and they can't get out of it. ... People with drug problems, people who have mental illnesses, they probably shouldn't be in the criminal justice system. And people who make mistakes, let's not write them off forever, let's give them a chance to reintegrate and reenter society.\" There is just one catch: I'm not the one who said that. That is a direct quote from Mark Holden, senior vice president of Koch Industries. On practically every other issue, the Koch brothers and I are still fierce opponents. I doubt if we will ever agree on tax policy, campaign finance reform, environmental rules or the Keystone Pipeline, to name a few. But on criminal justice reform, it's different. Mark speaks eloquently about the way the criminal justice system violates the Bill of Rights and criminalizes behaviors that should not result in prison terms. And he is not alone, on the right. Fiscal conservatives decry the money wasted on a system that is too expensive and produces poor results. That's one reason that red-state governors, like Georgia's Nathan Deal, have acted boldly. Leaders with roots on the religious right, including summit co-host Pat Nolan, insist on the Christian value of redemption and second chances for those behind bars. Our values may not always be identical, but they can find common expression in fixing this broken prison system. Progressives and conservatives don't have to trust each other -- or even like each other -- to vote together on this issue. Usually, \"bipartisanship\" is just another word for cheap, political gamesmanship. It is too often invoked by one side, simply to gain advantage and to cloak a more narrow set of interests. But on criminal justice reform, something different is happening. Criminal justice reform is the one place where many Republicans, Democrats and Libertarians actually agree -- and are willing to work together to get something done. Over the last 30 years, both parties helped lead us down the path to mass incarceration. It will take both political parties to reverse course. Perhaps the March 26 Bipartisan Summit will represent the first major bend in the road back toward sanity.","highlights":"Van Jones: America locks up far too many of its citizens, and there's a bipartisan effort to change that .\nHe says President Obama, the Koch brothers, Newt Gingrich, Cory Booker and others agree on it ."}

{"article":"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)Iraqi forces appeared Wednesday to be making progress on the third day of a major offensive intended to push ISIS fighters out of the city of Tikrit. The Iraqi soldiers are reportedly approaching the city from five directions, as they seek to prevent ISIS militants from either escaping from Tikrit or sending in reinforcements to bolster its defense. The operation is part of a wide-scale offensive to retake Tikrit and Salahuddin province ordered by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Sunday. It has highlighted the role played by neighboring Iran in the fight against ISIS, at a time when the United States and five other world powers are negotiating with Tehran on a controversial deal to curb its nuclear program. The semiofficial Iranian FARS news agency reports that Qassim Sulaimani, the commander of the elite Iranian Al-Quds Brigade, is helping oversee the operation to retake Tikrit. Iran has provided advisers, weapons and ammunition to the Iraqi government. According to the Pentagon, there may be Iranians operating heavy artillery and rocket launchers as well. Despite the reported Iranian assistance, the Iraqi forces face no easy task as they seek to advance on Tikrit. Besides the direct threat posed by ISIS fighters, they must also avoid the large numbers of homemade bombs that litter the approaches to the city. Iraq has not asked the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS to provide air cover for the operation to retake Tikrit. ISIS released a number of propaganda images Wednesday, showing several vehicles and dozens of ISIS militants with their weapons, which it said were part of a military reinforcement of Salahuddin province. CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the photographs. How the U.S. and Iran found common interests . Why battle for Tikrit will defeat ISIS . Tikrit fell to ISIS in June of 2014, after the group's capture of Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul. Tikrit is best known to Westerners as the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. ISIS, the radical Sunni militant group, has been on a murderous campaign to establish a caliphate across swaths of Iraq and Syria. On Monday, Iraqi forces approached Tikrit from several fronts, Iraqiya TV reported, engaging with ISIS north of the city at al-Alam and south of the city at al-Dour. The element of surprise probably was not a factor, as reports of Iraqi troops amassing near Tikrit were widely shared. What awaits the Iraqi army is most likely a long, hard slog and not a quick rout. Tikrit is a big city, and the army and its associated militias have had problems recapturing much smaller towns from ISIS. There have been several failed attempts to recapture Tikrit since the second half of 2014. While Iraqi forces have gained some territory in the area, it has generally been under ISIS control for the last eight months or so. Prime Minister al-Abadi, who is also commander in chief of the armed forces, said on Twitter that he would \"oversee the operation to liberate Tikrit\" from ISIS. The joint Iraqi forces fighting to retake Tikrit include Iraqi troops, members of the Shia al-Hashed al-Shaabi militia, members of the Sunni Sons of Salahuddin brigades and other Sunni tribal fighters. The offensive involves around 30,000 fighters in all. Rights group Human Rights Watch on Wednesday urged government forces to protect civilians from revenge attacks by pro-government militias as they fight to retake Tikrit. The rights group said it had documented \"numerous atrocities against Sunni civilians by pro-government militias and security forces\" after they recaptured other towns. Human Rights Watch also warned that ISIS could seek to use civilians as human shields. \"All commanders in Tikrit need to make sure that their forces protect civilians and allow them to flee the combat zone,\" said Joe Stork, the group's deputy Middle East and North Africa director. \"Past fighting raises grave concerns that Tikrit's civilians are at serious risk from both ISIS and government forces, and both sides need to protect civilians from more sectarian slaughter.\" CNN's Ben Wedeman reported from Baghdad and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.

{"article":"(CNN)CNN has learned that the manufacturer of the endoscope involved in two superbug deaths at UCLA never obtained permission to sell the device, according to an official at the Food and Drug Administration. Olympus started selling its TJF-Q180V duodenoscope in 2010, but the FDA didn't notice until late 2013 or early 2014 that the company had never asked for clearance to put it on the market, according to Karen Riley, deputy director of strategy for the FDA's Office of External Affairs. \"Why didn't we notice it? I don't know,\" Riley said. \"Can you imagine a prescription drug getting out on the market that didn't go through the approval process?\" asked Dr. Steven Nissen, the chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, who's testified to Congress about device safety problems. \"Devices need to be regulated more vigorously. This is really disturbing.\" In a statement, Olympus said it didn't think needed the FDA's permission to sell the device, but now at the request of the agency, it has applied for that permission. That application is still pending. Seven hospital patients at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center were infected with the deadly superbug CRE -- also known as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae -- from October to January, according to hospital officials. Two of those patients died. The patients caught CRE after routine endoscopic treatments. Hospital officials believe two medical scopes that still carried the deadly bacteria even after disinfection guidelines were followed were the cause of the superbug outbreak. The medical center has contacted 179 others who had endoscopic procedures between October and January and is offering them home tests to screen for the bacteria. Four other patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles have also been infected with  the superbug linked to a contaminated  duodenoscope, according to a statement released by the hospital. The medical scope was used in all four patients, between August and January 2015. Sixty-four other patients who had a duodenoscope procedure with that particular scope are being informed by mail, \"out of an abundance of caution.\" According to FDA rules, a manufacturer must seek clearance for a new model if it includes changes that \"could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device.\" The TJF-Q180V duodenoscope, used to check out ducts in the gastrointestinal system, includes a modification to the exact part of the device that's been implicated in the superbug outbreaks. With this new model, Olympus sealed up that part of the device, known as the elevator channel, hoping to make it more impervious to infection. \"The company clearly made these modifications to make the device safer, but it seems to be that it wasn't safer,\" Riley said. Last year, at the FDA's request, Olympus applied for permission to sell the scope. That application is still pending. Riley emphasized that duodenoscope procedures can be lifesaving, so the agency doesn't want to take them off the market. \"More than 500,000 of these procedures are done every year in the U.S., and the risk of bacterial transmission is actually really very, very low,\" she said. \"We believe the benefits outweigh the risks.\" In its statement, Olympus wrote: \"The emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms is a challenge to the entire health care community.  Olympus is working with relevant medical societies and our customers in research of this emerging issue and the development of additional safeguards to prevent infection associated with [duodenoscope procedures].\" Riley noted that the other two duodenoscope manufacturers, Pentax and Fujifilm, did apply for and were granted clearance to market models similar to Olympus' TJF-Q180V. Now the FDA is asking all three companies to submit evidence that the scopes can be thoroughly cleaned -- and so far it's not going well. Riley said twice the companies have submitted data that failed to show that cleaning could get rid of 99.9999% of all microbes on the scope -- the FDA's standard for disinfection. \"We're still working with them to get good data,\" she said. Riley said she doesn't know if the FDA will penalize Olympus for selling the device without permission. Diana Zuckerman, a device safety expert, said they should. \"It's like with kids. How do you teach your children to behave if there are no consequences when they misbehave?\" she said.","highlights":"FDA official says Olympus never got permission to sell its endoscope .\nMedical device is connected to CRE outbreak in California that's left two people dead ."}

{"article":"Bafetimbi Gomis' collapse had those inside White Hart Lane holding their collective breath, with players, officials and fans fearing the worst after the Swansea striker's episode. As play was about to resume following a fine, early Nacer Chadli volley, hush fell upon the ground where three years ago Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba suffered a cardiac arrest. There was a deathly silence as paramedics and medical staff tended to Gomis, who left the White Hart Lane pitch on a stretcher and wearing an oxygen mask after several minutes of treatment. Bafetimbi Gomis lies face down on the pitch after collapsing during  Swansea's game with Tottenham . Medical staff attended to the France international for four minutes before he regained consciousness . Concerned Tottenham players look on as the Swansea forward is attended to my medical staff . Fortunately, good news soon emanated from the Swansea dressing room and, later in the evening, Gomis himself said he was 'feeling well' after fainting. It was the latest episode stemming from a long-standing fainting condition and one which left Brad Friedel, on the bench three years ago and watching from the stands on Wednesday, worried a similar incident to Muamba's was unfolding. 'It went through everyone's mind,' the veteran American said. 'Anyone who was at that game probably thought the worst immediately. 'It's not normal for someone to be standing there and collapse and you know it's going to be something serious. 'But after a minute or so the word got back, so that's why you didn't see the panic on the players' faces because everyone knew he was all right. 'It was something that had to be dealt with, of course, but it was nothing in the stratosphere of what went on with Fabrice.' Gomis, who has a history of blacking out, is taken off the field on a stretcher at White Hart Lane . Tottenham midfielder Nabil Bentalib (right) holds his head in his hands as Gomis is taken off on a stretcher . Friedel's comments were echoed by Spurs winger Andros Townsend. 'It kind of brought your memory back to Fabrice Muamba,' he said. 'It didn't look good. 'When (Muamba collapsed) I wasn't here. I was on loan at Birmingham but seeing what happened with Gomis could have meant going down the same route. 'Thankfully he's okay, hopefully he can make a speedy recovery.' As worrying as the incident was, play continued and soon after Ki Sung-yueng drew parity for Swansea. Players from both sides appear shocked as referee Michael Oliver prepares to restart the game . On 17 March 2012, Fabrice Muamba collapsed on the pitch at White Hart Lane during an FA Cup quarter-final match between Bolton and Tottenham. The former Trotters midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest and received life-saving medical treatment from Spurs staff and consultant cardiologist\u00a0Dr Andrew Deaner, who was at the game as a fan, from the pitch. Muamba was rushed to the nearby London Chest Hospital, accompanied by then manager Owen Coyle and striker Kevin Phillips, for emergency treatment while the game was abandoned. Medical staff rush to Fabrice Muamba's aid after the midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest in 2012 . Muamba's heart was reported to have stopped for 78minutes while the former Birmingham player received numerous defibrillator shocks on the pitch and in the ambulance. Despite fears that he would not survive, the 26-year-old made a miraculous recovery before being discharged from hospital on April 16 - although he was forced to retire from professional football. Ryan Mason and Townsend netted in the second half to give Spurs a lead Gylfi Sigurdsson chipped away at late on, yet Mauricio Pochettino's side ran out 3-2 victors. It was an important result following their Europa League and Capital One Cup disappointments, especially as defeat on Wednesday would have seriously dented their top-four ambitions. 'It was the perfect response,' Townsend said in a week they have lost big games against Fiorentina and Chelsea. 'To lose a cup final and have to play a very good side three days later is always difficult, but we knew we had to go out there tonight and start fast right from the off. 'We knew we had to get the crowd on our side and lift the doom and gloom from the weekend, and I think we did that. 'We got the early goal and it set us on our way to a great win.' Ryan Mason wheels away in celebration after scoring against Swansea on Wednesday evening . The result denied Swansea a third straight Premier League win, although midfielder Jack Cork does not think the performance or result was impacted by the Gomis incident. 'I was obviously worried,' he told Press Association Sport. 'When something like that happens, you're obviously worried, but the medical staff say he is fine so hopefully it's not too bad. 'The guys said 'don't worry about it, just keep your minds on the game, he is okay' blah, blah, blah. 'Ash (Williams) was just reassuring us saying don't worry about it and we had to carry on like it hadn't happened. 'In the first half we did okay, we played some okay stuff but the second half was tough for us. 'They overloaded certain areas and made space on the wings for the full-backs. 'It was tough for us but we had to try and keep a good shape and a couple of mistakes cost us the game.'","highlights":"Bafetimbi Gomis collapsed during first half of Swansea's match at Spurs .\nThe Swansea striker wanted to play on but was carried off on a stretcher .\nIncident brought back memories of Fabrice Muamba's collapse ."}

{"article":"(CNN)A Pennsylvania community is pulling together to search for an eighth-grade student who has been missing since Wednesday. The search has drawn hundreds of volunteers on foot and online. The parents of Cayman Naib, 13, have been communicating through the Facebook group \"Find Cayman\" since a day after his disappearance, according to close friend David Binswanger. Newtown Police say Cayman was last seen wearing a gray down winter jacket, black ski pants and hiking boots. He could be in the Radnor-Wayne area, roughly 20 miles from Philadelphia, or may have purchased a train ticket to Philadelphia, according to an alert posted on Facebook. \"We think that he got a email from school and was upset by it and left as an impulsive act,\" Farid Naib, Cayman's father, wrote Thursday on the group page. \"We have spoken to his friends and they do not know where he is. Cayman does have his phone, we don't know if he has any cash, he does not have his wallet.\" The parents said that his phone was out of power at the time. \"Cayman left within 30 minutes after he received an email from school regarding overdue home work (we do not blame the school) and most probably did not do any pre planning ... He is a good kid, and has no substance abuse or other issues, this is the first time he has ever done anything like this,\" his father and mother, Becky Naib, posted Friday. The parents wrote Saturday that Cayman was not wearing waterproof clothing and that he did not take his backpack. Binswanger said weather limited search efforts Wednesday, the night Cayman went missing. Wednesday it was rainy and Thursday there was 6-8 inches of snow. Hundreds of volunteers have stepped up to pass out fliers and to canvass areas, according to posts. A post late Saturday explained search efforts included \"advanced, geo-spacial tracking software to determine the exact locations where searchers went,\" and added that the search would be taken to the skies Sunday with deployment of the Civil Air Patrol. In many posts, the families appealed directly to their son. \"Cayman, if you read this please know that you are forgiven for everything, and I mean everything, you have the ultimate free pass. Just come home, we are so worried about you\" the family posted Saturday. A message to families from the head of The Shipley School, which Cayman attends, read in part: \"Cayman's sister Savannah is in ninth grade at Shipley and his parents, Farid and Becky, are terrific people. They have contacted police and are aware that we are sending you this email. We hope that Cayman is ok and are saying our prayers.\" CNN could not immediately get in touch with police or the FBI.","highlights":"Cayman Naib, 13, hasn't been heard from since Wednesday .\nPolice, family, volunteers search for eighth-grader ."}
{"article":"(CNN)ISIS apparently claimed responsibility Thursday for the deadly terrorist attack at a landmark museum in the heart of that country's capital, a mass shooting that has shaken the birthplace of the Arab Spring and stirred questions about militants in the country. In an audio statement posted online Thursday, ISIS identified two men -- Abu Zakariya al-Tunisi and Abu Anas al-Tunisi -- it said used \"automatic weapons and hand grenades\" to kill and injure what it called \"crusaders and apostates\" in the Bardo Museum in Tunis. Tunisian Health Minister Said Aidi said 23 people are believed to have been killed, including at least one who died at a hospital overnight. And that bloodshed, the ISIS message warned, is \"just the start.\" CNN cannot independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement. A U.S. official told CNN there is no reason to doubt the claim's authenticity. That said, American officials are checking the platform that the statement went out on, including the extent to which it's tied to the group calling itself the Islamic State. The current U.S. thinking is the attack may have been carried out by local \"franchise\" adherents to ISIS, rather than centrally directed by the Islamist extremist group's leadership, which is now thought to be in Syria. The two attackers were carrying explosives, Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi said in an interview Thursday with the French broadcaster TF1. He credited Tunisian security forces for responding so quickly to the attack to avoid a larger tragedy because \"terrible explosives were found on these (attackers) and they didn't have time to use them.\" Tunisia has been viewed as the lone democratic success story in the Arab Spring. But the North African nation is not without its issues, including an uneven economy and the distinction of having more citizens -- up to 3,000 Tunisians -- thought to have gone to Iraq and Syria to fight as jihadists than any other country, according to the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization in London. Authorities there have already arrested nine people in connection with Wednesday's attack, including four directly linked to the bloodshed, according to a statement from Essebsi. Earlier Thursday, Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid identified two suspects, Yassine Labidi and Saber Khachnaou, in an interview with French radio station RTL. It's not clear if those two men were the pair killed at the museum by Tunisian security forces, or if it's possible they're the same people as those identified -- using new names -- in ISIS' audio statement. Labidi was \"known to the security services, he was flagged and monitored,\" Essid said. But he added the man wasn't known or being followed for anything special. The siege took place just days after a Tunisian jihadist tweeted that a pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, was coming soon, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors terrorist propaganda. In his message, the jihadist claimed to belong to Jund al-Khilafah in Tunisia, a group that in December pledged allegiance to ISIS, even though that vow hadn't seemed to have fully registered with the Islamist extremist group. His post comes after an ISIS fighter in the extremist group's stronghold of Raqqa in Syria recently appeared in a video questioning why militants in Tunisia had not pledged fealty. \"This raises the possibility that the museum attack could be ISIS' debut on the Tunisian stage, timed to precede a pledge of allegiance from Tunisian jihadis for maximum impact,\" CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said. The attack may have been in and about Tunisia, but the vast majority of the victims were foreigners. They came from various backgrounds, from a Spanish couple to a Colombian mother and son. In addition to those pairs, the dead included three Italians, three Japanese, two French, two Poles, a Belgian, a Russian and a Briton, according to cruise ship companies and their respective governments. Three Tunisians, one of them a security officer and another a job applicant, also were killed, according to Aidi. Twelve of those killed had been aboard the MSC Splendida, a cruise ship with more than 3,700 passengers and nearly 1,300 crew that docked in Tunis hours before the bloodshed, its parent company said in a statement. Five more victims came from a similar vessel, the Costa Fascinosa, which was at port in the Tunisian capital at the same time, according to Costa Cruises. Another 36 people remain hospitalized, while eight others were treated and released. The Bardo had been a logical stop for these tourists, housed next to Tunisia's Parliament in a 19th century palace and cast as a \"jewel of Tunisian heritage,\" with its exhibits showcasing the country's art, culture and history. Its prominent place in Tunisia's economy -- which banks heavily on tourism, with millions visiting the country each year -- also made it a logical target for terrorists. \"They hit the heart of our livelihood,\" said Mohammed Ali Troudi, a taxi driver in Tunis. It's too early to tell how tourists will react to the attack. Both the MSC Splendida and the Costa Fascinosa have since left Tunis, even as the search continues for some of their missing passengers -- at least four from the Splendida and two from the Fascinosa, according to their respective companies. The question is whether more passenger-packed cruise ships, as well as commercial airliners filled with tourists, will come to Tunisia in the future. Travelers warned of risks as Tunisia reels from attack . The economy and terrorism are linked in Tunisia, in the sense that high youth unemployment and sparse opportunities are thought to have contributed to the large numbers becoming jihadists -- whether abroad or at home. Attacking what Tunisian lawmaker Sabrine Ghoubantini called \"a symbol of sovereignty in Tunisia\" likely won't help. \"It's really sad,\" Ghoubantini told CNN from Tunis, \"and I hope that it won't really affect our economy.\" The government has been battling a jihadist presence in the Chaambi Mountains. And in February, the country's Interior Ministry announced the arrests of about 100 alleged extremists and published a video allegedly showing that the group possessed a formula for making explosives and a photograph of ISIS leader al-Baghdadi. Mehrezia Labidi, another parliamentarian, says it's imperative that the message gets across to would-be jihadists that \"life in democracy is better than\" what terrorist recruiters are telling them. \"We have really to work on the culture, the level of ideas,\" she said. Meanwhile, she and others stressed that the vast majority of Tunisians -- including secular-minded citizens and moderate Islamists -- need to come together for their country and against these extremist views and tactics. \"They are trying to terrify us. But the whole Tunisian people is unified -- all the parties, all the civil society organizations, all the countries are unified,\" Ghoubantini said. \"... I'm sure that we will fight terrorism and that we will really eradicate it from our country.\" CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Barbara Starr, Karl Penhaul, Marilia Brocchetto, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Arwa Damon, Salma Abdelaziz and journalists Yasmine Ryan and Livia Borghese contributed to this report.","highlights":"Attackers were unable to use their explosives, Tunisia President tells broadcaster .\nISIS statement: Attackers used weapons to target \"crusaders and apostates\"\nTunisian authorities arrest 9 in connection with the Bardo Museum attack ."}
{"article":"(CNN)A teenage Australian jihadist suspected of having carried out an ISIS suicide attack developed a hatred for the West over the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, before settling on radical Islam as a vehicle for \"violent global revolution,\" according to his purported blog. Jake Bilardi, an 18-year-old student from Melbourne, appears to have documented his path to radicalization and his experiences in ISIS-held territory in a blog, titled \"From the eyes of a Mujahir: An Australian Mujahir in the land of the Khilafah.\" The blog has been deleted, but a cached version remains available online. CNN could not independently verify the blog's authenticity, but the biographical details detailed on the blog match Bilardi's. One of the final posts on the blog, which is credited to \"Abu Abdullah al-Australi,\" purports to have been posted on January 13, as the author was \"preparing to sacrifice my life for Islam in Ramadi.\" The Australian government said Wednesday it was working to confirm reports that Bilardi had carried out a suicide attack on behalf of ISIS, after the terror group claimed an \"Abu Abdullah al-Australi\" had been killed in a car bombing during an offensive in the city of Ramadi. The claims were made along with a picture that appeared to be of Bilardi, referred to as \"Abu Abdullah al-Australi,\" apparently prior to carrying out the mission. The blogger describes having a \"very comfortable\" upbringing as the youngest of six in the Melbourne suburbs, where he was raised an atheist, excelled in his studies and \"dreamed of becoming a political journalist.\" He describes how his older siblings educated him on various subjects, and how his brother's instruction on international politics held a special resonance for him, particularly after the September 11 attacks. \"Being just five years old at the time of the attacks ... my knowledge of the operation was basically non-existent. Despite this, I was immediately drawn to the topics of al Qaeda and 'Islamic terrorism',\" he wrote. \"It was from here that my research into al Qaeda ... and groups with similar ideologies worldwide began. I spent every day researching online and reading the books I had begun collecting.\" The blogger writes that it was his reading on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and abuses committed by occupying forces, \"that gave birth to my disdain for the United States and its allies, including Australia. It was also the start of my respect for the mujahideen that would only grow to develop into a love of Islam and ultimately bring me here to the Islamic State.\" Eventually, he wrote, he came to view democracy as \"nothing but a system of lies and deception,\" one which \"focuses heavily on providing the people with so-called freedom\" but \"throws celebrities and false reality into the spotlight to distract the people from what is really going on in the world.\" The wars \"signaled the beginning of my complete hatred and opposition to the entire system Australia and the majority of the world was based upon,\" he wrote. \"It was also the moment I realised that violent global revolution was necessary to eliminate this system of governance and that... I would likely be killed in this struggle.\" While the blogger said he had come to the conclusion that democracy was \"something that can only and must be destroyed by violent revolution,\" he wrote, he \"was never quite sure\" what should replace it. \"Socialism? Communism?? Nazism???\" he wrote. Eventually, as his interest in jihadist groups deepened at about the time of the Arab Spring, he settled on Islam. \"It was Islam that for me stood out as easy to understand and was shockingly consistent with established historical and scientific facts,\" he wrote. Following a stretch in which he turned his back on his growing extremist beliefs, which he described as \"one of the most shameful periods of my life,\" the blogger wrote that he began to try to find a contact to help him join Jabhat al-Nusra or Ahrar al-Sham, two Islamist groups fighting in Syria. His attempts were unsuccessful. While he had initially rejected ISIS after \"falling for the many lies being spread against them,\" he wrote that he began speaking to their members online, and, after witnessing their military successes, developed a desire to join the group. Eventually, he managed to find a contact who promised to get him into ISIS territory. Worried that his plot to leave Australia might be foiled by authorities, the blogger wrote that he developed his \"Plan B,\" collecting materials for what he envisaged as a \"string of bombings across Melbourne, targeting foreign consulates and political\/military targets as well as grenade and knife attacks on shopping centers and cafes and culminating with myself detonating a belt of explosives amongst the kuffar.\" Victoria police confirmed Wednesday that chemicals that could be used to make an explosive device had been found in a search of his family's home in the Melbourne suburb of Craigieburn. The blogger wrote that he abandoned his plans for an attack in Melbourne after realizing that buying bomb-making chemicals could draw the attention of authorities and ruin his bid to join ISIS. He did not reveal how he had been able to enter ISIS territory, but said that on entering the ISIS-held Syrian city of Jarablus, he \"felt a joy I had never experienced before.\" In another blog post, entitled \"Being white in the Islamic State: The abolition of racism\" he wrote approvingly that the \"Islamic State has been successful in eliminating racism and in building the world's only true multi-ethnic state.\" He said he signed up for a \"martyrdom operation,\" or suicide attack, in Baiji, Iraq, which failed, before registering to undertake another in Ramadi, where he was \"waiting for my turn to stand before Allah.\" Clarke Jones, an expert on radicalization at the Australian National University, said that Bilardi \"blew away the profile of what most people think of when they think of people who are going to support the Islamic State.\" White and middle class, reportedly bullied at school and vulnerable following the loss of his mother to cancer, he more easily fit the profile of a school shooter than an Islamic terrorist, he said. \"What it does show us is that there are a whole range of profiles,\" he said. Bilardi's aunt has linked the teen's troubles to the loss of his mother, while a former classmate at Melbourne's Craigieburn Secondary College described him as shy. Jones said Bilardi's case was also notable in that he did not appear to have been \"groomed\" by terror recruiters -- indeed, he wrote of initially struggling to make contacts among Islamic extremists -- and had radicalized himself through his own readings. \"The PM here said Jake was brainwashed -- I don't think he was brainwashed. He was very calculated in what he did and documented it quite clearly,\" said Jones. In one of the blog posts, the blogger says that the warm welcome he and other foreign fighters had received in the Islamic State disproved \"the Australian government's laughable claim that we are used as 'cannon fodder'.\" But Jones said his Bilardi's ultimate fate in a suicide mission was typical for foreign fighters in his position. He believed that in knowingly signing up for this fate, on two separate occasions, Bilardi had been seeking the kind of recognition and achievement that, as a vulnerable teen, he had been denied at home. \"He wanted that 'religious prize',\" he said. CNN's Hilary Whiteman contributed to this report.","highlights":"An Australian teen suspected of an ISIS suicide bombing left behind a purported blog .\nIt traces his path to radicalization, seeking to destroy the democratic West before finding Islam .\nPolice say he planned attacks in his hometown of Melbourne before abandoning the plot ."}
{"article":"London (CNN)Tunisia's ultra-radical fringe has come back to bite a government born out of the most successful experiment in constitutional reform to emerge from the 2011 Arab Spring revolutions. Wednesday's attack on the Bardo Museum in Tunis was grimly predictable, coming from what the Tunisian Interior Ministry calls a violent ultra-radical Islamist fringe forced underground -- but not crushed -- by security services. Jihadist firebrands representing thousands of active militants at home and abroad have been threatening retribution on Tunisia's outward-looking, investment-friendly majority. The attack was carried out by two gunmen, believed to have been supported by at least two accomplices. It may torpedo efforts to revive Tunisia's employment-generating tourism industry and may discourage other big-spending visitors. It will probably lead Tunisians -- who have shown a sage propensity to unite in the face of greatest adversity despite a marked appetite for political bickering -- to support a robust response by elected President Beji Caid Essebsi. The attack adds to the global narrative by which Islamic revolutionaries -- increasingly flying under the flag of the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) -- pose an existential crisis to moderate states, often Western allies, in the Arab world. Tunisia is the sole country to have emerged from an Arab Spring revolution with its political process intact -- current president, Essebsi, who was elected in November 2014, and his ruling coalition, are the products of a long constitutional process. In four tumultuous years they have competed hard with, but also showed a capacity to work with, opposition parties, led by the \"moderate Islamist\" Ennahda, which is represented in government and parliament. Islamists of a very different hue were responsible for the Bardo attack. Local Salafist groups (of whom the best known is Ansar Al-Sharia) as well as multinational units including ISIS have been most effective in recruiting disaffected young Tunisians in the capital's poorer quarters and in dusty towns of the south and interior, where the original revolution that removed Ben Ali in February 2011 surged up. Legitimate claims for more jobs and resources in these underprivileged areas during the four subsequent years have largely come to nothing, adding to frustrations. Radical jihadists -- some with back bases in Libya and Algeria -- have posed a major security challenge to successive governments, murdering two prominent \"secular\" politicians in 2013. The Tunisian armed forces, supported by Algeria's more experienced and better equipped military, have been fighting jihadist radicals in the Mount Chaambi region for nearly three years. They have yet to declare final victory, pointing to the resilience of underground groups. While successive governments have acted against radical Salafist groups, thousands of Tunisians have gone underground; they are widely believed to make up the biggest national group fighting with jihadists in Syria (over 3,000 by many accounts), and are present in Libya and other failing states. In January 2013, Tunisians and Libyans made up the majority of jihadists who attacked a strategic gas plant operated by BP and Statoil in southern Algeria. So, the Bardo attackers are a known enemy. Prime Minister Habib Essid has promised a robust security response. But the Tunis tragedy is unlikely to have any immediate impact on the political process. A majority of Tunisians remain foursquare behind preserving \"republican institutions,\" even if they vocally disagree on the detail of policy. It will remind Tunisia's many friends that the country's transition is brittle, and that Tunis needs commitments of support to become reality, with more military and wider financial assistance, and, above all, investment that can kickstart an economy in the doldrums since 2011. Massacre at the Bardo places Tunisia more centrally within the global ISIS narrative, which has recently expanded to neighboring Libya. It is a ghastly way to remind the world that Tunisia's experiment in democratic reform needs all the help it can get.","highlights":"Jon Marks: Ultra-radical fringe has previously threatened Tunisia's liberal majority .\nMajority of Tunisians likely to support robust response from president, he writes .\nAttacks a reminder that Tunisia's transition to democracy is \"brittle,\" Marks says ."}
{"article":"(CNN)What a difference a couple of years makes. A federal judge has struck down Nebraska's ban on same-sex marriage, calling it an \"unabashedly gender-specific infringement of the equal rights of its citizens.\" U.S. District Judge Joseph Bataillon's decision Monday means that same-sex marriage is now against the law in fewer than one in four states. Nebraska state officials immediately appealed the ruling to the 8th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. Bataillon denied a state request to stay his decision. And so, beginning Monday the state must \"treat same-sex couples the same as different sex couples\" when it comes to marriage rights, the federal injunction reads. As the dominoes fall in favor of same-sex marriages, the question now seems to be which state will be the last? The number of states offering same-sex marriages has surged since the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in 2013 that invalidated part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. States like Illinois, Hawaii, Minnesota and New York joined the fold voluntarily, while others -- most recently Nebraska and Alabama -- were ordered by state or federal judges to offer and recognize the unions. The case involving Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee is expected to be decided sometime in June by the U.S. Supreme Court. Here's the situation in the 12 states that currently ban same-sex marriages: . The state's constitutional ban on gay marriage, passed in 2004, was struck down twice last year -- once by a state court judge and again by a U.S. District Court judge. Local officials issued some 400 marriage licenses following the state court decision, but the state Supreme Court blocked the issuance of more licenses pending its review of the case. A decision could come soon. Georgia is one of just two states with no legislative action or pending legal decisions whatsoever on same-sex marriage. The other is North Dakota. However, lawsuits are pending to overturn the state's 2004 ban. The state's ban is being challenged in state court, where a judge last year ruled the law is unconstitutional, and in federal court, where a U.S. District Court judge took the rare step, for a federal judge, of backing such a ban. The ban remains in place pending Louisiana's appeal of the state court ruling. On the federal level, a ruling is pending out of the U.S Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which heard arguments in the case in January. Last year, a U.S. District Court judge ruled that the state's constitutional amendment banning gay marriages had no \"legitimate purpose.\" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit later overturned the ruling, reinstating gay marriage bans in Kentucky and four other states. The Kentucky ban is part of the U.S. Supreme Court case scheduled for arguments in April and a decision by June. A U.S. District Court judge ruled last year that the state's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional, resulting in the issuance of more than 300 marriage licenses. That ended when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted a stay. The court later reinstated Michigan's ban in the same ruling that reinstated Kentucky's ban. Its fate will be decided by the Supreme Court decision due by June. A state court judge ruled in November that Missouri's 2004 constitutional ban on gay marriage was illegal. Attorney General Chris Koster appealed the ruling to the state Supreme Court. But that court has indicated that it will not rule on the case until after the U.S. Supreme Court decision. Just a few days after that state court ruling, a U.S. District Court judge struck down the state's marriage ban, but that decision has been stayed pending appeals. While the state ban is in effect, officials in the St. Louis area have issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples. A U.S. District Court judge granted an injunction last year against the state's same-sex marriage ban, describing it as unconstitutional. The judge, however, postponed his ruling from going into effect to give the state time to appeal. A federal appeals court heard arguments in the case in January. In the meantime, the same-sex marriage ban is still in effect. Same-sex couples are challenging the state's ban in U.S. District Court, but a federal judge issued a ruling on January 20 delaying the proceedings until after the U.S. Supreme Court rules. U.S. District Court Judge Karen Schreier struck down the state's same-sex marriage ban in January, but blocked enforcement pending an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The state's ban was struck down in January 2014 by a federal judge who said it serves \"no legitimate governmental purpose.\" But, as in many other states, enforcement was delayed pending appeals. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard the case last month and a ruling is pending. A federal appeals court judge upheld a ban last year on same-sex marriages in  the state. That decision is part of the U.S. Supreme Court case expected to be finalized this summer. In November 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld the state's ban. That decision also will be part of the U.S. Supreme Court case.","highlights":"12 states do not allow same-sex marriages .\nThe U.S. Supreme Court could settle the issue for good when it rules this year ."}

That was the verdict of many around the continent, who found Friday morning's solar eclipse picture perfect. Millions from around North Africa, the Middle East as well as Europe woke up with a chance to see the rare cosmic event. For some of them, it was a partial eclipse; but others -- say if you were at the North Pole, or in Svalbard or the Faroe Islands between Iceland and Norway -- got the full deal. Such eclipses are basically as old as the galaxy itself, happening when the moon and sun are at just the right distance from the Earth and they appear to be of the same apparent size in the sky -- even though the sun is actually about 400 times larger. An eclipse happens when the moon passes right in front of the sun, blocking the sunlight and casting a shadow on the Earth. That means what used to be morning suddenly looks like nighttime again, until the sun and moon get out of each other's way. Staring at the sun anytime can be a bit dangerous, even when it's there, not there, then there again during an eclipse. That's where the term \"eclipse blindness\" -- which is really retinal burns -- comes from. Luckily, a lot of those peering into the skies Friday came prepared. At least that was the case for famous Bayern Munich footballers Xabi Alonso and Pepe Reina, who looked cool looking up in their 3-D movie-type glasses. Or a bunch of children at Stockport Grammar, a British school not far from Manchester. One of them looked more like a welder than a stargazer but didn't seem to mind, giving a thumbs-up to the view. Not everyone was similarly enthused; not because they don't love a good eclipse, but because they don't like a bad one. CNN's Nick Thompson in London, for instance, went out hoping for an out-of-this-world experience and instead saw little more than a bunch of clouds. He wasn't alone, as many in Britain in particular didn't get the big show they'd hoped for. Clouds be damned, some folks there used a sun costume, along with an Earth-and-moon prop, to put on a show of their own. If the sun won't come out for you, then you might as well be the sun, their reasoning went. Even in the United Kingdom, whether you were Glasgow University students cheering when a glimpse of the eclipse emerged from the clouds or a bird soaring the sky, there was a lot of enthusiasm for the eclipse. And there were even more cheers elsewhere, in Berlin, Beirut and beyond. Norwegians, especially, got some of the most spectacular perspectives. Eclipses aren't everyday events, and they're getting less common. While there will be more full eclipses, they will get rarer and rarer as the moon moves away from the Earth at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters (about 1.5 inches) every year. That means there will come a time when the moon will appear to be too small to cover the sun. But don't sweat it just yet: NASA calculates this will take about 563 million years, meaning there's still time to catch another eclipse. Weather permitting, of course. CNN's Dave Gilbert contributed to this report.","highlights":"The moon blocks the sun, casts a shadow across parts of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East .\nThe view of the resulting eclipse is particularly impressive in places like Norway .\nIt's also seen around Europe, though clouds obscure the views of many in England ."}
{"article":"(CNN)A gloved hand reaches for a scantily-clad backside. It could be an image from the hit television series \"Mad Men,\" which documented the ribald world of advertising in 1960s America. Except this is 2015 and \"Who squeezes them in Harelbeke?\" is the poster strapline for the elite E3 Harelbeke competition in Belgium, accompanied by that gloved cyclist's hand poised to pinch a woman's bottom. Unlike the wind provocatively lifting up her skirt, the controversial advertisement wasn't dreamed up out of thin air. It's inspired by previous winner Slovak Peter Sagan, who pinched a podium girl's behind at the 2013 Tour de Flanders -- something he later apologized for, saying \"I promise to act more respectfully in the future.\" A week earlier, he was also pictured on the E3 Harelbeke podium, making an ass-grabbing motion towards another flower girl. E3 Harelbeke's organizers chose to celebrate his antics in their 2015 campaign, sparking a global debate about sexism in cycling that has raced far beyond the billboard. \"Old Boy's Club\" \"A guy grabbing a woman's ass is very much indicative of a level of sexual assault,\" said Kathryn Bertine, former professional cyclist and director of \"Half the Road,\" a documentary about female racers. \"This poster makes cycling look very outdated. They're relying on a 'good old boys club' tactic to help them sell a product -- and in this case that product is racing.\" Judging by E3 Harelebeke's provocative standards, the poster could even appear tame compared to previous years. In 2011 organizers opted for a naked woman lying in a field, while the silhouettes of miniature riders traversed her bare backside. More baffling was last year's poster featuring a woman straddling three other females curled into the shape of a bike. \"Such provocative imagery may have been seen by some in the 1950s and 1960s as a basis for selling products, but marketing communications are a rather more sophisticated and progressive activity than they were 50 years ago,\" said Simon Chadwick, Professor of Sport Business Strategy and Marketing at Coventry University. \"I think E3 Harelbeke are rather out of kilter with the way that most people think today.\" \"A playful nod\" Cycling's world governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) has since requested the poster be removed, to which the E3 Harelbeke organisers have agreed -- not that they necessarily see it as offensive themselves. \"Personally, no I don't think it's sexist,\" Marc Claerhout, E3 Harelebeke manager, told CNN. Could he see why others might find it offensive? \"I don't know. You have a lot of publicity where you see more than some underwear,\" he said. \"And we didn't mean it as sexist.\" The organization has since withdrawn the poster, releasing an official apology to \"anyone who might find it intimidating, discriminatory or sexist.\" \"The organization launched this campaign as a playful nod to the stage incident two years ago in which a rider got ready to squeeze the buttocks of a flower girl,\" it added. Removing the poster is one thing -- but the UCI missed an opportunity to make an example of a tournament which has used seemingly sexist campaigns for years, said Olympic road race champion, Nicole Cooke. \"Telling the race organizers to remove the posters is not much of a deterrent,\" added the retired cyclist whose autobiography \"The Breakaway\" highlighted sexism within the sport during her over decade long career. \"A whopping fine and canceling the race would have sent out the strong message that there is no place for sexism in cycling. Instead, the race has received huge publicity.\" Celebrating sexual assault? The poster also glorifies what would be seen as sexual assault in any other workplace, said Laura Bates, founder of the \"Everyday Sexism Project.\" \"It contains a direct reference to an incident of sexual assault, which shouldn't be treated as something to celebrate and joke about,\" she added. Similarly, Belgium's Institute for the Equality between Men and Women, said the image violated 2007 anti-discrimination legislation and \"incited sexual intimidation.\" It's unlikely the same image would have been used in a female tournament. \"Not only is the poster sexist -- this race doesn't even have a women's field,\" said Bertine, who has long campaigned for a women's edition of the Tour de France equal to the men's -- a race often seen as the ultimate prize in cycling. \"Here we are, fighting these battles to make equality happen. And posters like this are not helping to pave the way for cycling,\" she said. She sees the problem not with the majority of \"supportive\" male cyclists, but with the lack of female representation among race directors and promoters. Money talks . Indeed, sponsorship is a big factor is getting a race like the Women's Tour de France off the ground, said Alex Russell, one of two females on the board of British Cycling. \"A lot of it comes down to whether something has a market value -- and it's not necessarily down to gender,\" she said. \"We've introduced a women's tour in Britain and we have got financial support for that. But you can't just jump to mass spectators and mass broadcasting because these things grow incrementally.\" Former World Road Race champion Cooke points to the discrepancy in prize money as another big obstacle for women within the sport. \"The inspiration for the poster is the 2013 Tour de Flanders, for which male winner Fabian Cancellara received \u20ac20,000 ($22,000) for his efforts. In comparison, when I won this event, I was happy for the team to split the modest \u20ac1,000 I received amongst the other riders,\" she said. \"The biggest change I would recommend to provide protection, security and credibility for female road riders, would be the introduction of a minimum wage, as there is in place for male riders,\" added Cooke. \"Cycling cannot be allowed to exist outside the laws of society, like some sort of medieval anarchy.\" It seems that rather than a podium girl's bottom, the one being put under the spotlight at this year's event, will be the organizers themselves.","highlights":"Belgium cycling tournament scraps poster of podium girl's bum .\nSparks global debate about sexism in cycling ."}
{"article":"(CNN)I was finishing my studies when the war began four years ago. I had only two subjects remaining before I graduated from university with a degree in English literature. Since I was 10 years old, I have loved English and dreamed of becoming a teacher. I want to teach the younger ones, especially now, because children are the ones who will rebuild our country. They are Syria's future, and they deserve our significant investment. Three years ago, my family was forced to flee our home near Damascus, in east Ghouta. Thankfully, we got out before chemical warfare was used there. We stayed in Syria for the next year, moving from one house to another, from one village to another. With each move, we felt no comfort, no safety. When you feel unsafe in a place that is being bombed nearly every day, you eventually must make a choice: Ours was to leave. And with only two packed bags, we did. We went to Jordan. I've thought of returning to Syria. I want to be part of my country's rebuilding, but sadly, I don't expect this to happen any time soon. When we arrived in Jordan, I thought I would return soon to Syria -- in only a few weeks. We all thought so. It's been two years. And while I still hope to go home one day, my biggest question is: \"When?\" I want to return so that I can teach. As a child, I was inspired by my third-grade teacher, who believed children are the future and who challenged us at that young age to create a better world. I think it's rare for a teacher to instill this so passionately in her students, but I want to try. Although I hope to follow in my teacher's footsteps, my path for now is blocked by the uncertainty of living far from home, by a war that has driven me here, by tuition costs in Jordan that are prohibitively expensive. Being away from home presents many challenges. You feel like a stranger in a foreign place. You're not among people who know you, or who want to know you.  As a Syrian refugee, it is nearly impossible to get permission to be officially employed, and I've no money to complete my studies. Overnight, my dreams changed. In one moment I was at home with family and friends dreaming of studying English, of becoming a schoolteacher.  In the next, it all feels lost. It's impossible to work, impossible to study. We hope to meet our needs today, not so much to fulfill our dreams tomorrow. In Syria, I was responsible to my parents, now I am responsible for them. I dreamed of being a teacher, but because my parents are old, I must try each week just to protect them, to cover their basic needs of shelter, food and medicine. I needed some way to support my family. While most Syrians are not permitted to work, we can volunteer. I found a role with the poverty-fighting organization CARE in the urban refugee center in East Amman, Jordan, where I earn a stipend doing meaningful volunteer work. I have enjoyed it so much. After working there, I have become more social, and no longer feel isolated. It's not like sitting at home, feeling powerless, losing confidence, wondering what I can do to help my family, to help my people. Instead, I feel empowered. I recognize my potential. And, because of that, I refuse to give up on my dreams. My hope is to resettle for the short term in another country so I can continue my studies. I want to complete my education -- and reclaim my dream of teaching Syrian children. Resettling could help shape my future so that I can help shape theirs. One day, I will tell them of the crisis we faced in the Syria that I left. We must be aware of this history, and learn from it. We must empower children to speak up and then be sure that their voices are heard. Change starts with them. And it starts with us. Each person has the right to pursue an education, to meet their most basic needs, to express themselves. When those rights are stifled, so, too, is a person's potential, her opportunities, her power to create a better world, and in my case, a better Syria. My question to the U.S. people and the international community is this: Imagine your life has been turned upside down after you lose everything in a matter of hours: What do you believe in then? What do you cling to? The answer, I think, is: your dreams. We all have them. Mine, for the time being, have been deferred.","highlights":"Four years of war means four years without schools and education in Syria .\nHiba was nearly done with university when she was forced to flee her home near Damascus .\nTo help Hiba and the many other displaced Syrian students, go to CARE ."}
{"article":"Ashley Young says Manchester United will go for the kill when they head to Liverpool on Sunday. After beating Tottenham last weekend, United have a chance to further strengthen their grip on fourth when they face their old rivals at Anfield. A draw would be enough to keep United two points ahead of fifth-placed Liverpool, but Young knows victory would put further daylight between the two teams, who both have nine matches left. Ashley Young says Manchester United will go for the kill when they head to Liverpool on Sunday . 'We will go there looking for the three points,' the United winger said. 'We are going there to win, you don't go to a place to try and draw. The performance against Tottenham was brilliant but we have a tough game coming up at Liverpool. We have got to dust ourselves down in the right way and go for the three points again.' Questions had been raised about Louis van Gaal's team selection and tactics in the wake of United's FA Cup exit to Arsenal, but everything fell into place last weekend as United put on by far their best performance of the season. United have a chance to further strengthen their grip on fourth when they face their old rivals at Anfield . Young thinks United will therefore go into Sunday's game in high spirits, but he insists confidence in the camp has never been a problem this season despite a number of uninspiring team displays. He said: 'Morale has always been high. Confidence has always been there too. 'We were obviously disappointed after the Arsenal game. I said afterwards that it will show how our team spirit and character is with how we bounce back. The Manchester United players celebrate as they beat Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford . 'I think if you look at the first 45 minutes (against Spurs) then that was exactly the right way to bounce back.' Young praised Van Gaal's methods, insisting some players had improved under the Dutchman's stewardship. He is undoubtedly one of them. The 29-year-old was expected to leave Old Trafford last summer, but he has been one of the best outfield players in the squad this season. Young praised Louis van Gaal's methods, insisting players had improved under the Dutchman's stewardship . Fellaini was heavily criticised during David Moyes' reign but had improved under Van Gaal . Marouane Fellaini is another player who seems to be improving under Van Gaal. Fellaini was heavily criticised during David Moyes' reign, but the big Belgian has earned plaudits for his performances in the no.10 role of late. 'He has been very important for us. He has been in the team and when he is in the box, I'm not sure many teams can handle him,' Young said of the \u00a327.5million midfielder. Belgian midfielder Fellaini celebrates with Wayne Rooney after scoring the opening goal against \u00a0Tottenham . 'You saw (against Tottenham) that he was fantastic at getting in the box and looking like a striker at times. 'I think he likes playing in that position. We just have to utilise his strengths and I think we did that really well on Sunday.

{"article":"(CNN)From the sweltering heat of the Sahara Desert to the subzero temperatures at both North and South Poles, Fiona Oakes' running obsession knows no bounds. Dubbed the \"Queen of the Extreme,\" the record-breaking runner has completed more than 50 marathons and ultramarathons, but she remains determinedly modest about her feats. \"I don't keep my medals, I don't know where they are. I don't have trophies -- people have cabinets of trophies -- the dogs have chewed most of mine,\" Oakes told CNN's Human to Hero series. \"I don't have cuttings from newspapers ... I'm not interested. I would never say to people: 'I am this' or 'I am that' -- it's not something that I'm predisposed to shout about. I don't think I'm very special at all, to be honest.\" Perhaps the 48-year-old needs to rethink her definition of special given her punishing schedule is religiously maintained despite her suffering from a potentially crippling knee complaint -- a legacy of reconstructive surgery during her teens. \"I had a tumor (in my right knee) when I was 14 years old, it wasn't discovered until I was 17, by which time I had lost an awful lot of weight -- I think I weighed around five stone,\" she explains. \"In the end I had radical surgery to remove the kneecap and knee joint. It was in plaster for about three years. I was told that I wouldn't walk properly again, let alone do anything like running. It's painful when I run, but I can manage it because I know what to expect.\" Oakes started running properly just over a decade ago and soon found her stride, winning her first half-marathon in a course-record time before stepping up to compete over 26.2 miles and beyond. Today, she routinely finishes conventional marathons in around two hours, 50 minutes and has a personal best of two hours, 38 minutes -- a shade over the A standard required to qualify for the 2012 Olympic Games. When she's not pounding the tarmac in city marathons, Oakes competes in some of the world's toughest endurance races counting the Volcano Marathon in Chile's Atacama Desert -- an 150-mile ultramarathon run at altitudes in excess of 4,400 meters (14,600 feet) -- and the similarly challenging Marathon des Sables where competitors run six marathons in six days through the Sahara Desert among her conquests. She still winces at the memory of competing in that 154-mile Saraha event, dubbed the world's toughest footrace. \"The Marathon des Sables in 2012 was appallingly tough. The week before I went I broke two toes -- a horse stood on my foot. \"Trying to complete the Marathon des Sables is a tough ask, but trying to complete it with broken toes was brutal. For the whole week I lived on painkillers ... it was just appalling, but it did toughen me up,\" she says. The following year, Oakes broke three world records becoming the fastest woman to run a marathon on each continent -- clocking an aggregate time of 26 hours, 18 minutes and 43 seconds -- as well as recording the fastest aggregate and elapsed times for running marathons on all seven continents plus the North Pole -- a place she remembers warmly. \"I think my favorite marathon has to be the North Pole, purely because it's a marathon on the top of the world. It's such an unrealistic place to be actually running a marathon, and also I caught a glimpse of a polar bear -- which has to be one of the highlights of my life.\" There is no let up in her schedule when she's crosses the finish line -- once she's got her breath back it's straight back to the day job running an animal sanctuary at her home in Asheldham, Essex. With 400 animals including horses, pigs, sheep and dogs to care for around the clock as well as keeping up her training routine of 100 miles every week, it's no surprise that Oakes has little time for anything else. \"My life is very, very regimented, it's hard to fit in the running around caring for the animals. I have to get up at 3.30 in the morning and I work through till probably nine or 10 o'clock at night,\" she says. \"People forget that if you train for something very, very hard it has a detrimental effect on the people around you. I have no personal or family life. Every minute of my time that is not spent caring for my animals is spent dedicated to running. \"It might be that whenever someone else is having a Christmas day lunch, I'm putting my running shoes and going out to run 30 miles.\" Running has helped her raise money for the animal sanctuary and also allowed her to promote a positive image of veganism, though Oakes, who hasn't eaten animal products since her teenage years, is keen not to sound too preachy. \"I don't like to dwell on the vegan thing because (you) quickly gets marked as some sort of fruitcake or an animal rights extremist and I don't want to appear to be telling people what to do -- it's a personal thing,\" she says. But she cannot deny feeling a deep sense of satisfaction about helping change the perception that vegans somehow lack energy because of their diet. \"I became so frustrated by constantly being told you can't do (running) as a vegan (and that) vegans are weak, vegans will keel over if they try to do something extreme. I wanted to prove my point. \"I just want to be an example to say that if these people are considering this lifestyle, it can be done on a plant-based diet.\" As if to hammer home her point, Oakes recently attempted to run seven marathons in seven days on seven continents -- running in a \"cow costume\" to raise awareness of animal cruelty. Her hopes of completing the Triple 7 Quest were dashed at the last though when poor weather prevented her flying from Chile to Antarctica to complete the final leg of the race. \"It was really devastating at the finish, but I couldn't wait, I had to come home for the animals. I'm not at an extendable budget with time so I had to leave,\" she said. Next month, Oakes will be off on her travels again, returning to Morocco to compete in her third Marathon des Sables, before heading back onto the road to compete at the Berlin Marathon later in the year where she aims to better her 17th-place finish achieved in 2006. \"I'm always focusing on what I'm about to do next,\" she says, before quietly conceding running isn't always her favorite activity. \"I don't particularly enjoy running. The training is extremely difficult and I do push to the absolute limits. I enjoy the results that are achieved from the running ... I like to take on challenges that would be almost impossible and prove that I can do it.\"","highlights":"British amateur runner competes in marathons and ultramarathons .\nOakes underwent reconstructive surgery on knee as a teenager .\nThe 48-year old runs to raise money for her animal sanctuary .\nOakes is passionate about veganism and promoting positive image of plant-based diet ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Madonna, saying something controversial? Perish the thought. The object of her scorn fighting back? Of course. The mayor of Rochester, Michigan, has written an open letter to the venerable pop star, taking her to task for saying she never wanted to go back the town where she went to high school. \"I can't be around basic, provincial-thinking people,\" she told Howard Stern last week on his SiriusXM satellite radio program. You could almost hear the steam coming out of Mayor Bryan Barnett's ears. \"It's like someone calling one of your kids ugly,\" the Detroit Free Press quoted Barnett as saying. \"You're not going to let that go by without a response.\" In his letter, published Monday in the Free Press, Barnett said the city's recent achievements are anything but provincial. \"Our school district is one of the top performing in the state and boasts two Blue Ribbon Schools, the most in Michigan. Our Universities are among the fastest growing in the Midwest and are rich with cultural and ethnic diversity,\" he wrote. Buying Madonna's house: A tale of fame and misfortune . \"We design and build more robots than any other city in North America, and Rochester Hills residents and businesses have been granted over 900 patents, nearly one a day, over the last three years. Not a typical achievement you would associate with 'simple or basic' people,\" he wrote. He also noted the city was also named one of the 10 best places to live by Money magazine. \"We are many things, Madonna, but basic and provincial minded we are not!\" Barnett wrote. \"I invite you back to Rochester Hills to see who we are and what we believe in. While we certainly don't need your stamp of approval, I am quite confident we would earn it.\" Not surprisingly, some Rochester Hills citizens weren't thrilled with Madonna's comments. \"Makes me proud to live in Rochester Hills after reading this letter to Madonna by @MayorBarnett,\" Twitter user LoganBrown97 wrote. And although Madonna hasn't responded to the fracas, she of course found some defenders on social media. \"Why is everyone mad Madonna said Rochester was basic?\" Twitter user itsleah wrote. \"It IS basic. I thought that was the appeal? Small towns AREN'T for everyone, dummies.\" Of course, Madonna is no stranger to controversy, and she's angered organizations a lot bigger and more powerful than Rochester City Hall. Remember the 1980s, when her \"Like a Prayer\" video angered the Catholic church? Or the 1990s, when it seemed a camera couldn't turn her direction without capturing simulated masturbation? Then there was last year, when she had to backtrack after posting an Instagram photo of her son boxing, captioned with a take on the N-word. And in January, some took offense after she posted photos of civil rights icons altered to appear like the cover of her new album. Heck, this isn't even the the first time the singer has dissed a place where she grew up. In a 1987 interview with Jane Pauley, she called Bay City, Michigan, where she was born, a \"little smelly town in northern Michigan.\" A few moments later, Madonna followed up by saying she had \"great affection\" for the place. So far, no such love for Rochester Hills. Nor has the pop icon accepted the mayor's invite to return to her hometown for a visit.","highlights":"Madonna angers the Rochester Hills, Michigan, mayor by criticizing the town .\n\"I can't be around basic, provincial-thinking people,\" the singer said ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Lionel Messi has set the stage for a potentially season-defining week for Barcelona, scoring both goals as his team went four points clear at the top of the Spanish league on Saturday. The 2-0 win at tiny Eibar, a side playing in La Liga for the first time and which has now lost eight games in a row, may not seem like an unexpected achievement. But, with a European Champions League last-16 decider at home to Manchester City on Wednesday and then the \"El Clasico\" crunch clash with bitter rival Real Madrid next Sunday, every win is vital at this stage of the campaign. \"We're going into the Clasico as leaders and in perfect form,\" Barca coach Luis Enrique said. \"But first we have to focus on City because qualification is at stake. Then we'll see what happens at the weekend.\" Messi has now scored 43 goals this season, first netting a 31st-minute penalty after Borja Ekiza unluckily handled the Argentine's blocked shot and then bulleting in a header from Ivan Rakitic's corner 10 minutes after the restart. \"Eibar didn't look like a team that has just lost seven in a row,\" said Enrique, who welcomed back Brazil star Neymar from suspension to resume his role up front with Messi and Luis Suarez. \"They played good football and they fully deserved their great start to the season. I don't think they'll have any trouble avoiding relegation.\" The result puts even more pressure on second-placed Real Madrid to win Sunday's home clash with Levante. The European champion's coach Carlo Ancelotti has been criticized after a poor run of results since the turn of the year, while world-record signing Gareth Bale has particularly been vilified by national sports paper Marca following Tuesday's home defeat by Schalke. Real can take some small consolation in the fact that city rival Atletico Madrid could only draw 0-0 at Espanyol, meaning the defending champion stayed fourth in the table following Valencia's 2-0 win over Deportivo La Coruna on Friday. Atletico defender Miranda was sent off in time added on at the end of the first half for a foul on Abraham. Diego Simeone's side hosts German club Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday as it seeks to overturn a 1-0 deficit and seek to match last season's achievement of reaching the Champions League final. Barca, also looking to join Real in the quarterfinals, faces a City side reeling after Saturday's 1-0 defeat by relegation-threatened Burnley. It left Manuel Pellegrini's team five points behind English Premier League leader Chelsea, which has two games in hand ahead of Sunday's home clash with Southampton. \"We must continue to fight but the chances of winning the title are far as things stand,\" said Pellegrini, whose team must overcome a 2-1 deficit at the Nou Camp next week. \"There is still a chance, but it is more difficult after this result. We needed to create more chances than we did and find more space in and around their defense.\" The Chilean refused to blame the referee for not awarding what appeared to be a clear penalty for City in the dying minutes, when Pablo Zabaleta was brought down in the box. \"Was it a penalty? Maybe, but the referee decides these moments and I don't think that was the most important thing in this game,\" he said. \"The issue for us at present is that we are not winning the games that we normally do, especially against teams we are expected to beat, and that is because we are not scoring goals.\" City, seeking to retain its EPL title, is only one point ahead of third-placed Arsenal after Arsene Wenger's team won 3-0 at home to West Ham on Saturday. The London side has now won four games in all competitions since suffering a shock 3-1 home defeat by Wenger's former club Monaco in the first leg of their last-16 Champions League tie last month. \"We have to believe that we can do it,\" the Frenchman said of Tuesday's trip to the principality. \"This time Monaco are favorites so we have to go there, give absolutely everything and come out of the game with that feeling.\" Monaco moved up to fourth in the French league on Friday, beating nine-man Bastia 3-0 as Anthony Martial scored twice and Lavyin Kurzawa missed a penalty. Italian club Juventus, another side in Champions League action next week, went 14 points clear in Serie A with a 1-0 win at mid-table Palermo on Saturday. Spanish substitute Alvaro Morata ended Palermo's six-month unbeaten home run with a curling winner to maintain the Turin team's momentum ahead of Wednesday's trip to Borussia Dortmund. The German side, which trails 2-1 after the first leg thanks to goals from Morata and Carlos Tevez, drew 0-0 at home to Cologne Saturday to remain in mid-table after a second successive scoreless draw in the Bundesliga. Defending champion Bayern Munich moved 14 points clear at the top with a 4-0 win at Werder Bremen, as Poland striker Robert Lewandowski scored twice to add to his goal from the midweek Champions League thrashing of Shakhtar Donetsk. Thomas Muller, who netted twice in the 7-0 routing of the Ukrainian side, opened the scoring while David Alaba bagged the second goal. Third-placed Leverkusen, meanwhile, triumphed 4-0 over Stuttgart on Friday, with Josip Drmic scoring two. Wolfsburg, eight points ahead of Leverkusen, hosts second-bottom Freiburg on Sunday.

{"article":"Moscow  (CNN)This was supposed to be a rally led by Boris Nemtsov, had he lived two more days to see it. But after the Russian opposition figure was gunned down Friday night, Sunday's rally in Moscow took on a different theme. Instead of gathering to criticize Russia's policies on Ukraine, thousands of people came together to mourn the death of the former deputy prime minister. And as they united near the site of Nemtsov's death, conspiracy theories swirled over who killed the staunch critic of President Vladimir Putin as he walked near the Kremlin with his Ukrainian model companion. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko added fuel to the conspiracists' fire by saying Saturday that Nemtsov was about to reveal information that would be damaging to Russian interests, according to Ukrinform, the state-run news agency. \"A few weeks ago I had a conversation with him on how to build relations between Ukraine and Russia, as we would like them to be. Boris said that he was going to make public the strong evidence for participation of the Russian armed forces in Ukraine. Someone was very afraid of that. Boris was not afraid, the executioners were afraid. They killed him,\" Ukrinform quoted Poroshenko as saying. Russian authorities originally declined to issue a permit for the march when it was billed as an opposition rally. But they agreed to allow the procession honoring Nemtsov, said People's Freedom Party leader Mikhail Kasyanov. Nemtsov was a top official in the party. The 55-year-old was walking home from dinner with a companion, 23-year-old Anna Duritskaya, when he was killed. The model later called Ilya Yashin, a  friend and political colleague of Nemtsov's, and said several men had pulled up in a car, and one opened fire, Yashin said. Russian TV station LifeNews spoke with a snowplow driver, who witnessed the immediate aftermath of the slaying. He was identified as \"Sergey B.\" \"I got on the bridge, looked into the rear mirror and saw a man on the ground. I immediately realized he didn't feel well. I drove a little bit further and pulled over,\" the driver said. \"I realized we needed to call the ambulance and police.\" In a statement on its website, the Investigative Committee for the Russian Federation said the shooter likely used a Russian-made Makarov pistol and 9 mm shells were collected at the scene. Police say they are looking for a man with short hair who stands between 5-foot-7 and 5-foot-9, Russia's Sputnik news agency reported. The shooter was wearing blue jeans and a brown sweater. Several possible motives were being investigated, the committee said, including the prospect that the shooting was a \"provocation to destabilize the political situation in the country.\" The committee is also exploring the possibility that the killing is related to the Charlie Hebdo terror attack in Paris or Nemtsov's business activities, it said. The committee is offering a reward of 3 million rubles ($49,000) for information about the crime, several media outlets reported. Investigators interviewed Duritskaya, who was not wounded. She was reportedly being kept under guard at an apartment, and Ukraine's Foreign Ministry has requested that Duritskaya be allowed to return to Ukraine, according to TASS, a Russian news agency. Putin quickly condemned the killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate the shooting, the Kremlin said in a statement. The President also wrote to Nemtsov's mother saying he shared her grief and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice, the Kremlin said. But some of Nemtsov's fellow critics suspect involvement by either Putin's administration or a supporter of the President. \"It's clearly a political murder. It's definitely a contract one,\" Yashin said. \"I don't know who killed Boris, but I know that it's the government and personally Putin who are responsible for it. They've been constantly promoting a hatred towards everyone who doesn't support their course and thinks different.\" Putin had a different theory: that the killing was a contract hit, but one meant to fire up political strife, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Nemtsov himself had said he was at risk for assassination. He told the Russian newspaper Sobesednik last month that he was \"a little bit\" afraid his mother's fears Putin would have him killed would come true. But, he added, \"I'm not afraid of him that much. If I was afraid I wouldn't be heading an opposition party and do what I'm doing.\" Last year, Nemtsov spoke to CNN's Anthony Bourdain. \"I'm (a) well-known guy, and this is a safety because if something happens with me, it will be scandal not only in Moscow city but throughout the world,\" he said then. Critics of Putin have in the past suffered miserable fates. Last year, a Moscow court sentenced five men to prison for the 2006 killing of Russian journalist and fierce Kremlin critic Anna Politkovskaya. Business magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky accused Putin of corruption and spent 10 years in prison and labor camps. Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko accused state security services of organizing a coup to put Putin in power. He was poisoned by a lethal dose of radioactive polonium and died in London in 2006. No killer has been caught. And before his death, Nemtsov had been arrested several times for speaking against Putin's government. The most recent arrests were in 2011, when he protested the results of parliamentary elections, and in 2012, when tens of thousands protested against Putin. While Nemtsov certainly had his share of enemies in Russia -- especially those who disagree with his stance on the Ukrainian conflict --  many left notes for the slain politician on the bridge where he was killed. \"To Boris Nemtsov,\" one letter read, \"Thank you for your example of courage and honesty.\" Human rights activists did not mince words in assigning blame for Nemtsov's murder. Tweeted Garry Kasparov, chairman of the Human Rights Foundation's International Council: \"If you are popular your critics don't have to be shot down in front of the Kremlin. Putin is just food in a prison, eat it or starve.\" In a column on how Nemtsov had been harassed for his regular criticism of the Kremlin, Human Rights Watch's Tanya Cooper lambasted Peskov, the Putin spokesman, for saying the killing appeared to be an attempt to destabilize Russia -- a statement Cooper said could prejudice the investigation. \"Russia has become the kind of place where a top opposition leader can be murdered just steps away from the president's office,\" she wrote. \"A country in which people are told to hate one another for difference of opinions is a dangerous country to live in.\" Frederik Pleitgen and Alla Eshchenko reported from Moscow; Holly Yan and Eliott C. McLaughlin reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Matthew Chance in Moscow and Laura Smith-Spark in London contributed to this report.","highlights":"Ukraine's president says Boris Nemtsov was about to release information .\nRussia: Authorities are searching for the killer of staunch Putin critic .\nHe was supposed to lead a rally Sunday against Russia's policies on Ukraine ."}
{"article":"Tunis (CNN)The bodies of four Italian tourists slain in a terror attack on Tunisia's Bardo Museum three days ago arrived back in Italy on Saturday, an official with the Tunis Crisis Center told CNN, but 14 victims' remains still lie in the morgue. As Tunisia gets back on its feet, the investigation into Wednesday's shooting at the Tunis landmark continues. Most of the 23 victims were foreigners, making the process of identification more complicated. Nineteen of them were tourists who'd been on two cruise ships that docked in Tunis. French, Spanish, Italian, British, Japanese, Russian and Colombian citizens are among those to have been formally identified so far. The bodies of the Italians were met in Rome by Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who paid his respects to the victims and their families in a brief ceremony. Eleven people who were injured in the attack remained in the hospital in Tunisia on Saturday, the official at the Tunis Crisis Center said. Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid identified two suspects in the attack, Yassine Labidi and Saber Khachnaou, in an interview with French radio station RTL on Thursday, though it wasn't immediately clear if they were the pair killed at the museum by Tunisian security forces. He said Yassine was \"known to the security services, he was flagged and monitored,\" but not known or being followed for anything special. Authorities have arrested nine people in connection with the attack, including four directly linked to it, according to a statement from Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi. An uncle of Yassine Labidi, Abeld Malik Labidi, told CNN on Friday that no one he knew had seen any signs of extremism in his 26-year-old nephew. But he said Yassine Labidi was one of the two gunmen killed at the museum. \"It's true that Yassine carried out this terrorist attack, he was killed; his head, his body, we don't have it back,\" he said. But, he said, he believed Yassine and other young Tunisians like him were also victims of terrorism -- of the recruiters who paid them money, organized the logistics and took them to places like Syria and Libya to train as fighters. He had known his nephew well, he said. \"After the revolution of 2011 he started to pray, before he would drink beers from time to time, like a young Tunisian. He wasn't extreme in any way.\" The only thing that raised questions was that Yassine had disappeared for about a month, he said. Although his nephew said he'd gone to the Tunisian city of Sfax to work, his family now suspected he had been in Libya because of the phone numbers he called from. \"When he came back his behavior was the same: he was still himself, calm, serious. Nobody noticed anything, even the neighbors I spoke to,\" said Abeld Malik Labidi. \"He said hello to everyone, he prayed, he took his coffee, even on the day of the attack he took his coffee with his family and went to work.\" Abeld Malik Labidi said Yassine's father, sister and brother had undergone lengthy interrogations by anti-terror police since the attack. Officers had seized his nephew's computer and phone, as well as taking samples of his fingerprints, he said. A cousin of Yassine, who asked not to be named, told CNN that the family was shocked by what had happened. \"We are all shocked, we lost someone even if what he did was wrong, may God forgive him. Those he killed were innocent, why would you go and harm Australians or Japanese ... our Islam doesn't mention about killing people, Islam has never been this,\" he said. He also said he had no idea how his cousin had been radicalized, saying he was \"a normal Tunisian guy ... but not an extremist.\" Security Minister Rafik Chelly said on Friday that the two extremists who attacked the museum got weapons training at camps in Libya. The suspects were activated from sleeper cells in Tunisia, he said. He did not say which group activated them, or with whom they trained. \"They left the country illegally last December for Libya, and they were able to train with weapons there,\" he told private broadcaster AlHiwar Ettounsi TV. Like Tunisia, Libya saw its longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi ousted during the regional wave of revolutions known as the Arab Spring. But unlike its neighbor to the west, Libya has been fraught with more instability and violence -- much of it perpetrated by Islamist militants. In an audio message posted online Thursday, ISIS claimed responsibility for Wednesday's attack, which it said targeted \"crusaders and apostates\" with \"automatic weapons and hand grenades.\" CNN cannot independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement. That bloodshed is \"just the start,\" the ISIS message warned -- a threat that may or may not be hollow, but nonetheless adds extra urgency for Tunisian investigators.

{"article":"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN)A siege that started with gunmen detonating a bomb and spraying bullets in a hotel in Somalia ended Saturday with at least 20 people dead, authorities said. Among the dead was a Somali-American woman, Fahia Bashir Nur, 45, of Alexandria, Virginia, according to her uncle, Yusuf Kheire. He said Nur and her mother were dining in the hotel when the attack began. The mother lost an arm in the attack and was hospitalized. The attack, which lasted hours, began when gunmen raided the hotel in Mogadishu on Friday evening. Yusuf Mohamed Ismail Bari-Bari, Somalia's permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, was among those killed in the attack, the Somali government said. \"He will be remembered for his strong personal commitment to protecting and promoting human rights for all,\" Nicholas Kay, special representative of the United Nations Secretary-General to Somalia, said of Bari-Bari. Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility. The attack started about 5 p.m. local time when a car bomb exploded at the hotel's entrance, according to witness Aden Hussein, who said he was nearby when the blast happened. Gunmen then stormed into the hotel and opened fire, Hussein said. They overpowered the hotel's security guards, said police Capt. Ahmed Abdi, adding that the gunbattle between Somali special forces and the attackers lasted at least 17 hours. One of the attackers, who was wearing a belt with explosives, blew himself up inside the hotel, police Capt. Ahmed Abdi said. Some members of the terror group \"stormed into the first, second and third floors of the hotel where rooms are located and held several people hostage,\" according to a statement from the African Union Commission in Somalia, a peacekeeping mission. The Makka Al Mukarama hotel, located along a highway leading to the country's presidential palace, is popular with lawmakers, journalists, business people and Somalis returning home from abroad. Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud condemned the attack as a \"heinous and inhuman act\" in an interview with state-run Radio Mogadishu during an official visit to Egypt. In a statement, Somali Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke said Al-Shabaab's \"talk of 'legitimate targets' and 'justification'\" exposes \"the sham logic behind their lust for terror.\" \"These terrorists contradict Islam and betray Somalia,\" he said. The injured, along with the bodies of the dead, could not be removed from the hotel until after the hours-long gunfight. More than 10 people, most of them Kenyan nationals who worked at the hotel, were rescued, police said. Al-Shabaab said it targeted the hotel because its guests are spies and government officials. The terror group has been active in Somalia for years. Initially, its goal was implementing a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia, by warring against the Somali government. It has since shifted its focus to launching terror attacks in Somalia and beyond. \"We reiterate again that there will be no safe haven for the crusaders and apostates in Somalia, and that our attacks on them will continue until the enemy of Allah (is) defeated and his law is implemented fully in Somalia,\" the group said in a statement. CNN's Faith Karimi wrote from Atlanta, and Journalist Omar Nor reported from Mogadishu.

{"article":"Hong Kong (CNN)A 16-year-old teenager has been charged for a tirade he posted on YouTube regarding the death of the late Singapore leader, Lee Kuan Yew. Amos Yee, a moppy-haired teenager posted an online video peppered with expletives that slammed the late leader, who died last week, as a \"horrible person\" and \"undoubtedly totalitarian.\" He also made comments comparing Lee to Jesus Christ and Mao Zedong. Lee, highly revered in Singapore was buried Sunday with thousands gathering in a massive state funeral service. While admired for his role turning the former British colony into a financial power house, Lee was also criticized for tamping down on free speech in Singapore. On the day of Lee's funeral, Yee was arrested after Singapore police said it received more than 20 reports regarding his video, which police said contained \"disparaging remarks against Christians.\" That YouTube video has since been removed. Critics say Yee's arrest highlights the restrictions on free speech in Singapore. The Committee to Protect Journalists called for the teen's immediate release. Yee faces three charges: intent to wound the religious feelings of any person; circulating obscene objects; and making threatening and abusive or insulting communications. He could face up to three years in prison. Deputy Commissioner of Police Tan Chye Hee said: \"Police take a stern view of acts that could threaten religious harmony in Singapore. Any person who uploads offensive content online with deliberate intention of wounding the religious or racial feelings of any person will be firmly dealt with in accordance with the law.\" The Strait Times newspaper reported that Yee's bail was set at $14,500 and that Yee's father apologized to Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is the son of Lee Kuan Yew.","highlights":"Singapore teenager arrested over comments about late leader in YouTube video .\nCriticisms over jailing teenager and restriction on freedom of speech ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Two Chinese men have been jailed for selling military intelligence, including hundreds of photos of China's first aircraft carrier, to foreign spies, state media reported. According to the Dalian Daily, the two men, surnamed Han and Zhang, were sentenced to eight and six years in prison respectively earlier this year. The report said that Han, 30, was approached by a person claiming to be a journalist via the instant messaging app WeChat. The \"reporter\" assigned Han to work in a military base, taking photos of \"sensitive areas\" of a major military project with his phone in the name of news gathering. Last summer, he traveled to Beijing and Liaoning, in China's northeast, to take photos, including images of exhibits at a national defense technology promotion show. He later passed recordings and photos to his \"employer,\" the report said. \"Although the enemies' tricks are cunning, they are totally preventable,\" the paper said. When contacted by CNN, Dalian's Public Security Bureau confirmed the media report was correct but declined to give further details. The other man, Zhang, 23, had sent more than 500 pictures of the Liaoning aircraft carrier, named after the province where it was refitted, to a person who claimed to be an editor with a foreign magazine before being detained last August. Two months earlier, Zhang had quit his original job for this better-paid side job, the paper said. The paper published photographs of their \"spying equipment\" -- iPhones, computers and cables. Some Internet users questioned whether it was really espionage to take photos of China's aircraft carrier --  even former U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel visited the vessel in 2014. \"I have photos of the aircraft carrier, too,\" one person with the handle @gablio posted on Weibo, China's equivalent to Twitter. \"When I flew from Dalian to Beijing two years ago, I saw the vessel clearly on the plane.

{"article":"Minnie Minoso, who hit a two-run home run in his first at-bat when he became major league baseball's first black player in Chicago in 1951, has died, the Cook County medical examiner said Sunday. The medical examiner's office did not immediately offer further details. There is some question about Minoso's age but the White Sox say he was 90. Minoso played 12 of his 17 seasons in Chicago, hitting .304 with 135 homers and 808 RBIs for the White Sox. The White Sox retired his No. 9 in 1983 and there is a statue of Minoso at U.S. Cellular Field. Remembered: Minnie Minoso (seen here in August 2013), who became major league baseball's first black player in Chicago in 1951, has died . History: In a March 9, 1957 file photo, Chicago White Sox outfielder Orestes 'Minnie' Minoso poses in batting position at Al Lopez Field in Tampa, Florida . Starting out:\u00a0Minoso made his major league debut with Cleveland in 1949 and was dealt to Chicago in a three-team trade two years later. Minoso is seen with Lou Boudreau, right, and Larry Doby (on the left) in May 1949 . 'We have lost our dear friend and a great man,' White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf said in a release. 'Many tears are falling.' Minoso made his major league debut with Cleveland in 1949 and was dealt to Chicago in a three-team trade two years later. He made his White Sox debut on May 1, 1951, and homered in his first plate appearance against Yankees right-hander Vic Raschi. It was the start of a beautiful relationship between the Cuban slugger and the White Sox. Minoso, regarded as baseball's first black Latino star, was a Havana native who spent most of his career in left field. He is one of only two players to appear in a major league game in five different decades. He got his final hit in 1976 at age 53 and went 0 for 2 in two games in 1980 for the White Sox, who tried unsuccessfully over the years to get the 'Cuban Comet' into baseball's Hall of Fame. 'When I watched Minnie Minoso play, I always thought I was looking at a Hall of Fame player,' Reinsdorf said in an informational package produced by the team for a 2011 Cooperstown push. 'I never understood why Minnie wasn't elected. 'He did everything. He could run, he could field, he could hit with power, he could bunt and steal bases. He was one of the most exciting players I have ever seen.' Saturnino Orestes Armas Minoso Arrieta was selected for nine All-Star games and won three Gold Gloves in left. He was hit by a pitch 192 times, ninth on baseball's career list, and finished in the top four in AL MVP voting four times. Despite the push by the White Sox and other prominent Latin players, Minoso has never made it to Cooperstown. His highest percentage during his 15 years on the writers' ballot was 21.1 in 1988. He was considered by the Veterans Committee in 2014 and fell short of the required percentage for induction. 'My last dream is to be in Cooperstown, to be with those guys,' Minoso said in that 2011 package distributed by the White Sox. 'I want to be there. This is my life's dream.' Minoso, who made his major league debut with Cleveland in 1949, hit .298 for his career with 186 homers and 1,023 RBIs. The speedy Minoso also led the AL in triples and steals three times in each category. Playing in an era dominated by the Yankees, Minoso never played in the postseason. 'Every young player in Cuba wanted to be like Minnie Minoso, and I was one of them,' Hall of Fame slugger Tony Perez said. 'The way he played the game, hard all the time, hard. He was very consistent playing the game. He tried to win every game. And if you want to be like somebody, and I picked Minnie, you have to be consistent.' Minoso appeared in just nine games in his first stint with the Indians, but he took off when he was dealt to Chicago as part of a three-team trade in 1951 that also involved the Philadelphia Athletics. He went deep in his first plate appearance against Yankees right-hander Raschi, and hit .375 in his first 45 games with the White Sox. Tribute: The White Sox shared an image of Minoso on Twitter Sunday (left). Flowers have also been left at his statue at U.S. Cellular Field (right) Minoso finished that first season in Chicago with a .326 batting average, 10 homers and 76 RBIs in 146 games for the Indians and White Sox. He also had a major league-best 14 triples and an AL-best 31 steals. It was Minoso's first of eight seasons with at least a .300 batting average. He also had four seasons with at least 100 RBIs. 'I have baseball in my blood,' Minoso said. 'Baseball is all I've ever wanted to do.' The White Sox uploaded a photograph of Minoso smiling and holding his jersey to the team'sTwitter on Sunday. 'Minnie Minoso \u2014 Mr. #WhiteSox \u2014 has died. Tears of sadness are falling for a great man,' the caption said.

{"article":"(CNN)Congratulations, Internet haters! Well done, keepers of the one-true-way-to-talk-about-race! If we don't tamp down the backlash against Starbucks \"Race Together\" campaign, I fear that no major corporation will even try to talk about race again -- for maybe 10 or 20 years. Is that really what we want? Look, I get it. Asking baristas to hold conversations about race is a lot to demand of already hard-working employees. Not to mention, the topic should probably be called \"systematic racism,\" not just \"race.\" And there are legitimate questions about what Starbucks could realistically hope to accomplish, here. But for crying out loud! In the past 48 hours, racial justice activists have spilled more digital ink criticizing Starbucks for trying to fight racism than they have against other (actually racist) companies. The truth is that we cannot have it both ways. We cannot demand that companies address race, and then attack them when they try. Yes, it seems like harmless fun to pile on or retweet the snark. At some point, all of us have enjoyed the cheap thrill one gets by kicking around a big company online. But the cost this time is that no corporation will want to do anything creative or constructive on racial subjects for a very long time. In fact, some activists are responding with such little sympathy, empathy and grace, that other corporations are like to run the other way. Again, is that what we want? Mellody Hobson, an African-American member of the Starbucks board and a personal friend, is a major supporter of this campaign. How will other corporate boards react in the future when a minority member encourages the company to publicly address issues of racial inclusion? Starbucks is trying to make a positive difference. If the company gets rewarded, others will follow. But nobody wants their brand to get beaten up. At some point in the future, activists will launch an online petition or protest against a company guilty of some legitimately racist behavior. But how seriously will anyone take us, when even the \"good guys\" end up getting kicked in the teeth and called racist -- for trying to OPPOSE bigotry? Modern science tells us that bias lives on, in even the most dedicated anti-racist. The only cure is talking about it. Our country needs more open discussion of race, not less. Companies who try to further that discussion should be rewarded, even if their initial attempts are imperfect. We can put forward suggestions and criticisms in a constructive manner: \"This is a great first step, Corporation! Here are five ways to improve the campaign -- and make it even better.\" I think any human anywhere would be open to hearing that kind of feedback. But nobody wants to be called an idiot, just for trying. Unfortunately, today's vicious backlash against Starbucks could become a case study in proving that -- when it comes to race -- no good deed goes unpunished. Ironically, after all this is over, Starbucks will still sell plenty of lattes. The people who will suffer the most are the ones who said they wanted a conversation on race in the first place -- but then wouldn't take \"yes\" for an answer.","highlights":"Starbucks was trashed by many online for its \"Race Together\" initiative .\nVan Jones: What kind of lesson will this have for other companies that try to do the right thing?"}
{"article":"(CNN)A swarm of insects tends to startle us -- chaotic yet organized, fascinating and beautiful. Take it one step further. Instead of bees hovering around a tree, imagine cheese balls. Solo cups in the place of birds, glow sticks as locusts. What seems like a figment of a wild imagination becomes reality in Thomas Jackson's \"Emergent Behavior\" series. Jackson grew up in Rhode Island and worked in publishing in New York for 13 years, ultimately landing his dream gig as an editor with Forbes magazine. But somewhere along the way, he picked up a camera. He found photography \"effortlessly fulfilling\" compared to the frequent challenges of writing. So he dove in, lens first. After a charming series featuring a robot, he struck a cadence in creating \"swarms\" with inanimate objects such as Post-it notes and plastic plates. \"I started creating these whimsical, fantastic scenarios in which the environment is exploiting us,\" Jackson explained. That's what initially catches the eye -- the uncanny. The bizarre gathering in the behavior of insects or birds, made up of something that shouldn't be there. At first, he relied on digital enhancements to polish his illusions. But as the series evolved, he relied less on editing and more on the installations themselves. More than half of Jackson's \"Emergent Behavior\" series is digitally untouched. How Jackson gets a tubful of cheese balls to hang purposefully around the trunk of a tree seems nonsensical. He only hints at the mechanics. It's just \"wires,\" he said, casually, not revealing enough evidence to ruin the magic. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. \"But if you look close enough, it will reveal all of its secrets.\" He spends about a day building the installations, and he usually shoots his photos at dusk. The photo of the pink Solo cups was shot against mountainous terrain in Wyoming. The cups, already at odds with nature, look as though they are a flock of birds flying along the rocks. Jackson seemingly casts a magic spell of manic movement, creating what an Internet commentator calls \"a frat party being sucked into a black hole.\" The idea of a swarm -- be it insects or \"thank you\" bags -- fascinates Jackson. They are disconcerting and familiar at once, creating a conundrum that warrants a closer look. \"Maybe because they fly in the face of how we see the world,\" he said.

But I don\u2019t think anybody has had it since then. The Scottish players have been unbelievably good. They\u2019ve not dived but if they do (like Connolly) it should be the same rules. \u2018Is it the fault of the ref or the player they got a penalty? It\u2019s both.

We have a rule where people look at things afterwards but I don\u2019t see anybody else getting suspensions.\u2019 Celtic defender Virgil van Dyke (right) was sent off after only nine minutes of the Scottish Cup quarter-final .

There was some kicking of each other to get off each other. It was nothing. 'Hopefully everybody can play in the next game. Will we appeal? We will see.

It is fantastic. That\u2019s why we love football. We are fighting for big things, trophies, and we have to keep our discipline. But the pitch made it a fight today. It was nothing about playing football.

This is actually what I signed up for when I uploaded my video to the CNN Fit  Nation website in December. \"But climbing mountains on Sunday morning -- you got to be kidding me,\" I exclaimed. But it was all part of the process I realized I was going to take on as I learn how to be a triathlete. After our first initial week with a trainer and nutritionist, the six of us were introduced to a whole new way of how to approach fitness and how to incorporate it into our lives. I knew it was going to be a difficult task, especially for someone like me heavily involved in civic affairs and community service. At Lifetime Fitness, our nutritionist walked us through a number of exercises on how we should look at food, nutrition and our calorie intake. After being on several diets over my lifetime, what he said was simple. To look and review your intake and replace it with other foods such as fruit and vegetables -- these small steps can be major impact on your training. Tackling nutrition and calorie intake can also be exactly how I viewed the climb up Stone Mountain. I put these nutritional issues on the backburner for years. It was pretty much like looking at the mountain that I was about to climb that morning -- where do I start, where do I begin? -- and telling myself that it was going to be an arduous task. My training schedule has also been an uphill battle. In January and the first weeks of February, I started strong with my gym, running and swim workouts. However, as life pressures got in the way, I saw myself withering off. But luckily I have been inspired by my 2015 CNN Fit Nation teammates to keep me on track. Their updates have been truly inspiring and have helped me think about the struggles I face in my training activities. As I get older, I realize that fitness and nutrition are key to long-term health; however, the support of friends and family is also important to help tackle your health. My team members of the CNN Fit Nation have been there for me. I recently weighed myself when I visited the doctor's office. It has been six weeks since I hit the scale. I actually lost 20 pounds. What! Really! Uphill battles are hard to see when you are in the middle of them. But you keep moving. Just like that Sunday afternoon in January, I could not wait to be on the mountaintop and see the view from Stone Mountain with the members of 2015 CNN Fit Nation. And guess what? After all this huffing and puffing over the last six weeks, I can't wait to see the view in September at the Malibu triathlon. It's just another uphill mountain to climb.","highlights":"George \"Chip\" Greenidge Jr. says training schedule has been an uphill battle .\nSince joining Fit Nation team, Greenidge has lost 20 pounds ."}
{"article":"Former England captain Michael Vaughan has challenged Kevin Pietersen to prove he wants to play for England by turning his back on the Indian Premier League and playing county cricket. Pietersen was axed from the England set-up in February last year in the aftermath of the 5-0 Ashes series defeat to Australia, but was given hope of a possible return by incoming chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, Colin Graves. Graves said in a recent BBC Radio 5 Sportsweek interview that Pietersen, who left Surrey last autumn, has to play county cricket if he harbours any hopes of an England return and Vaughan agrees with this viewpoint. There have been calls for Kevin Pietersen to return to the England fold following World Cup struggles . Former England captain Michael Vaughan has challenged Pietersen to prove his loyalty by playing county cricket next summer instead of chasing the big dollars in T20 tournaments . 'You say it for a while you want to play for England - prove it!' he told BBC Radio 5 Live. 'Give up your IPL deal, go and play for, say, Surrey - freezing cold away at Derby.' Vaughan added: 'If Kevin is going to do exactly what he's been saying and he's desperate to play (for England), he will play county cricket and I will pretty much guarantee that he will score plenty of runs doing it.' Pietersen was in optimistic mood on Monday that an unlikely reconciliation may be achieved, tweeting: 'Incredibly humbling how supportive you've all been since the news broke yesterday from Mr Colin Graves. Gonna try work this out for sure!' Indications since Graves' interview appear to have been broadly less encouraging for the exiled 34-year-old batsman, however, who was bought by Sunrisers Hyderabad for the upcoming IPL season in February. Pietersen hits out for his county Surrey during a NatWest T20 Blast match with Middlesex last summer . Pietersen has recently been playing for the Melbourne Stars in the Australian Big Bash league . Incoming chairman of the ECB, Colin Graves, also called on Pietersen to prove his form in county cricket . The ECB issued a statement on Sunday evening, insisting 'nothing has changed' in his status and adding 'only players who are playing consistent high-quality county cricket and who are seen as a positive influence will be selected for England'. Surrey de-registered Pietersen at the end of last season, and are not publicly inclined to reopen negotiations. Chairman Richard Thompson said: 'Our understanding at the end of last summer was that Pietersen had no intention of playing red-ball cricket. 'If not, he will not play for Surrey.'

There was little engagement in the topic from Pietersen's former team-mate Joe Root who - along with his current colleagues - has more pressing issues to confront in Australia and New Zealand as England try to stay in the World Cup after three defeats in four matches so far. Root told the BBC: 'We're in the middle of the World Cup, and stuff like that is completely irrelevant to us.'","highlights":"Michael Vaughan said Kevin Pietersen must prove he wants England return .\nHe's urged KP to quit the Indian Premier League and play county games .\nECB chairman Colin Graves made same remarks at the weekend .\nPietersen was axed following England's disastrous Ashes last winter ."}
{"article":"(CNN)An Iraqi man watching his first snowfall in his new American hometown was shot and killed by an unknown assailant, according to Dallas police. Authorities have stepped up patrols in the neighborhood where Ahmed Al-Jumaili lived -- and died -- in their effort to find out who killed the 36-year-old early Thursday, as he and his brother stood in the parking lot of his apartment complex watching the snow. Al-Jumaili's wife was with them taking photos. Dallas police spokesman Jeff Cotner said Al-Jumaili, who recently immigrated to the U.S., had never seen snow and \"just like all of us, a pretty snowfall brings the child out in us.\" There is \"extreme heartache ... and no shortage of sadness for this beautiful young man who had just come to this country 20 days ago,\" said Alia Salem, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in the Dallas and Fort Worth area. CAIR became involved in the case immediately after the shooting, according to Salem, because of \"a heightened sense of awareness with regard to hate crimes against Muslims.\" Salem said the Muslim community wanted to know whether the shooting death was random or whether  Al-Jumaili was targeted. Police say they have no indication so far that it was a hate crime. When shooting broke out, Al-Jumaili cried \"I'm hit!\" according to Cotner, basing that on statements from witnesses and the victim's relatives. He ran to his apartment nearby and died a few hours later. Police did not say where Al-Jumaili was struck or how many times he was shot. Some residents reported seeing two to four men enter the apartment complex on foot through a vehicle gate before the shooting, according to Cotner. He said there was no interaction between the men and Al-Jumaili and his family. In black-and-white soundless surveillance video, one person who appears to be carrying a rifle is seen running just ahead of a second person, Dallas police Officer Monica Cordova said. The second person is shown walking at a slower pace, holding what appears to be a handgun in his right hand. Approximately 13 seconds later, another person comes into view and passes by the camera, followed by a fourth individual who is walking, she said. From the vantage point of the camera, it is difficult to make out any of the features of the suspects or even the gender, although police have said they are looking for four black males. Witnesses say multiple shots were fired from what is believed to be a rifle. Cotner said police are conducting tests to find out whether more than one rifle was used in the shooting, but he said he could not reveal the make or model of the weapon. Cotner said Friday that other than that, police have little to go on. \"We can't solve this crime alone,\" he said. Authorities are appealing to the public to contact them with any information that might help the investigation. North Texas Crime Stoppers is offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and an indictment, police said. Salem is encouraging anyone with information about the shooting to share it. She said there are online campaigns underway to help raise funds for the family's expenses, as well as an effort to raise additional funds to contribute to the reward. CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","highlights":"Dallas police say Ahmed Al-Jumaili was killed by shot from a rifle, but they aren't revealing what type .\nAuthorities say shooting does not appear to be a hate crime, but that hasn't been ruled out ."}

{"article":"The 'phenomenal success' of the recent Davis Cup tie in Glasgow shows the huge appetite for tennis in Scotland and highlights the massive opportunity which exists to grow the sport, according to Judy Murray. The Great Britain Fed Cup captain said neither she nor her sons, Andy and Jamie, had ever experienced an atmosphere like the one at the Emirates Arena at the weekend, where Great Britain beat the US to line up a World Group quarter-final home tie against France. Coming after a huge year for sport in 2014 - in which Scotland hosted the Commonwealth Games and golf's Ryder Cup - Judy Murray believes there has never been a better time to capitalise on the 'buzz' about the sport she has worked to promote for 25 years. Judy Murray says success of the recent Davis Cup tie in Glasgow shows  huge appetite for tennis in Scotland . Great Britain's team celebrate their 3-2 victory over the USA at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow . But she stressed that good public facilities and a workforce of people who can enthuse others and bring on talent are essential if tennis is to continue to grow north of border. 'There is talent everywhere in the country, but talent without opportunity doesn't come to anything,' she said. Murray was speaking as she prepared to address about 300 young people interested in exploring a career in sports development or coaching at the Dundee Academy of Sport, a project led by Abertay University. The talk included her reflections on her rise from being a volunteer coach in Dunblane to working at tennis's elite level with her sons and the GB women's team. Andy Murray celebrates during his  win over John Isner that clinched the Brits a quarter-final place . She says it shows  huge appetite for tennis in Scotland and highlights  massive opportunity for sport to grow . Speaking ahead of the event, she said: 'I was a young mum when I started out volunteering at our local club and we had no track record of success in tennis in Scotland - in fact, we had very little tennis in Scotland and no indoor courts when I started out. 'Now there is a massive, massive opportunity to capitalise on the buzz about tennis that's been created by Andy and Jamie's success, and of course I really want to try to grow the game up here.' Former Wimbledon champion Andy Murray sealed the Davis Cup quarter-final place for Great Britain at the weekend with a straight-sets win over American John Isner. 'The Davis Cup was a phenomenal success,' said Judy Murray. 'The atmosphere at the Emirates Arena was incredible, there was about 8,000 people there. I've never seen anything like it and Andy and Jamie said they'd never played in an atmosphere like that. Murray was quick to stress that Scotland was full of talent but it needed to be nurtured in the right way . James Ward acknowledges the crowd after being forced off injured during day three of the Davis Cup . 'You can see there's a huge appetite for it in Scotland, and for tennis it's the perfect time to capitalise.' She added: 'For them to play it in Scotland was very, very special. I think it was the first time Andy had played in Scotland since he won his Grand Slams. He found it very emotional. 'I think he gets fantastic support from Scotland, but he's rarely in the country to feel it because when he does something big or is in a big final, obviously he's not here. 'I think when he walked out and heard that roar, it was goosebumps for him.' Murray said it is a 'huge time for sport' following a major 2014 for Scotland. She said: 'I think last year with the Commonwealth Games and the Ryder Cup - massive events in our country, run extremely successfully and extremely popular - and with what we saw last weekend at the Emirates, we have a lot of role models in Scotland and it is the perfect time to invest in sport and physical activity.' One of the Academy's aims is to develop the region's workforce by providing training and professional development to those working in the leisure industry. The importance of growing an accomplished sporting workforce and encouraging more women to think about careers in sport are also topics close to Murray's heart. Andy Murray watches on while his brother Jamie serves (left) and the GB team discuss tactics (right) She believes Andy Murray is a brilliant example of the talent Scotland has from a country with no track record . She said: 'Andy and Jamie were just two wee boys from a local club in Dunblane, in a country where there was no track record of tennis, who went on to both win Grand Slam titles. 'I think what that shows is that anything is possible if you have the talent, somebody creates the opportunity and then you work your socks off to get as far as you can. But we've got to believe and we've got to be ambitious. 'Nothing is impossible. Don't accept mediocre.

{"article":"(CNN)As a manager at several prominent media outlets, Katharine Zaleski did not understand the demands on working moms and often belittled their work ethic. Then she became a mom, and everything changed. In a widely shared piece this week for Fortune.com, the journalist-turned-startup executive apologizes for disparaging the mothers she worked with in her 20s at the Huffington Post and Washington Post. Zaleski said she committed multiple \"infractions,\" against these women, including scheduling late-afternoon meetings or happy hours without considering that mothers with after-work responsibilities wouldn't be able to attend. She even didn't disagree \"when another female editor said we should hurry up and fire another woman before she 'got pregnant.' \" Now a mother to a young daughter, Zaleski said she was wrong to undervalue mothers' contributions by counting hours logged in the office and not the actual work done. \"I wish I had known five years ago, as a young, childless manager, that mothers are the people you need on your team,\" she wrote. \"There's a saying that 'if you want something done then ask a busy person to do it.' That's exactly why I like working with mothers now.\" Zaleski's piece has been shared more than 1,000 times and has been hailed on social media by many commenters who applaud her for seeing the error of her ways. \"Your message is so important and it's about time it was addressed,\" said Heather Bouvier on Twitter. \"THANK YOU for writing this. There are so many people like your then-childless 28-year-old self who need to read it. Seriously, thank you from the bottom of my heart,\" wrote Alice Gomstyn on Facebook. Since the essay was published Tuesday, Zaleski told CNN she's received more than 2,000 emails from readers who admit they've committed similar infractions in the workplace. \"I'm so motivated and thrilled,\" she said.  \"I couldn't be more psyched for the responses.\" But not all the responses have been positive. Some people refuse to accept Zaleski's apology and accuse her of borrowing from similar apologetic essays by other new moms. \"This woman has basically stolen another woman's post about her views on mothers with children in the workforce for her own personal gain!!,\" wrote one commenter on Zaleski's essay. Others accuse Zaleski of writing the essay just to promote the new company she co-founded, Power to Fly, an online platform that matches women with technical skills to freelance projects they can do from anywhere. \"This woman & her shameless self-promoting article disgust me. No awareness. No integrity,\" Kitten Holiday said on Twitter. Zaleski said that notion is \"just silly,\" and she's taken a huge risk leaving a stable job to start a company that is a part of the solution. Zaleski said her company, which launched in August, enables women to work from home so that they can \"be valued for their productivity and not time spent sitting in an office or at a bar bonding afterwards.\" But some critics say encouraging mothers to work from home only perpetuates a problem. \"I like this article a lot, but wish the solution wasn't to have a company that helps mothers find jobs that keep them tucked away at home, but to change the dominant culture to create better, more supportive workplaces where flexible schedules are encouraged,\" said Suzanne Pekow Carlson on Facebook. Others say they wish Zaleski went further, and instead of only addressing the challenges of the working mother, wished she'd included other caregivers, like dads. \"I hope the convo ... expands beyond just working moms to working dads, folks taking care of sick parents, etc.,\" ABC's Karen Travers said on Twitter. \"I don't understand why we still refuse to acknowledge that our society needs to be more flexible for PARENTS. It is not just the woman's burden,\" said Margaret Weingart Berger on Facebook. And said another commenter on Zaleski's essay, \"If it takes this woman becoming a mother to understand the value of working mothers and have compassion for them, then I guess we can't expect men to understand and have compassion because they will never be able to be mothers themselves.\" Zaleski said she finds the criticism \"frustrating,\" but said she refuses to dwell on the negative.  She wants to \"stay focused on helping women find fulfilling work they can do from home.\" She said her essay represents her \"own personal experience,\" which happens to mostly involve working with mothers. But she's glad her piece has opened a dialogue and she hopes the conversation continues. Women not supporting women \"is a systemic problem in our society,\" Zaleski said. Serena Markstrom Nugent, posting on Facebook, agreed. \"To the women mad at her (Zaleski) and saying too little too late: She not only had not had kids but was very young and ambitious. In the spirit of not tearing down other women, I would say cheer her on for where she is on in the journey,\" she wrote. \"Still young, still learning, and at least at this point, it appears, part of the solution.\" Still other critics suggest the issue isn't as simple as parents versus non-parents in the workplace.

{"article":"An incredible finish produced two stoppage-time goals as Norwich came from behind for a second time to rescue a point. No sooner had James Vaughan put Huddersfield 2-1 in front than Canaries substitute Jamar Loza plundered a point with almost the last kick. Both goals came from close range. Vaughan was stupidly sent off after his, taking off his shirt in celebration to pick up a second yellow card within moments of each other. Jamar Loza celebrates after scoring an equaliser six minutes into injury time for Norwich City . Earlier, a goal disallowed after it had been awarded - and an amazing miss - beset Norwich in their top two challenge. But they rallied to challenge strongly for all three at one stage. Bradley Johnson was cautioned for handling the ball into the Huddersfield after referee Nigel Miller had signalled a goal from the Canaries first serious attack. Late in the first half Gary Hooper somehow failed to make clean contact with the ball, let alone bury a sitter from six yards. The young striker fires home after Graham Dorrans' original effort was saved by Alex Smithies . Huddersfield: Smithies; Smith, Hudson (c), Lynch, Scannell; Hogg, Coady, Butterfield, Carroll (Edgar - 70); Miller (Gobern - 78), Vaughan . Subs not used:\u00a0Murphy, Wallace, Holmes, Charles, Majewski . Booked:\u00a0Lynch . Red Card: Vaughan 95 . Goals: Miller 54, Vaughan 95 . Norwich: Ruddy; Whittaker, Martin (c), Bassong, Olsson; Redmond, Howson (Loza - 87), Dorrans, Johnson (Hoolahan - 67); Hooper (Andreu - 78), Jerome . Subs not used: Rudd, Cuellar, Tettey, Odjidja-Ofoe . Booked: Johnson, Martin, Loza . Goals: Hoolahan 67, Loza 96 . In between times, Norwich were stretched to stay on terms in a lively contest and eventually fell behind to Ishmael Miller after the break. But substitute Wes Hoolahan slipped home from close range within five minutes of leaving the bench to round off a fine move triggered by Nathan Redmond. The Johnson no-goal was a big talking point. He knocked the ball in almost on the line after Cameron Jerome had headed goalwards from Redmond's fine run and cross. There was no flag from assistant referee Lisa Radhid but Miller was prompted to consult her amid strong Huddersfield protests. The upshot was a booking for Johnson whose team mate Jerome was later lucky to escape at least a yellow for clattering over Tommy Smith. James Vaughan, albeit a handful, failed with at least two chances to punish Norwich for whom keeper John Ruddy also denied Jacob Butterfield. Wesley Hoolahan (left) fires home the first equaliser just minutes after coming on as a substitute . But Miller struck with a smart turn on the edge of the box to smash home with Ruddy caught out of position. Jake Charles, 19 year old grandson of the great John Charles, was on the bench for Huddersfield in his first call up to the senior squad. Chris Powell's team were fighting a rearguard action in the last 20 minutes as a more fluent Norwich found their rhythm. Bradley Johnson (centre right) has a goal disallowed in the first half after handballing it into the net . The quick and clever Redmond was a constant source of danger down the right, forcing Town to substitute left back Jake Carroll. Clearly manager Alex Neil was in no mood to settle for a point as Norwich looked to climb from fifth place. Canaries appeals for a penalty were waved aside after Conor Coady was suspected of handling in the box. The Huddersfield players complain to the referee and Johnson was then booked for his handball .","highlights":"Jamar Loza equalised for Norwich after 96 minutes to save a point .\nFormer Canarie James Vaughan scored what he thought was the winner after 95 minutes and was then sent off for the home side .\nIshmael Miller gave the home side the lead before Wes Hoolahan scored .\nNorwich lost ground on the Championship top two after failing to win ."}
{"article":"(CNN)FIFA president Sepp Blatter has told Iran to end its \"intolerable\" ban on women attending football matches. Writing in the FIFA Weekly magazine published by world football's governing body, Blatter described the situation as one that \"cannot continue.\" Iran's ban was put in the spotlight at the Asian Cup in Australia earlier this year, when thousands of female Iranian fans watched their team without restriction. At the match against Iraq, activists unfurled a banner showing the face of Ghoncheh Ghavami, a British-Iranian woman jailed for trying to watch a volleyball match against Brazil in 2014, and called for the ban to end. The measure was imposed following the 1979 Islamic Revolution because the idea of mixed crowds was deemed un-Islamic. Iran is in the running to host the 2019 edition of the Asian tournament, for which the United Arab Emirates is also bidding. But the ban is widely expected to scupper its chances of securing the event. Blatter wrote: \"I raised the topic at my meeting with the President of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, and came away with the impression that this intolerable situation could change over the medium term. \"However, nothing has happened. A collective stadium ban still applies to women in Iran, despite the existence of a thriving women's football organization. \"This cannot continue. Hence my appeal to the Iranian authorities -- open the nation's football stadiums to women.\" During last year's football World Cup, CNN reported how fans in Iran gathered to watch games in venues that defied a ban on public screenings. At one coffee shop in the capital, Tehran, the tense game against Argentina -- a game Iran lost only to an injury-time Lionel Messi goal -- was watched by a large mixed crowd. \"100 percent it's better this way,\" said Negar Valayi. \"It doesn't happen often. It would be great if we have more of this.\" \"It's actually much better to watch it with a bunch of people around because it makes you feel more excited,\" said Roya Marzbahan. Hoardings advertising the World Cup throughout Tehran that summer had featured no pictures of women. And state TV broadcasts of matches employed a delay of several seconds in order for images of female fans deemed too racy to be censored. Blatter also hit out at football's continental confederations for failing to elect any women onto governing body's executive committee. The committee includes three women -- one of whom has voting rights and two of whom are co-opted -- but they are elected directly by the FIFA congress following a change to the statutes in 2011. \"This was hard work because the members of FIFA's executive committee are elected by the national associations... and there was never, never a proposal for a woman to be finally in FIFA,\" the 78-year-old said at an event in Switzerland. \"We had to take the decision, and I did it in 2011 at the end of the congress, [that] we must have at least one woman on the executive committee.\" He described football as a \"macho\" sport and warned: \"We should change in the future.\"","highlights":"FIFA president writes about issue in FIFA Weekly magazine .\nHe says he discussed it during talks with Iranian president .\nThousands of Iranian women watched games at Asian Cup in Australia .\nProtests held at tournament called for ban to be ended ."}
{"article":"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN)For Iowa's economy, corn is everything. So it's no surprise that the Republican governor and other powerful voices in state agribusiness are vocal backers of the Renewable Fuel Standard, a federal rule that requires gasoline to be comprised of up to 10% in renewable fuels. One of those is ethanol -- with corn often a key ingredient. \"Don't mess with the RFS,\" Gov. Terry Branstad said Saturday, offering a not so subtle warning as he kicked off a daylong agriculture summit that featured a string of likely Republican presidential candidates. The RFS is a major issue that White House hopefuls are forced to address whenever they visit the No. 1 corn-producing state that also goes first in the presidential nominating calendar. But it's a less popular policy for small government conservatives, who decry the mandate as federal overreach in the private sector. In his first 2016 visit to Iowa, Jeb Bush sought to delicately explain his desire to see the RFS disappear over time. \"The market's ultimately going to have to decide this,\" he told the audience at the event, which took place at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. Bush acknowledged that the mandate, which passed in 2007, has helped lower dependence on foreign oil and boost corn-heavy economies. \"But as we move forward over the long haul, there should be certainty for people to invest,\" he argued, saying ethanol will no longer need help from the government. \"So at some point we'll see a reduction of the RFS need, because ethanol will be such a valuable part of the energy feedstock for our country.\" He declined, however, to suggest when exactly that may happen. In his remarks, Bush also defended his position in favor of legal status for undocumented immigrants after they meet a wide set of requirements. And while attending a fundraiser Friday night in Des Moines, he stood by his support for Common Core, the controversial testing standards that have become a point of contention for conservatives. Election 2016: Jeb Bush makes his first Iowa foray . Bush's frank statements on the RFS and his defense of some of his most controversial views indicated that the former Florida governor plans on sticking with his positions as he gets ready to hit the campaign trail, no matter how unpopular they may be to certain audiences. Still, he was not totally immune to at least some pandering. Bush told the crowd that he'll be cooking some \"Iowa beef\" Sunday when he's back home with his family in Florida, adding that he'll probably make some \"really good guacamole,\" too. Talking about campaigning for his father's presidential campaigns in Iowa, Bush said he went to at least 50 counties. \"I remember eating really well -- eating really, really well.\" With a John Deere tractor towering near the stage, each candidate sat on stage for a 20-minute Q&A with Bruce Rastetter, an agribusiness entrepreneur and major Republican donor in Iowa. The audience of close to 1,200 was comprised largely of farmers and other leaders in the agriculture industry. While Bush took a mild approach to the RFS, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas flat out opposed it, saying Washington shouldn't be \"picking winners and losers.\" \"I have every bit of faith that businesses can continue to compete and continue to do well without having to go on bended knee asking for subsidies, asking for special favors,\" he said. \"I think that's how we got in this problem to begin win.\" Ethanol proponents argue that because oil companies own gas stations, consumers are unable to access ethanol and therefore it needs the government's support to break through oil's stronghold of the market. Cruz acknowledged that his view wouldn't be well-received, but tried to argue that it proved his authenticity. \"Look, I recognize that this is a gathering of a lot of folks who the answer you'd like me to give is, 'I'm for the RFS, darn it.' That'd be the easy thing to do. But I'll tell ya, people are pretty fed up, I think, with politicians that run around and tell one group one thing, tell another group another thing.\" Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry took a similar stance and defended his decision to request a waiver that would exempt Texas from the federal mandate. If individual states want to require that ethanol be used in gasoline, that's fine, he said, but not the federal government. \"I philosophically don't agree that Washington, D.C. needs to be making these decision that affect ... our agriculture industry,\" Perry said. Other contenders offered entirely opposite positions. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, for example, said he \"absolutely\" supports the RFS. \"That's what the law requires. So let's make sure we comply with the law. That should be the minimum,\" he said, drawing applause from the crowd. Rick Santorum, who won the Iowa caucuses in 2012, ticked off what he called a \"laundry list\" of benefits, including more energy independence and more jobs for farmers. \"It is very important for rural Americans,\" said the former senator from Pennsylvania. For his part, Mike Huckabee argued that the ethanol mandate was a matter of national security. \"America needs to do three things to be free: feed itself, fuel itself, fight for itself,\" the former Arkansas governor said, adding that relying on foreign governments for energy leads to a weakened United States. Huckabee, who won the Iowa caucuses in 2008, hit back at criticism that politicians like him simply support the RFS for political reasons. \"The decisions are made not just frankly for what's best for Iowa -- that's not the rationale. You can't make a decision and say, 'It's good for Iowa. Gee, they're the caucus state, we better suck up to them.' We better make decisions that are good for every consumer,\" he said. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who's had a strong showing in polls since he visited the state in January, made clear that while he's generally a free market guy, he believes ethanol is being blocked from consumers and needs government assistance. \"Right now, we don't have a free and open marketplace, and so that's why I'm willing to take that position,\" he said. But, similar to Bush, Walker said that he expects ethanol can one day compete openly and \"you no longer need in the industry to have these subsidies.\" The audience at Saturday's event was largely subdued, given the tone and dialogue of the summit was more substance, less red meat. Those who supported the RFS, however, received a strong response from the crowd. As for those who opposed it, Bill Couser, who co-chairs a campaign called America's Renewable Future which pushes the ethanol mandate, said he's not ready to write anyone off quite yet. But those candidates can expect to hear a lot more from him in the coming months. \"Maybe I didn't like a few of their answers, but it's going to give me some time to go help them understand the issues,\" he said.","highlights":"Iowa politicians, residents very protective of corn's role in their economy .\nGOP presidential hopefuls take up hot topic of ethanol, used in motor vehicles ."}

{"article":"The Football Association will wait on referee Mike Dean's report before deciding whether to take action against Steve Bruce or Gus Poyet for their touchline spat on Tuesday night. Dean's report is due in to the FA on Wednesday, meaning if action is taken against the Hull and Sunderland managers it will be announced on Thursday at the earliest. Sunderland boss Poyet has refused to apologise for the behaviour which saw him sent off during the 1-1 draw at the KC Stadium. Hull boss Steve Bruce (left) and Sunderland's Gus Poyet (right) will find out if they will be charged this week . Bruce is held back by the assistant referee during his clash with Poyet on the touchline . Things turned sour when Bruce and Poyet began a slanging match and had to be pulled apart . Poyet was dismissed for kicking over a cooler box before clashing on the touchline with Bruce. The rival bosses were only kept apart by the assistant referee and both could face further sanction should the FA investigate the clash which was sparked when Poyet sarcastically applauded in Bruce\u2019s face. But the Uruguayan blamed Dean for his reaction after he booked Jack Rodwell for diving. Poyet said: \u2018Kicking a bottle of water is nothing serious. \u2018I was not happy with Paul McShane (Hull defender) dancing like he was in the theatre, or like he\u2019d been shot, and won a free-kick before that. \u2018Jack then dived and got a free-kick against him, I just want fairness. \u2018I have no regrets whatsoever. I now have to convince the officials not to put buckets of drinks around me.\u2019 Jack Rodwell appeals for a foul but is booked for diving, a decision that led to Poyet's reaction . The two managers are restrained by match officials who try desperately to keep them away from each other . As the pair locked horns Bruce makes sure he gets his point across by bellowing in Poyet's direction . Poyet's side were lucky to escape with a point and will be fined \u00a325,000 by the FA after six of their players were booked, including Lee Cattermole who picked up a two-game ban following his 10th yellow of the season. Bruce, meanwhile, did not reveal what Poyet had said to provoke his furious reaction. But he admitted it had been unsavoury. \u2018I think it\u2019s right that I keep what he said to myself,\u2019 he said. \u2018But it wasn\u2019t very pleasant. It wasn\u2019t \u201chave a nice evening, Steve\u201d. \u2018But I don\u2019t know why I reacted like that. We all do stupid things but it was handbags. \u2018I thank the assistant referee for stepping in. I\u2019ll have to buy him a beer. \u2018I just think Gus had seen it differently about Rodwell diving. But the referee got it right. \u2018All I said to his assistant was that Rodwell had dived. \u2018These things happen in the heat of the moment. Grown men acting like a couple of children. They happen in big games. Let\u2019s forget about it and go and have a glass of wine.\u2019 Poyet was sent to the stands for his antics and could face further punishment after the game .

The escalation in fighting in recent weeks, particularly near Donetsk airport and in the Debaltseve area, resulted in hundreds of deaths, both civilian and military, according to a new report. The report paints a picture of \"merciless devastation of civilian lives and infrastructure,\" said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein. He called for all sides to adhere to the Minsk agreement, which calls for a ceasefire in many of the conflict's hotspots. The fighting has inflicted extreme humanitarian hardship on civilians. \"Many have been trapped in conflict zones, forced to shelter in basements, with hardly any drinking water, food, heating, electricity or basic medical supplies,\" Zeid said in a statement. The notion that civilians remained in the conflict zone of their own will is \"misguided,\" he said. \"Many people stay because they fear for their lives if they try to move. Many others stay to protect children, other family members, or their property. And some are forced to stay against their will, or are simply physically unable to leave,\" Zeid said. A series of terror attacks in Mariupol, as well as in Kharkiv and Odesa, which are outside of the conflict zone, have set a bad precedent, he said. \"Should this trend continue, this would represent a new and very deadly chapter in this conflict, expanding the areas where the rule of law and the protection of human rights are effectively absent,\" Zeid said. The UN arrived at the new estimated death toll of over 6,000 by tallying 5,809 documented deaths and assessing that many more must have been killed in recent fighting in other areas, particularly Donetsk airport and around Debaltseve.","highlights":"Fighting in recent weeks at Donetsk airport and in Debaltseve has killed hundreds, UN says .\nCivilians who haven't left often don't for fear of being killed, if they try to move ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Pablo Picasso once asked: \"Are we to paint what's on the face, what's inside the face or what's behind it?\" Jessica Todd Harper's photo book \"The Home Stage\" does all three simultaneously. \"The Home Stage\" contains intimate, psychological portraits that Harper has created of herself, her family and friends, and their children. The book weaves in some photos of other people's families as well, and includes writing by Alain De Botton and Alison Nordstrom. Using her camera like a paintbrush to stroke the canvas that is her environment, Harper explores the experiences of parenting and childhood. As a mother to twin sons and a daughter, her photos contain a wide range of raw emotion, ranging from comfort and conflict to sleepiness and satisfaction. Harper's first photo book, \"Interior Exposure,\" focused on the early years of her marriage and adult family life. She says her latest book is like a natural segue, as \"The Home Stage\" includes many photos of children. The title -- \"The Home Stage\" -- has more than one particular meaning or reference. \"One is to convey that stage in life when you're anchored to the home with young children,\" Harper said. \"It also references how the home is the first stage in which children learn how to live in every situation. In my particular pictures, many of them have a stage-like quality. There's reference to tableau vivant of the past, these constructed images.\" Harper's mother was a big fan of the arts, and she would take young Harper and her sister to local art museums where they would copy paintings by hand, progressing from crayons to charcoal and, eventually, to pastels. \"I wanted to be just like Mary Cassatt and John Singer Sargent; those were the artists that I would copy a lot as a child,\" she said. \"I think those images got very much stuck into my deep psyche.\" She emphasizes that her photos are not the everyday snapshots that many parents post on Facebook -- the photos of children at various stages in their lives, attending birthday parties or riding tricycles. The book's pictures \"aren't documents,\" Harper said. \"They're making everyday moments have an eternal quality. It reminds us of our more general purpose in life, the meaning in everyday small things.\" The combination of Harper's color palette and the use of natural light fills every inch of her photos with rich detail. Many of Harper's photos contain several generations of her family, highlighting connections between the present, past and future. While the people Harper photographs are predominantly those most familiar with her, she makes an effort to not allow her camera to completely consume the lives of her subjects. \"I try to do a very good job of not being overbearing. ... I bring out the camera only when I have a very specific idea in mind. My children know that I'm an artist, I'm a photographer. They know that, but I don't think that they see that even in the top 10 of the ways that they relate to me, it's not as subjects,\" she said. \"I want to keep it that way because otherwise they become so self-conscious and they start doing things which are not natural or genuine.\" Each photo draws the curtain to reveal Harper's home stage -- Harper lying in bed with her son Marshall, her husband playing in the backyard with their children, her daughter sitting in a high chair. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Regardless of the subject matter of the photos, Harper says there is one thing that ties all of them together: light. Throughout \"The Home Stage,\" Harper also manages to effectively create a balance between carefully planned compositions and naturally occurring moments. While Harper recognizes that raising young children can be intense and tiresome, she emphasizes it is vital to take the initiative to create memories -- not simply wait to capture certain moments. This is evident with the self-portrait she made holding her son Nicholas, stopping her family in the midst of their dinner preparations. \"At the time, I felt like so many parents. I felt tired and distracted and busy trying to get things done. I felt a little bit of guilt about making this picture,\" Harper said. \"And yet I knew somewhere in the back of my head that there was an imperative that I must take moments. ... You're just so busy that if you don't purposefully force it, then it wouldn't happen.\" In one photo, viewers are witnesses to an intimate familial relationship as they simply see a mother as she lays her hand gently on her son's back. \"It's a universal mother-and-child gesture,\" Harper said. \"It doesn't even matter particularly who that individual mother or that individual child is because of the way they're framed and photographed. You can't see their faces. It's just the way that her hand is resting on his back. It's ownership and protection and love.\" Jessica Todd Harper is an American photographer based in Philadelphia. Her book \"The Home Stage\" is available on Amazon, and the photos are on display at The Print Center in Philadelphia until March 28.","highlights":"In her photo book \"The Home Stage,\" Jessica Todd Harper explores parenting and childhood .\nShe combines naturally occurring moments with carefully planned compositions ."}

The media reflect society. Evening news bulletins are full of speakers and commentators making grammatical errors and even mispronouncing words. How could Dante's land become \"ignorant\" and will the government's plans to institute yet another education reform succeed in turning some donkeys -- if not into nerds -- at least into smart pupils? The decline in language skills is a trend affecting most of the Western world, but the fact that this is happening in Italy, home to some of the world's oldest universities, is quite alarming. The Romans built an empire united by the Latin language, but Italians seem to have lost such heritage. Italians were once \"literate\" -- as in \"Latin-speakers and Latin-writers\" -- grammar-savvy, poetry lovers, rhetoric freaks and great philosophers. Now they've forgotten what a conjunctive verb is, mistake adjectives for nouns and write Machiavelli with a double \"c.\" Oh -- and they don't know how to break words into syllables. True, one could say Italian is a tough language, one of the most complex in the world. But that's not a good excuse. The Italian people's declining knowledge of their language is turning into a national emergency. It's not just lazy students who are responsible. The percentage of lawyers who every year flunk the written examination to become a judge is scary. When I attended university, the most dreaded exam of all was the essay on Italian literature and history. Few of my buddies passed it at the first go, others had to take it thrice and many just gave up. So how did we fall so low? Fine, ICT, smartphones and SMS are partly to blame. Abbreviations, misspellings and the introduction of many English words into Italian have impoverished language skills. Yet on its own that explanation is too reductive. The loss of Latin teaching in schools is at the root of the problem. Learning Latin assists in learning Italian and other languages as well as opening the mind to all fields of knowledge. It's been no secret across generations of scholars that being familiar with the complexity of Latin phrase structure and idioms is positive for students. Up until 1970, Latin was taught in primary and middle schools: kids learned to translate works by Virgil without using a dictionary and to recite chunks of the \"Divine Comedy\" and poems by Carducci, Leopardi and Manzoni. But today the teaching of Latin is restricted to specific humanist and scientific high schools -- called gymnasiums or lyceums -- and at university level depending upon the faculty. The crisis has dealt a further blow to the love of classics. Enrollment at classical lyceums, where also ancient Greek is also taught, is low: Only 31,860 out of a total 530,911 high school students have enrolled this academic year. Desperate attempts by modern writers to revive classical culture by translating Boccaccio's \"Decameron\" and Machiavelli's \"The Prince\" into modern Italian haven't produced great results. So far just one academy in Rome -- Vivarium Novum -- has succeeded in bringing the \"dead language\" back from the grave. Pupils here exclusively speak in Latin and are kicked-out if they get caught saying a few words in Italian. But the academy is an isolated case, looked upon as a bit \"out of this world.\" Families think learning Latin and Greek is pointless because it won't help their kids find a job, which is wrong. The trouble is that students have already lost their memory. Not in the literal sense, but symbolically. The \"ars mnemonica\" -- the art of exercising one's memory, that boring yet useful technique which implies rote learning of phrases, lyrics, novels and even entire epics -- belongs to the past. If you don't sharpen mental skills, how can there be good writing? The truth is that Italian education is badly in need of a restyle. A series of education reforms in the past few years has lowered the quality of teaching by reducing public resources and the hours of Latin and Italian language learning, which teaching unions say has had a negative impact on pupils' text comprehension skills. Latin teaching should be given more space but in a new way: Not through useless translations (what do kids care about Seneca's \"Treaty on Birds?\") but through open debates and analyses on ancient texts that are still worthwhile studying today. And teachers should also get a makeover. Their mindset is old. If there are \"bad\" students it's because there are also \"bad\" teachers. Pupils want to read more than just one contemporary novel per month. They want teachers who are passionate about their jobs rather than lazily coasting towards retirement. Language teaching depends on its appeal. It must be sexy. And right now it's not.","highlights":"Italy, birthplace of the Latin and Italian, is becoming illiterate, writes Silvia Marchetti .\nMarchetti says Italians' declining knowledge of their mother tongue is becoming an emergency .\nThe approach to teaching Latin in Italian schools needs a makeover, she says ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Nine foreign workers are believed to be in the hands of ISIS-affiliated militants after an attack on a Libyan oil field, according to officials. Libya's internationally recognized government has blamed \"ISIS militias\" for the attack Friday in which the Al-Ghani oil field was set on fire. The kidnapped foreigners were working for VAOS, an Austrian-owned oil services company whose headquarters are in Tripoli, the Libyan capital. They include four Filipinos, an Austrian, a Czech and a Ghanaian, according to the Philippine foreign ministry. The Bangladeshi government said one of its citizens was also taken hostage. The nationality of the ninth worker was unclear. The abductions come amid Libya's deteriorating security situation in which Islamic militias, some of them pledging allegiance to the extremist group ISIS, have thrived. Egypt carried out airstrikes against ISIS militants in Libya last month after the killings of Egyptian Christians who had been kidnapped while working in a Libyan city. The Philippine foreign ministry said Monday that its Tripoli embassy had \"stepped up coordination\" with the Austrian company and Libyan authorities \"to locate the abducted Filipinos and ensure their safe and immediate release.\" Martin Weiss, a spokesman for the Austrian foreign ministry tweeted Monday that \"credible sources\" had confirmed that the Austrian citizen and other international workers were in the hands of ISIS \"terrorists.\" The attack on Al-Ghani is the latest in a recent spate of violence by militants targeting oil fields in Libya. The Libyan National Oil Corporation said over the weekend that it had warned VAOS more than two weeks ago to leave the area because of security concerns. VAOS wasn't immediately available for comment Tuesday. The Philippine foreign ministry said 52 other Filipinos are employed by VAOS but were relocated out of Al-Ghani \"much earlier\" and are now in Tripoli. Three other Filipinos have been missing in Libya since they were seized at the Mabruk oil field in February, the foreign ministry said. \"These cases underscore the escalating threat to the safety and security of Filipino oil workers in Libyan oil fields which have been targeted by armed groups in recent weeks,\" said foreign ministry spokesman Charles Jose. He said Philippine authorities were unsure at this point whether the kidnappers were ISIS members. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Marilia Brocchetto, and journalists Ayman Kekly and Arlene Samson-Espiritu, contributed to this report.","highlights":"The abducted workers were seized in an attack on an oil field last week .\nThey are from the Philippines, Bangladesh, Austria, the Czech Republic and Ghana .\nMilitants have carried out a series of attacks on oil fields in recent weeks ."}

Another unconvincing display was brought prematurely to an end moments after Di Maria flopped a hopeless right-wing cross into a visitors' box bereft of team-mates. But it could have been a different story if Di Maria - hauled off at half-time in Saturday's 2-0 win over Sunderland - had made his mark inside the opening minute. Angel di Maria trudges off the field after another disappointing performance for Manchester United .

Di Maria was marshalled out of the game by Newcastle midfielder Ryan Taylor (left) The Argentinian was sent clean through after a mistake by home defender Mehdi Abeid - but he inexplicably hesitated with the goal at his mercy and the chance was lost. It was destined to be Di Maria's best chance of making an impression. He was afforded plenty of space on the right flank but worked in fits and starts and was well marshalled by home pair Ryan Taylor and Sammy Ameobi. When he was too easily robbed in his own half one minute before the interval it sparked a charge upfield from Moussa Sissoko which ended in a clear-cut chance for Emmanuel Riviere in the visitors' box. The Argentina international is ushered back to the dug out after being substituted on 59minutes . Louis van Gaal hauled Di Maria off early for a second consecutive Premier League game . Di Maria did offer the occasional hint of quality in the second period, not least in the 54th minute when he provided the cross from which Marouane Fellaini then Ashley Young brought fine saves out of Tim Krul. But all too often the fickers were extinguished by those lackadaisical losses of possession of inexplicable passes into empty space. And shortly after one wasted opportunity too many, Di Maria was substituted again with the home fans' chants of 'what a waste of money' ringing in his ears.

{"article":"(CNN)Iraqi forces battling to wrest Tikrit from ISIS are now in control of the city, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said Tuesday on Iraqiya TV. Al-Abadi, who is also the top military commander, said on state television that the city was liberated. While al-Abadi has declared victory in the battle, pockets of fighting continues. Iraqi forces and Shiite militias are taking part in clearing operations. Iraqi forces reached the center of Tikrit and hoisted the nation's flag on top of the Governorate Building, al-Abadi said. Fighting continued on the outskirts of the city, he added. Tikrit had been under ISIS control since June. The push into Tikrit comes days after a series of U.S.-led airstrikes targeted ISIS targets around the city. The airstrikes made it possible for the Iraqi forces to move through the city. Troops reported finding dozens of roadside bombs and booby-trapped buildings as they combed the city. At a Cabinet meeting before he declared Tikrit liberated, al-Abadi was already calling the operation a success. \"The success of the Tikrit experiment will be repeated in other areas because of the results it has achieved on the battlefield, on a humanitarian level, protecting civilians as much as possible, in addition to the low casualties amongst our security forces,\" he said. Iraqi forces have tried multiple times to win back Tikrit since ISIS conquered the city as part of its campaign to amass an expansive Islamic caliphate but failed until now. This operation, however, was the biggest by the Iraqi military so far. \"We managed to take (ISIS) by surprise,\" the Prime Minister said. \"And our air force ... in addition to coalition air force, helping Iraqi forces, managed to deal severe blows to ISIS and the enemies of Iraq. And our ground forces with the blood of Iraqis, Iraqis alone with their own blood,  were able to liberate this land.\" The latest push began after al-Abadi ordered Iraqi forces on March 1 to retake Tikrit and Salahuddin province. Militants have been under pressure ever since in the battleground city, which is the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and is located about 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of Baghdad. The Iraqi forces were aided by a coalition made up of mostly Shiite militiamen and volunteers. The militia members, estimated to number around 20,000, are backed by Iran. The offensive marked the first very overt participation of Iranian advisers on the front lines. The victory in Tikrit sets the stage for Iraqi forces to take back an even bigger prize: Mosul. Mosul is Iraq's second-biggest city and the site of one of its military's biggest embarrassments, when Iraqi troops dropped their weapons and ran rather than defend their posts last June. A U.S. official said in February that up to 25,000 Iraqi troops plan to return to Mosul in April or May and, ideally, win it back. This comment came days after al-Abadi told the BBC that while there's still work to do, he felt confident Iraqis could recapture the key northern city. CNN's Arwa Damon, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Jason Hanna and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","highlights":"ISIS still has some fighters in Tikrit; joint forces are in clearing operations .\nPrime Minister says that Tikrit is back under government control .\nGovernment has its eyes on a bigger prize with the city of Mosul ."}

{"article":"Manchester City defender Martin Demichelis has signed a one-year contract extension. The Argentina international was approaching the end of his previous deal but has now committed until the end of the 2015-16 season. Demichelis, 34, has become an important member of City's defensive unit after an initially shaky start following his move to the Etihad Stadium in September 2013. Martin Demichelis (left) has signed a new one-year deal with Manchester City . 'I want to say that I am really proud and happy to have extended my contract for another year,' Demichelis told the club's official website. 'Manchester City is a club with a lot of ambition. We want to grow every year. 'When you get to hold a trophy, it's the best feeling for any player. 'I want to say that I will fight for this club and for my team-mates until the end of my contract. I will fight to try and win titles.' Demichelis worked with City manager Manuel Pellegrini at River Plate and Malaga and followed the Chilean to Manchester from the Spanish club via a brief, appearanceless, stint at Atletico Madrid. He also had a successful nine-year spell at Bayern Munich earlier in his career and was a member of the Argentina side that reached last year's World Cup final. His early appearances for City were not impressive but he improved considerably after the nadir of a red card in a Champions League loss to Barcelona in February last year. Demichelis overcame a shaky start to his City career to establish himself in the back four . He played a key role in the season run-in that culminated with title success and he has made 30 appearances this season. Demichelis says he is now settled in England and has not even ruled out looking to stay beyond his new deal. He said: 'We are happy here - my wife and son are happy here. We are trying to improve our English and I think that's a good thing for our future. 'At this stage I am enjoying playing week to week - you can never say what can happen in the future.' Demichelis follows Joe Hart, Vincent Kompany, David Silva, Sergio Aguero, Samir Nasri and Aleksandar Kolarov in committing to the club over the last year. Discussions with another player out of contract at the end of the season, James Milner, remain ongoing. The England international has been linked with a move abroad in recent days but Pellegrini has often said they are hopeful new terms can be agreed.","highlights":"Martin Demichelis has signed a deal until the end of the 2015\/16 season .\nThe Manchester City defender had a shaky start to his Etihad career .\nBut he has established himself as a key member of the squad .\nDemichelis wants to continue to fight for titles while he is at the club ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Vigilante motorists in New Zealand have taken to snatching the car keys of foreign drivers amid rising concern over dangerous driving by tourists. New Zealand media have reported five cases this year of locals forcibly taking the keys of foreign motorists after witnessing driving that concerned them. All the incidents -- which have been condemned by authorities -- took place in the South Island, which draws tourists from around the world for its rugged scenery, including lakes and mountains featured in director Peter Jackson's \"Lord of the Rings\" films. The incidents occurred amid heightened public concern over tourist driving standards, with eight people killed in crashes involving foreign drivers in the space of a fortnight last month. Among the dead were a family of four from Hong Kong who were killed when their car crossed the center line and collided with a logging truck. The key snatchings have even prompted Prime Minister John Key to weigh in on the issue, advising that \"people taking the law into their own hands is not sensible.\" New Zealand Police Assistant Commissioner of Road Policing Dave Cliff said the confiscations existed in a legal gray area, as there was no explicit statute dealing with the issue. Although there might be exceptional circumstances where taking someone's keys could be legally justified, such as preventing drunken driving, he said, \"in the vast majority of cases, it won't be.\" \"That extends to physically assaulting or abusing someone in response to their driving, which is simply not acceptable, and anyone found doing so should expect to face the consequences,\" he said. Diesel mechanic Robert Penman of Dunedin made headlines last month after he took the keys of a Chinese couple who had stopped their car on a narrow single-lane road to take pictures, causing a backlog of vehicles behind them. \"I was coming into town with my wife and son and came around the corner, and there was a car stopped in the middle of the road,\" he told CNN affiliate TVNZ. He called police and took their keys as \"a safety thing, you know, timeframe for police to get there,\" he said. The New Zealand Transport Agency later revealed that Penman was driving on an expired license himself. Penman told local media it was not the first time he had taken a tourist's car keys. Only 6% of crashes in New Zealand involve foreign drivers, according to the latest figures provided by the Ministry of Transport. But in some remote regions of the South Island particularly popular with tourists for their scenery -- such as the Mackenzie, Southland, Queenstown-Lakes and Kaikoura districts -- foreign drivers are involved in about a quarter of all crashes. In Westland District, on the South Island's rugged West Coast, foreign drivers are involved in 37% of road crashes resulting in death or injury. Tony Kokshoorn, mayor of the neighboring Grey District, said tourist driving behavior was a major problem in the region and attributed the issue to tourists from countries that drive on the right. New Zealanders drive on the left. \"There's a huge number of tourists coming through to these destinations because of the scenery, but the scenery is a problem,\" he said. \"There's so many beautiful sights to see that they're not concentrating on their driving. Once they lose their concentration, they tend to fall into old habits and drive on the right. Even for 20 seconds, it can cause damage.\" A Ministry of Transport spokesperson said that while this was a factor, figures showed that Australian and British drivers were involved in the most crashes overall, \"so unfamiliarity with which side of the road to drive on is not the only factor.\" Kokshoorn said that he had seen three cases of tourists driving on the wrong side of the road recently but that the vigilante approach -- which had seen a visitor to his town punched in the face as he was stripped of his keys last month -- was \"disgraceful.\" He said the best approach was better education on local driving conditions for foreign drivers, particularly at the rental companies where they picked up their vehicles. Anyone with a foreign drivers license or permit is able to drive in New Zealand for up to a year. Associate Transport Minister Craig Foss said the government recognized that \"many people are concerned with poor driving behavior on challenging roads in and around popular tourist destinations\" and had established a project in response. The measures include improvements to roading, such as \"keep left\" signage and no-passing markings on the extensive stretches of single-lane highway, and educational resources targeted at visiting drivers, including many targeting the growing Chinese market. Kokshoorn said it was important to \"strike the right balance\" in getting the message to foreign drivers to take care on the unfamiliar roads. \"We value tourism and the dollars it brings to New Zealand, especially to our region here. We don't want to put tourists off, but we want them to be safe in our country,\" he said. \"You cross that center line, and anything's possible.\" CNN's David Molko contributed to this report.","highlights":"Five tourists have had their car keys snatched by vigilantes this year .\nThe confiscations have taken place amid rising concern over tourist driving behavior .\nIn popular Westland, 37% of serious crashes have involved foreign drivers ."}
{"article":"(CNN)For decades, no one has been able to convict millionaire Robert Durst. Not after his wife's disappearance. Not after his friend's suspicious death. Not even after he admitted he killed and dismembered his neighbor. But it may be Durst who does himself in with 11 words he muttered in a restroom: . \"What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.\" Those comments were picked up on a microphone he was wearing for the HBO documentary series about him called \"The Jinx.\" Apparently, the real estate heir didn't turn his microphone off when he went to the bathroom. Durst now sits in a New Orleans jail after his arrest Saturday in connection with the 2000 death of his longtime friend Susan Berman in Los Angeles. On Monday, California prosecutors said Durst was \"lying in wait\" when he shot and killed Berman because she \"was a witness to a crime.\" She had been shot in the head shortly before investigators were supposed to come ask her about the disappearance of Durst's first wife in 1982. Durst will be transferred to Los Angeles to face a first-degree murder charge. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. When he goes to trial, could those 11 words be admitted in court? Here, several legal experts weigh in: . Yes: . His lawyer could argue that he absolutely did. \"Here's what his attorneys are going to say: They are going to say that he had an expectation of privacy,\" HLN legal analyst Joey Jackson said. \"And as a result of that, putting this in context, he excused himself and went into a private bathroom.\" No: . That argument might not fly, CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. \"That whole theory of the Constitution is that you have an expectation of privacy under certain circumstances when you're dealing with the police. But here, he's dealing with filmmakers.\" Furthermore, Toobin said, Durst had a microphone on. \"You can't have an expectation of privacy when you're wearing a microphone. Yeah, he maybe forgot, but that's not good enough.\" Yes: . The defense very well could, said Jackson, the HLN analyst. \"The attorneys are going to further argue that there was governmental action in as much as HBO was working very closely with the authorities. And they're going to say, isn't it coincidental how his arrest comes on the heels of the final episode of this HBO documentary?\" No: . CNN legal analyst Paul Callan doesn't think that defense will work. \"In criminal law, the police can't wire somebody up. They have to give you Miranda warnings if they're going to take a statement from you,\" he said. \"However, if a civilian is tape-recording you, as was the case here with HBO, that's admissible in court if it's relevant to the crime committed.\" Yes: . He could. Susan Criss was the judge during Durst's 2003 murder trial in which he admitted to shooting an elderly neighbor and then dismembering him. She remembers how prosecutors didn't use many of his admissions. \"In our trial, he had been recorded on the phone talking to his wife and friends, making a lot of admissions, and the state never used that,\" she said. \"But he was aware that he had been recorded saying things that could implicate him in the murder that we were trying.\" No: . Probably not. Section 1220 of the California Penal Code says \"evidence of a statement is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule when offered against the declarant in an action to which he is a party in either his individual or representative capacity.\" In this case, Durst is the declarant who spoke those words, and if they're used against him, they could be fair game. Yes: . It's a card the defense could certainly play. \"It will be up to (defense attorney) Dick DeGuerin to talk about, and I think he's going to have a field day with the idea that it wasn't an answer in response to a question, (so) that's meaningless,\" CNN legal analyst Mark Geragos said. Already, one of Durst's attorneys has said not to read too much into his client's offhand remarks. \"Your honesty would lead you to say you've said things under your breath before that you probably didn't mean,\" attorney Chip Lewis told Fox News' \"Justice With Judge Jeanine.\" \"We want to contest the basis for his arrest, because I think it's not based on facts, it's based on ratings,\" DeGuerin told reporters Tuesday in New Orleans. \"So we will continue to fight for Bob. We want to get to California as quickly as we can so we can get into a court of law and try this case where it needs to be tried.\" No: . The prosecution could argue Durst knew what was going on. \"Earlier in those interviews, in a previous interview for that very program, there was a break where he was caught practicing his testimony. And so he realized ... he had a mic on,\" said Criss, the judge from Durst's earlier trial. \"This is a third time he's made that mistake. That's amazing.\" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","highlights":"Real estate heir Robert Durst has been investigated in two deaths and a disappearance .\nA microphone catches Durst saying he \"killed them all\"\nLegal experts debate whether that audio can be used against him in court ."}

The semiofficial Anadolu Agency quoted Energy Minister Taner Yildiz as saying the cause of the outage was unknown. Yildiz, speaking during a visit to Slovakia, said he could neither confirm nor deny that a cyberattack had triggered the blackout, the Anadolu Agency reported. Flightradar24, which maps real-time flight data on the Internet, tweeted that the outage was \"affecting flights,\" and said 11 of its 16 air traffic monitoring systems receivers -- as distinct from the country's air traffic control system -- were not working. The Turkish Electricity Transmission Co. blamed the outage on a problem with transmission lines, Anadolu Agency reported. The utility said an investigation was in progress, as were efforts to restore power, the news agency said. The outage began at 10:36 a.m. (3:36 a.m. ET). Nearly two hours later, according to Anadolu Agency, about 15% of the power had been restored to Istanbul and Ankara, including in some subway stations. Power also was beginning to flow again to a number of provinces that had been cut off, the agency reported. By midafternoon, Yildiz said, 90% of Istanbul's power had been restored. \"Crowded places such as metro stations have been given electricity, and we believe the rest of the country should be fully powered shortly,\" he said. CNN\"s Gul Tuysuz contributed to this report from Istanbul.","highlights":"Energy minister says 90% of Istanbul's power has been restored .\nTurkish Prime Minister: All possible causes of outage under investigation, including terrorism ."}
{"article":"Montabaur, Germany (CNN)Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz's voice isn't heard in a recording of the final moments of Germanwings Flight 9525. But investigators say he was the one at the controls inside the cockpit, deliberately locking out the plane's captain and setting the plane on a crash course for the French Alps. Andreas Lubitz had medical note for day of crash, hid illness, officials say . The only sound the recorder picked up from Lubitz as the Airbus A320 went down, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said, was the co-pilot's steady breathing. Authorities didn't mince words Thursday as they blamed Lubitz for the crash, but questions are still swirling over the 27-year-old's past. Officials say Lubitz passed a psychological test when he was hired, had no known ties to terrorism and showed no sign of medical distress during the flight. It seems, Robin said, that Lubitz \"wanted to destroy the aircraft.\" But why? Lufthansa CEO 'speechless' It's a question police were trying to answer as they searched Lubitz's apartment in Dusseldorf. Police spokesman Markus Niesczery said a team of five investigators went \"through the apartment looking for clues as to what the co-pilot's motivation might have been, if he did indeed bring the plane down.\" About 85 miles (136 km) away in the town of Montabaur, the house where Lubitz's parents live was shuttered and guarded by police. A group of men, perhaps investigators, were the only ones granted access. This town in western Germany is where Lubitz pursued his love of flying from a young age. At a club on the outskirts of Montabaur, pilots who knew Lubitz said they were shocked to hear what investigators said. They said the man they know never would have deliberately crashed a plane. Between the ages of 14 and 20, Lubitz was a regular fixture at the gliding club. \"(He was) a very normal young person, full of energy,\" Klaus Radke said. \"What can I say? He had a bright future. He made his hobby into his job. What more can you hope to achieve?\" The authorities' explanation doesn't ring true for Peter Ruecker, another pilot who knew him from the flight club. \"Knowing Andreas, this is just inconceivable for me,\" Ruecker told the Reuters news agency. \"He was a lot of fun, even though he was perhaps sometimes a bit quiet,\" Ruecker said. \"He was just another boy, like so many others here.\" A neighbor told Reuters that Lubitz \"was very interested in things which are going on around him.\" \"It's a very good family,\" the neighbor said. \"They have a good connection within the family and they are engaged in the community.\" An 8-minute descent to death . Lubitz had been with Germanwings, a budget airline owned by Lufthansa, since September 2013 and had completed 630 hours of flight time, the airline's media office said. Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr told reporters that Lubitz \"interrupted\" his training, which he began in 2008. That break lasted several months, he said, but added that such an interruption isn't uncommon. Spohr said he couldn't give any information about why the co-pilot had stopped and then restarted his training. If it was for medical reasons, he said, then that information would have been private before the crash, he said, but it will be part of information gathered during the investigation. Most of Lubitz's training took place at the Lufthansa flight training center in Bremen. He also trained in the United States, spending six months at facility in Arizona as part of a required program to get his license, a Lufthansa spokesperson said. Spohr said Lufthansa pilots get medical testing but do not undergo regular or routine psychological testing once they are flying. However, the airline does consider an applicant's psychological state, along with other factors, when hiring pilots, he said. Lubitz and the captain passed a psychological test when they were hired, he said. \"We don't only look at competence but we also give a lot of room to psychological capabilities,\" Spohr said. \"He was 100% set to fly without restrictions,\" he added. \"His flight performance was perfect. There was nothing to worry about.\" Students, singers among the victims . 5 cases of pilots intentionally crashing . Diana Magnay reported from Montabaur. Catherine E.

{"article":"A video purporting to show the executions of two alleged spies has been released by Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram. One of the men is made to make a full confession, explaining his 'crimes' to the camera, before they pair are beheaded and their bodies shown to the camera. The gruesome execution video echoes those posted by Islamic State and is the second released by Boko Haram. Scroll down for video . Brutal: A gruesome video allegedly showing the executions of two men accused of working as police spies has been released by Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram . The video, called 'Harvest of Spies', was posted Monday on Twitter by Boko Haram, the SITE intelligence group said today. It starts by showing a man kneeling in the foreground with a group of Boko Haram fighters approaching him holding a flag used by militant Islamist groups. In a theatrical display previously seen in the execution videos released by ISIS, the men line up behind the victim. The video then cuts to show two men, identified as Dawoud Muhammad and Muhammad Awlu, led by Boko Haram fighters before being made to kneel. One Boko Haram fighter, whose face has been blurred by the militant group, stands behind Dawoud Muhammad, holding a large knife. Spy: One of the victims is made to confess his 'crimes' to the camera before the two are beheaded . Horror: After one of the men has spoken of how they have spied on Boko Haram on behalf of the local police force, the pair are beheaded by militant fighters . Mr  Muhammad tells the camera that he  is a farmer from Baga, northern Nigeria, and is then made to answer a series of questions at knifepoint. Mr Muhammad reveals that hat he had been approached by a police officer who offered him money in exchange for infiltrating Boko Haram. 'We went to see a man from Mijka and a police officer that was with him. The officer gave me 5,000 Naira (\u00a316.20),' Mr Muhammad tells the camera. Mr Muhammad is made to confess that their mission has been to spy on the 'residents who live here' i.e. Boko Haram, and in exchange for spying, the police officers had promised him that he would 'become rich and will never go back to be a farmer again'. Promoting terror: The video emerged on a Boko Haram Twitter account on Monday . The camera pans from left to right in slow motion, showing Mr Muhammad and Mr Awlu on their knees as they are executed by Boko Haram fighters. The video fades before the actual beheadings take place, and then shows the two men's bodies with their heads placed upon their chests. The video does not reveal how the spies were caught by the militants and MailOnline has yet to confirm its authenticity. Boko Haram previously published only one beheading, of a Nigerian fighter pilot whose plane went missing in September. Mr Muhammad's home town of Baga, was the site of a series of mass killings carried out by Boko Haram in January this year which is believed to have resulted in 2,000 deaths and saw more than 14,000 people flee the city.","highlights":"Beheading video released by Nigerian terrorists Boko Haram .\nVideo allegedly shows execution of two men accused of spying .\nOne of the men confesses to spying on behalf of the Nigerian police ."}

Barca closed the gap at the top of the table to two points last weekend, and face Rayo Vallecano this weekend hoping that a Real slip-up could send them top. But while the pressure has been heaped on the European champions, Barcelona players Neymar, Adriano, Dani Alves and Douglas looked relaxed on Friday. Neymar posted this picture on Instagram of him and his team-mates at Barcelona's training ground . The Brazilian star scored on Wednesday in Barca's 3-1 win over Villarreal in the Copa del Rey . Neymar - suspended for Sunday's visit of Rayo - posted a picture of the quartet on Instagram after finishing off a training session at Barca's\u00a0Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper base. That came after Neymar was called up to Brazil's squad for their upcoming friendlies against France and Chile - with manager Dunga being questioned over whether his side was too reliant on their star man. 'Since he has been designated captain of the team, he has had an upgrade on his level of football,' Dunga said of Neymar. Neymar has been training with Barca ahead of facing Rayo Vallecano with the hope of closing a league gap . 'He likes challenges, the more responsibility he has, the more he will develop and get better. 'We are very happy to have him; he is doing fantastic things in Europe. 'Our priority is first to have a strong collective, and then as a second step, one outstanding player can naturally differentiate himself and help us to be better.' Neymar is not the pure focus of Brazil's national team squad, according to his manager Dunga .","highlights":"Neymar has been training ahead of Barcelona's game with Rayo Vallecano .\nThe Brazilian posted a selfie from Barca's training ground on Friday .\nBrazil manager Dunga has said his squad aren't entirely reliant on Neymar .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Barcelona news ."}
{"article":"(CNN)About 15 years ago, I was doing research on inheritance laws in Malawi and their impact on women. Part of my research methodology was to engage in focus group discussions with women in village settings. In order to do this in any village in Malawi, one has to seek permission from the village chief. And so I did. The chief told me to come back the next day so that he can have time to mobilize the women, as well as give them proper notice of the proposed discussion. When I came back the next day, the \"women\" had indeed gathered waiting for me. However I noticed that the \"women\" were not women, as such. They were... kids. Teenage girls. I said to the chief \"I was hoping to talk to women and not to kids or girls, as I don't think they would understand much about inheritance.\" His response was, \"but these are our women; look, they have babies with them and they are all married.\" I was shocked. Then it dawned on me, \"aah, girl-child marriages.\" After asking, I found the girls' ages ranged from 13 to 18, with two being 24. This then spurred me into action and it was the beginning of a decade-plus journey of understanding girl-child marriages in my country and fighting for the practice to end. What I found out was disheartening as the statistics came in. I was horrified to learn that Malawi has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world. It is ranked eighth of the 20 countries that are considered to have the highest rates of child marriage by the U.N. Population Fund. On average, one out of two girls in Malawi will be married by their 18th birthday, according to the United Nations. In 2010, half of the women (50%) aged 20--24 years were married or in a union before age 18 (compared to 6.4%of boys), while 12% of women married before they were 15 compared to only 1.2% of men. Child marriage is in both rural and urban areas. It is also higher than the regional average for sub-Saharan Africa (37%). 'Law, save the girls!' Being a lawyer, I looked to the law. \"My hero the law, save the girls,\" I thought! Yet, I soon found out that this was a complex story. The Constitution of Malawi, which is the supreme law of the land from whom all legal authority is derived, has provided for some measures of protection for all children. However the same Constitution defines children as those aged 16 and below. The United Nations defines children as those aged 18 and below and so to that extent the Constitution does not comply with international standards on definitions of childhood. The Constitution also allows marriages of persons aged 18 and below and it does not have a cut-off point where marriage is actually prohibited. This means for all intents and purposes, the Constitution of the Republic of Malawi allows child marriages. Alas the law had failed me! False hope? But there was hope in the air. In February, Malawi's parliament passed the Marriage, Divorce & Family Relations Bill of 2015 into law. This law was born amid the outcry against girl-child marriage, as the country had realized the dangers of girl-child marriage. Save for a few areas, it is a very progressive piece of legislation, particularly from a women's rights perspective. Among other things, the law prohibits marriage for anybody below the age of 18. So, does it mean that the Constitutional provisions fall away? The spanner in the works is that since the Constitution allows marriage below the age of 18, the new law to the extent that it prohibits child marriage is invalid. So whilst many have celebrated the new law, I haven't, as girls remain shackled by a Constitutional provision that basically allows child marriage. So until the Constitution changes and recognizes children as those aged 18 and above, and therefore puts marriage age at 18 giving many girls the opportunity to go to school and get educated, I will remain sad as I was 15 years ago. 'Guarantee for poverty' I will remain sad because I know the cost of child marriage. It deprives girls of education and undermines their self-confidence and self-identity. It also makes them prone to physical and emotional abuse by their so called husbands. Further to this, girl-child marriage inevitably means early parentage and higher risks of maternal mortality. As if this is not enough, studies have shown  that girl-child marriage is a risk factor in the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, as young wives do not have much bargaining power to negotiate safe sex with older men. Girl-child marriages need to be prohibited tough the Constitution because they are a violation of every conceivable human right including the right to life, health, education, human dignity and development. What I know for sure child marriage is a guarantee for poverty among girls in my country and I want it to end. No ifs or buts. More from African Voices . More from Opinions . The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Seodi White.","highlights":"50% of girls in Malawi will be married by the time they turn 18 .\nStudies show the practice increases the risks of childbirth for both mother and infant .\nNew laws preventing child marriage are still overruled by Malawi's Constitution ."}
{"article":"(CNN)A severe solar storm created a stunning display of light in the night sky over parts of the United States, Europe, Australia and New Zealand early Wednesday morning, spotted by those lucky enough to be awake in the wee hours. Called aurora borealis in the Northern Hemisphere and aurora australis in the Southern Hemisphere, the lights were the product of large geomagnetic blasts from the sun that arrived Tuesday about 10 a.m. ET (1 a.m. Wednesday in Sydney). Both the aurora borealis and the aurora australis were sparked by a particularly strong solar storm that sent charged particles toward the Earth, said CNN meteorologist Todd Borek. \"When these particles bombard the Earth's magnetic field in the upper atmosphere, the collision often creates brilliant colors,\" Borek said. \"Most of the time, auroras appear green -- when these particles collide with oxygen in the atmosphere -- but there were reports this past aurora australis also appeared to have a reddish tint, which suggested the collision with high-altitude oxygen was also seen on Earth.\" Share your photos of the aurora with iReport . The stronger the storm, the farther south it can be seen, said Borek. And this geomagnetic storm was rather powerful, reaching as a high as a G4 on a scale from 1 to 5 Tuesday night, according to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. The storm was expected to last 24 to 36 hours, and NOAA's latest reports say it's down to a G1. Though the storm could affect GPS technology and power grids, NOAA said Tuesday that it had no reports of disruptions. The most visible impact as been this stunning light display. If the auroras are seen again tonight, Borek said, they won't be as pronounced and most likely won't reach as far south as Tuesday night. People in northern Michigan, northern Minnesota and Maine may be able to spot them, although he warned that clouds from Minnesota to Montana may impede visibility Wednesday night.","highlights":"A particularly strong solar storm created a stunning light display .\nStronger storms can be seen farther south, CNN meteorologist says .\nSome in northern U.S. may see lights again tonight ."}
{"article":"(CNN)In tennis, a hitting partner is someone who often does more than just practice with a big star. They sometimes have to be psychologists, waiters, chauffeurs and even bodyguards. They may get to travel the world but the job isn't without its perils. Two years ago, for example, the father of Bernard Tomic, one of the most hyped players in the last decade, was found guilty of assaulting the player's former hitting partner, Thomas Drouet. Now, one of the longest lasting relationships -- and one of the highest profile -- has come to an end. Sascha Bajin, a constant in Serena Williams' life the past eight years, suggested on Twitter earlier this week that he was no longer working with the 19-time grand slam winner and has instead begun a partnership with Williams' friend and tennis rival, Victoria Azarenka. Williams wished him well. Their split was confirmed by Williams' agent, Jill Smoller, in an email to CNN.com, and Azarenka's coach, Wim Fissette, confirmed that Bajin is indeed the two-time grand slam champion's new hitting partner. They practiced together for the first time this week. \"I'm very excited about having Sascha in the team,\" Fissette told CNN.com in an email. \"Sascha is a great guy ... and has so much experience in working with Serena. \"I saw Sascha hit many times so I know he is just a very good tennis player. To give the player the best rhythm is extremely important. \"On the other hand I think it's very good there is someone else in the team with experience winning grand slams. That's always very important. Sascha knows what it is like to be in semifinals and finals in grand slams.\" No one has disclosed what led to the parting of ways but Bajin wasn't with Williams as she won the Australian Open in January. Bajin said he was injured, with Frenchman Jonathan Dasnieres de Veigy replacing him. Fissette, who was formerly alongside Kim Clijsters, Simona Halep and Sabine Lisicki when they either won or reached grand slam finals, said he was \"very surprised\" that Bajin became available. \"Sascha was working so many years with Serena and I felt they had an excellent relationship, more than just player and hitting partner,\" he said. \"I felt they were very good friends. \"But it's not my business to know what went wrong. Maybe they both needed a new challenge. I think everybody will remember the many years they worked together and the excellent results she had during that time.\" Williams, about to make her return to Indian Wells after a 14-year absence, once likened Bajin to a brother. \"Outside of my parents, I think he's probably the most important person on the team,\" Williams told USA Today in 2013. \"He's much more than a hitting partner. He's my older brother. He's family.\" Bajin's alliance with Azarenka serves as another change for the Belorussian. Azarenka split with coach Sam Sumyk -- who quickly moved on to Eugenie Bouchard -- and hired Fissette in his place in February. Azarenka is attempting to recapture top form after foot and knee injuries derailed her in 2014. \"From the first meeting, I felt a good connection (with Azarenka) and after the first two weeks I feel a very good connection,\" said Fissette. \"Vika is very motivated to get back to the top and wants to become a better player. That is what I feel on court and I believe it can be a great year for her. \"I believe it's also great for women's tennis that Vika is back. She is a great tennis player and an excellent entertainer.\"","highlights":"Serena Williams is no longer working with hitting partner Sascha Bajin .\nBajin, who worked with Williams for eight years, is now with Victoria Azarenka .\nBajin skipped this year's Australian Open as Williams won major No. 19 .\nAzarenka's coach, Wim Fissette, is thrilled to have Bajin in her team ."}
{"article":"(CNN)New Zealand are on course for a first ever World Cup title after a thrilling semifinal victory over South Africa, secured off the penultimate ball of the match. Chasing an adjusted target of 298 in just 43 overs after a rain interrupted the match at Eden Park, Grant Elliott hit a six right at the death to confirm victory and send the Auckland crowd into raptures. It is the first time New Zealand has ever reached a World Cup final, and it will play either Australia or India on Sunday. Te pair face each other in Sydney on Thursday. Not the first time in the sport, rain played a part. South Africa were motoring with the bat before a two-hour delay for poor weather. Though its total was escalated by the Duckworth\/Lewis method -- used to calculate a revised target in the event of a rain delay -- New Zealand held firm thanks to Elliott. His 84 not out underpinned its innings and it was fitting that he delivered the final blow, smashing Dale Steyn for six off the second last ball to spark jubilant scenes at Eden Park. \"I don't think this win is for myself or the team, but everyone here,\" Elliott said at the post-match presentation. \"The supporters have been amazing. \"I think we timed the pace of the innings to perfection. I wasn't as calm as I looked. When you have 45,000 fans screaming at you every ball... \"It has been an absolute pleasure playing in front of this crowd. We have had a good run. It is the first final we have been in as New Zealand. \"We are a very level team, we will approach it as any other game. Nothing going in my mind when I hit the six. I don't even know where the ball went.\" South Africa, who themselves have never reached the final, have been accused of choking in past installments of the one-day competition. But that indictment cannot be leveled at it after one of the most dramatic matches in World Cup history. It had recovered from 114-3 in the 27th over to 216-3 after 38 overs thanks to some fierce hitting from captain AB de Villiers and Faf du Plessis, before the rain came. With the game stopped for two hours, it finally reached 281 off its reduced 43 overs, du Plessis top scoring with 82. New Zealand's target was upgraded via Duckworth\/Lewis, a calculation that takes into account how many overs were left and how many wickets had been lost, to 298. Kiwi skipper Brendan McCullum got it off to a fast start with a 22-ball half-century but after he was dismissed it wobbled, and needed 139 from 22 overs. But Elliott was the steadying hand, judging his innings perfectly. And though he was dropped in the penultimate over, he struck the telling blow off Steyn to seal victory and inflict a fourth semifinal defeat on South Africa. \"It was a great advertisement for cricket,\" McCullum said at the post-match presentation. \"Everybody involved will remember this for the rest of their lives. \"What a great innings from Grant. He came out of wilderness not long ago. The greatest time of our lives. We have enjoyed the experience. \"I hope the crowds are all dreaming the way we are. Gee it would be nice to win it. We don't mind whom we face in the final. \"They are both quality sides, but we know if we play the way we want to we are a good chance.\" Should Australia beat India at the Sydney Cricket Ground, then the joint hosts of the World Cup will meet in the final in Melbourne. \"It was an amazing game of cricket,\" AB de Villiers said. \"Probably the most electric crowd I have ever heard in my life. I guess the best team has come out on top. We gave it our best. No regrets. \"We left it all out there. It is hurting. It is going to take a while to recover. The bigger picture is for the people back home. We play for them. I hope they can still be proud of us.\"","highlights":"New Zealand edge a thriller against South African to reach cricket World Cup final .\nGrant Elliott hits a six in the final over to seal Kiwi victory in front of Auckland crowd .\nSouth Africa had posted a total of 281 in a rain affected match .\nNew Zealand will face either Australia or India in the final on March 29 ."}
{"article":"(CNN)\"India's Daughter,\" the BBC Four documentary about the infamous 2012 gang rape in Delhi, premiered in the U.S. last week. If you haven't seen it, you have likely heard selections from the film's interview with Mukesh Singh, who is on death row for the crime. \"A decent girl won't roam around at nine o'clock at night. A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy,\" he says. \"When being raped, she shouldn't fight back. She should just be silent.\" Certain other men interviewed for the documentary say such things as, \"In our culture, there is no place for a woman\" and that if a daughter or sister \"engaged in pre-marital activities ... I would put petrol on her and set her alight.\" Note: Those men are not rapist-murderers. They are their lawyers. Many (I'd like to think most) of us cringed at these comments and their garishly clear misogyny. But these words were not just a window into one uniquely deranged soul. Let's be clear: Singh is just reading -- perhaps more loudly and cruelly than others, but still -- from a cultural script we all share. Yes, we all. Perhaps your first thought when you heard or read those words was, \"Violence against women is really bad...in India.\" And in many ways, of course, it is. Reports this weekend of a robbery at a Christian school in eastern India, in which, officials said, one of the assailants allegedly raped a 70-year-old nun, add to the narrative. But as unfathomable as this brutality is, we must resist the temptation to presume some sort of American violence-against-women exceptionalism, making others the bad guys while crowing about \"how far women have come\" in the United States. Or to say, \"Sure, we still have issues, but not like that.\" I know that temptation is there. Our global human rights organization, based in the U.S. and India, works to inspire individuals and institutions to drive the culture change needed to make violence against women unacceptable. When I describe our work -- including our campaigns and issues in both countries and beyond -- the questions people ask often reveal their at least initial assumption: that we here in the U.S. are working solely to stop violence against women in India. Yet we do have issues in the U.S., issues \"like that.\" We have mass murderer Elliot Rodger, who before he killed six people and injured 14 others in Isla Vista California last year, wrote his own 137-page version of that same misogynist script. We know from \"The Hunting Ground,\" documentarian Kirby Dick's film about sexual assault on college campuses -- also now in theaters -- that multitudes of women, and many men, have had violated their right to an education free from violence. We know that women are leaving the tech industry, Wall Street, and Internet feminism in droves due to untenable discrimination and violence. We know that women (and people of all genders) are assaulted by strangers and intimates every day. And what of the response? As Zak Cheney-Rice noted, discussing \"India's Daughter\" in Mic.com, \"from India to the U.S., citizens and officials alike display a troubling inclination to sympathize with rapists and vilify their victims.\" A United Nations report released last week, marking the 20th anniversary of the landmark women's rights conference in Beijing, confirms that (as The New York Times put it) \"violence against women -- including rape, murder and sexual harassment -- remains stubbornly high in countries rich and poor, at war and at peace.\" Everywhere. We can't relegate such violence to \"the other,\" to the \"not here, not us, not me.\" To do so is not only incorrect, it is damaging. Yes, we must be concerned for the human rights of all the world's citizens. Yes, violence against women varies in form and degree. But to imagine that violence against women happens only, or mostly, \"somewhere else,\" is exactly what keeps the culture of violence alive at home. Concern for others does not absolve us of responsibility for ourselves. Likewise, the extreme actions or words of a few marquee misogynists, wherever they live, do not absolve us. We must all ask ourselves: To what degree do we repeat those scripts, or stay silent when we hear them from others? Our actions, and inactions, fuel the culture from which both extreme and everyday violence and discrimination emerge. We cannot furrow our brows about India, or any of those \"others\" -- abusive men in fraternities, for example -- and be done. Indeed, \"India's Daughter\" premiered in the U.S. with the intent of drawing attention to gender inequality and sexual violence worldwide. So let's bring about the day when the next buzzworthy documentary is about the women and men and allies of all genders who have stepped up, together, to say no more: not in my home, not in my school, not in my country, not anywhere.","highlights":"Phoebe Schreiner: We react in horror at comments in BBC doc where India rapist says women err in fighting back .\nBut she says Americans should look inward at their own tolerance for violence against women, demonstrated in sobering assault stats .\nSchreiner: We dodge accountability for misogyny and sexual abuse in our own culture by focusing on countries that are \"the other\""}

Liverpool U21s winger Harry Wilson scores from the penalty spot against Chelsea to put his side 1-0 up . Chelsea had started the brighter of the two sides and should have perhaps taken an early lead through Issiah Brown, but he could not direct an awkwardly bouncing ball into the net. That early scare prompted a response from the Reds though and Cameron Brannagan sent Sergi Canos through on goal soon after, although the Spaniard dragged his shot wide. The deadlock was broken when Sinclair powered his way into the Chelsea box in the eighth minute and was fouled by Fikayo Tomori, with Wilson scoring the ensuring spot kick. The second goal followed a similar routine - Sinclair's surging pace duped Tomori again and the young striker, dancing along the byline before whipping in from a seemingly impossible angle, was able to add to his already impressive scoring tally for the season.

Somersby ran a tremendous race to fill the runner-up spot, beaten a length and a quarter. Defending champion Sire De Grugy was under the pump a long way from home, while Sprinter Sacre, so brilliant in this race two years ago, did not jump well and appeared a shadow of his former self after stopping quickly from the home turn and being pulled up.

Twiston-Davies said: 'What a horse, Harry Derham and the team have done a great job - Harry rides him all the time wouldn't let Frankie Dettori ride him at home when he came down the other day, which says a lot. 'I need to get my breath back, I'm shaking a bit! 'I missed two out a bit, I was almost going too well.' Nicholls said: 'That was absolutely awesome. 'It's good for the owners and good for the team. 'The progress he's made has been absolutely phenomonal. 'He's got better and better.' Dodging Bullets returned at 9-2 after landing the Queen Mother Champion Chase . Twiston-Davies celebrates with the Queen Mother Champion Chase trophy . Dettori said: 'Sam gave him a fantastic ride. He jumped like a stag. 'He was meant to win a Derby but this is second best. 'My legs were shaking a little bit. What a horse.' Nicholls went on: 'He should have been favourite on form. 'I couldn't see why the other two (Sprinter Sacre and Sire De Grugy) were ahead of him in the market. 'Progressive horses usually come out on top. 'We know where we are going with him now. He's such a special horse.' Winning owner Martin Broughton said: 'The anticipation is almost too much, and when you get to the race itself, you just want them to come back safe. 'All the way round I got more and more confident. It was all going exactly to plan. 'This is fantastic. I'm absolutely ecstatic. 'It's all been Sprinter versus Sire. I'm happy under the radar.' It was all smiles for the connections of Dodging Bullets . Nicky Henderson said Sprinter Sacre will be given a thorough check-up before he can consider any notion of retirement for the former champion chaser. Henderson said: 'His heart is OK, which is the main thing. 'He'll be scoped and then we'll know a lot more after that. 'Barry said he was a bit noisy going up the back and it sounds like it's something internal. 'We'll scope him now. There was a trace of blood after Ascot, so you would have to be suspicious in that department. 'Once we've done the tests we'll let everyone know. 'We've only just unsaddled and are trying to gather our thoughts. 'I don't think we can make any predictions today as to the future. 'If there's a switch we can find that gets rids of what is affecting him today, who knows.' Frankie Dettori (second right) couldn't hide his excitement after Dodging Bullets' victory . Mick Channon, trainer of Festival veteran Somersby, said: 'He's been in great form, it was only really the race at Ascot (Clarence House) where he disappointed. He has run pound for pound to his Tingle Creek form and run his race - I'm delighted for everybody.' Trainer Gary Moore felt a brisk surface counted against fourth-placed Sire De Grugy. 'The ground wasn't soft enough for him,' said the West Sussex handler. 'He showed at Chepstow how good he was when it's deep, but on ground like this, he wants two and a half miles these days.' Henry de Bromhead was thrilled with the effort of Special Tiara. He said 'I'm delighted with that run, Noel (Fehily) gave him a super ride. He got him filled up coming round home turn and coming to the second-last he thought he might win, but then he just petered out. 'To be fair he is better on a flatter track, but he has run a blinder and we are delighted. 'He's a good ground horse and we will look at Sandown or Punchestown, whichever one Dodging Bullets doesn't go for.' De Bromhead also saddled former winner Sizing Europe, who was seventh, beating home Mr Mole. He said: 'Johnny (Burke) didn't knock him around when he knew he was beaten. I have thought about retiring him, but I'm not going to make any decisions until I have spoken to the owners. 'The fact he has come back so many times just shows how he has stood the test of time.'","highlights":"Dodging Bullets wins race on Ladies Day at Cheltenham 2015 .\nSprinter Sacre and Sire De Grugy were fancied for the feature race .\nBut Dodging Bullets beat Somersby and Special Tiara .\nSprinter Sacre, ridden by Barry Geraghty, was pulled up .\nThe win was a second of the day for Sam Twiston-Davies .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest from the Cheltenham Festival ."}
{"article":"(CNN)The Chinese government has declared the Internet to be the new battlefield in its fight against \"pornography and unlawful information.\" The chilling reality is that the main casualty of this cyberwar is freedom of expression. China's Internet model is one of extreme control. The authorities use an army of censors to stifle dissent. In January, the Orwellian \"State Internet Information Office\" announced it had shut down scores of websites and more than 100 social media accounts for \"distorting history of the Communist Party and the nation.\" Under the guise of a campaign to ensure social stability, the Chinese authorities suppress online debate on a range of legitimate issues. Dozens of phrases are censored on social media including any mention of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown or the recent Hong Kong pro-democracy protests. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter remain blocked. While the new battlefield is virtual, the impact on people's lives is real and devastating. Since President Xi Jinping came to power, hundreds of people have been detained solely for expressing their peaceful views online. It is women's rights activists, anti-corruption and environmental campaigners, and those urging debate on political and legal reforms who fall foul of online censors. Su Changlan was detained by police in October 2014. Her apparent \"crime\" was to have posted comments online in support of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests. She faces charges of \"inciting subversion of state power,\" and a potential sentence of life imprisonment. Liu Ping, a 45-year-old mother and grassroots activist, languishes in jail right now. Last June, she was sentenced to six years in prison on the charge of \"picking quarrels and provoking troubles\" for publicly calling on the Chinese government to step up the fight against corruption. Liu Ping's online posts of photos of her holding banners calling for transparency, and transcripts of Skype chats with foreign media, were used to condemn her at her trial. The paradox is that President Xi has made great mileage out of his own anti-corruption drive. The persecution of Liu Ping, and many others that raise these issues only underlines the hypocrisy of the current leadership. This online attack is part of the worst crackdown against freedom of expression in China in more than a decade. Under President Xi, it is an assault on all fronts: in academia, in the media, civil society and online. Ilham Tohti, an economics professor at Central University for Nationalities in Beijing and the founder of the \"Uyghur Online\" website was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2014 on charges of \"separatism.\" The charge was based on his online articles, university lectures and interviews with foreign media. He worked to peacefully build bridges between ethnic communities and often criticized government policies that promoted discrimination. I have not seen evidence that his words did otherwise. The Chinese authorities abuse the law to suppress online freedom and target critical voices, yet have the guile to portray such persecution as evidence of the rule of law in action. Far from relenting, the government is introducing a swath of regressive legislation and regulations in a further assault against online privacy and freedom of expression. A new, vaguely worded draft anti-terror law lacks sufficient safeguards and gives the authorities virtually a free rein to collect information on individuals' online activities. All Internet and telecommunication service providers operating in China would be required to give the government backdoor access to their systems and details about the encryption used. Yes, the government has a responsibility to ensure national security and to combat serious crime, but such measures must be targeted and proportionate to the threat. Internet companies doing business in China must also take all possible efforts to avoid contributing to human rights abuses. At the international level the Chinese government looks to legitimize its actions. China's charismatic \"Internet Czar,\" Lu Wei,  extolls the concept of \"internet sovereignty\" and promotes it as an acceptable global model. This initiative must not go unchallenged. Internet sovereignty in China equals censorship and persecution; a web to trap thousands of individuals peacefully expressing different views online. While the immediate outlook is bleak, there is hope. The Internet has proved invaluable to the development of human rights -- revolutionizing access to information and improving transparency and accountability. For every online critic the Chinese authorities imprison, there are scores more prepared to speak out despite the risks. It is with these courageous individuals that those of us who value online freedom must stand united. The battle to promote Internet sovereignty and silence all critical voices is one the Chinese authorities must not be allowed to win. The opinions expressed here are solely those of the author .","highlights":"China's Internet model is one of extreme control, says Amnesty's East Asia director .\nChinese authorities suppress online debate on a range of legitimate issues, she says .\nWhile the battlefield is virtual, the impact on people's lives is real and devastating, she adds."}
{"article":"(CNN)The expulsions of two students by the University of Oklahoma for their role in a racist chant will likely not be the last word on the scandal. The Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity members can appeal the decision. More students might be expelled. And beyond the immediate issues around the now infamous incident, the university could experience a trickle-down impact for months, maybe years to come. Writing to the two students Tuesday, just two days after a video of frat members singing the racist song surfaced, OU President David Boren said they were being booted for \"leading a racist and exclusionary chant which has created a hostile educational environment for others.\" They were given until close of business Friday to contest the decision. No word yet on whether either will. CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin said she believes there will be a constitutional challenge to the expulsions. \"It's sort of one of the first things you learn in law school ... you may disapprove of what someone says but you still defend their right to say it,\" she said. Hostin added: \"I think there'll be the arguments that these students were students, and that in our educational systems we want people to have, maybe, even a heightened level of freedom of speech.\" Also unknown at this point is whether other students who appear in the video will be expelled or otherwise punished. Already, the Greek letters sigma, alpha and epsilon have been removed from the frat house's facade, the house will be closed as of midnight Tuesday and the university will board up the windows, following up on separate decisions by the university and the SAE national headquarters to shutter the Oklahoma chapter, Boren said. Sigma Alpha Epsilon is no stranger to scandal and sanctions . But he seemed to say that individual punishments could be a bit trickier. \"Well, legally, our concern is we have to demonstrate exactly how the educational experience of our students was threatened or disrupted by their actions,\" Boren said, \"and it really has to focus on the students on the bus. Did the other students have their educational experience disrupted?\" While he unwaveringly declared \"there is no room for racists and bigots\" at his university, the very thing that could keep the SAE fraternity brothers Oklahoma Sooners is Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The law \"prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance,\" but it also provides the parameters for determining if someone is violating the federal law, Boren said. Any punishment must be \"carefully directed\" if it's to pass constitutional muster, although he made it clear he hopes some of the students involved won't wait for legal issues to be sorted out. \"I think some of the students themselves may take themselves off the campus, and I hope they do because this is not a place that wants racists,\" he said. So far, no students have dropped out -- voluntarily -- but the video has cost the university's football team a top recruit as offensive lineman Jean Delance said Monday he was de-committing from the Sooners and considering other teams. It's an issue that Ber Thaddeus Bailey, director of diversity, OU student government, worries about. \"I am concerned about the trickle-down effect from this incident,\" he said. \"I do want to encourage those who are considering the University of Oklahoma that this is a great place to study, and we are going to continue to progress.\" CNN's Chris Cuomo contributed to this report.","highlights":"The University of Oklahoma president says chant created a \"hostile educational environment\"\nTwo students are expelled; they have until Friday to appeal ."}

The rapper had denied copying instrumental 'Lilith \u2014 on the way' \u00a0in his 2013 song 'Versus'. But he has now agreed to pay 50 per cent of the royalties to the Swiss pianist and saxophonist, following an 18-month legal wrangle. Scroll down for video . Settled: US rapper Jay-Z, pictured here with wife\u00a0Beyonc\u00e9, has agreed to pay Swiss musician half of royalties from a song in which he lifted an instrumental . Royalties:\u00a0Swiss jazz musician Bruno Spoerri has been awarded 50 per cent of royalties from Jay-Zs song 'Versus' after rapper admitted using music without permission . It comes just days after Marvin Gaye's family were awarded $7.4 million after a jury decided that the Robin Thicke song 'Blurred Lines' ripped off Gaye's 1977 hit 'Got to Give It Up'. The song made a staggering $16million for producer Pharrell Williams, Thicke and rapper T.I. with the\u00a0family being awarded $4million in damages and $3.4 million in profits from the song. An attorney for Thicke and Pharrell has said a decision in favour of Gaye's heirs could have a chilling effect on musicians who try to emulate an era or another artist's sound. In this case, the lifted melody came from a song composed by Spoerri in 1978, with the musician rejecting an initial offer as 'too low'. Out of pocket: Musician Jay-Z, pictured here at the opening of a club, \u00a0has agreed to pay Swiss musician half of royalties from one of his songs . The American musician and record producer only admitted using the music without attribution a few months ago, according to reports. Speaking last year, the veteran jazz musician said legal proceedings could have been avoided with a phone call. 'In a way I'm flattered that a relatively young rapper takes a sample from an old man, a sample that is about 35 years old,' he told\u00a0swissinfo.ch. 'On the other hand I'm furious because it would have been so simple to clear the sample. All it would have needed was a call or an email to the company and I think it would have been relatively cheap.' Mr Spoerri, 79, has worked with the likes of Lee Konitz, Hans Kennel and George Gruntz in a career spanning nearly 50 years. In an illustrious career, he has directed the Zurich jazz festival and music schools in Zurich and Lucerne.","highlights":"Rapper initially denied copying melody from Bruno Spoerri's 1978 tune .\nBut has now agreed to give veteran musician half of royalties .\nSpoerri has directed the Zurich jazz festival and prestigious music schools .\nIt follows Blurred Lines ruling awarding Marvin Gaye's family $7.4m ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Well, it was weird while it lasted. On Wednesday, lawmakers in Ireland rushed to close a loophole that temporarily made it legal to possess Ecstasy, crystal methamphetamine, ketamine, magic mushrooms and a host of other recreational drugs. The loophole was inadvertently opened the day before, when an appeals court invalidated one section of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977. The court ruled that Irish governments had been unconstitutionally adding substances to Section 2 of the law for decades. \"We prepared for this possibility. Legislation was prepared and approved in advance by Cabinet,\" Minister for Health Leo Varadkar said in a written statement. \"The emergency legislation ... will re-instate the status quo ante and re-control all drugs that were controlled prior to this judgment.\" The emergency law moved through the Irish legislature and was signed by the President on Wednesday, meaning that the drugs would become illegal to possess again at midnight, a Department of Health spokeswoman told CNN. Varadkar said the temporarily legalized substances -- which include a wide array of synthetic or \"head shop\" drugs -- \"all have very significant health risks that outweigh any perceived recreational benefits,\" according to the Irish Times. The original schedule of substances listed in the 1977 law -- including cannabis, cocaine and heroin -- were untouched by the appeals court ruling and remained illegal. Varadkar also told the Irish Times that the court ruling could affect \"dozens\" of cases, although The Journal of Ireland said the court's decision will affect only cases now in the judicial process.","highlights":"The president signs emergency legislation .\nThe loophole opened when an appeals court struck down part of Ireland's drug law ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Many years ago, a colleague told me how frustrated her husband was by \"Amazon Mom,\" a special membership program offered by the retail giant that provides discounts, recommendations and other information to help parents during the crazy toddler years. In bold print, the company says the program is \"open to anyone, whether you're a mom, dad, grandparent, or caretaker.\" But still it is called \"Amazon Mom,\" irking my colleague's husband to no end since he was the one ordering the majority of diapers and other products for their babies. 'Dad' gets a makeover in Super Bowl ads . My friend's husband was not alone. A petition created a few years ago calls on Amazon to change the name of the program from \"Amazon Mom\" to \"Amazon Family.\" But the drive didn't get much traction. That changed after the recent death of a beloved dad blogger, Oren Miller, who created a Facebook group for dad bloggers in 2012 that has grown to more than 1,000 members. In 2013, Miller called on men and women to sign the petition to get Amazon to change the name of the program. \"Why did Amazon bother changing the name of its parenting program when the program started in the UK? What made them realize they couldn't get away with calling it 'Amazon Mom,' and why do they get away with it here?\" Miller wrote. \"Someone actually started a petition to change the name to 'Amazon Family' in the US, and so far it has less than 100 signatures. Why is that? Why are we OK with letting England be more progressive than we are here when it comes to fatherhood? They have a queen! They are ruled by a freakin' queen! We can do better than that!\" he wrote. No more dumb old dad: Changing the bumbling father stereotype . I had the pleasure of interviewing Miller for a story last year on whether modern dads get enough credit. The 42-year-old stay-at-home father of two, who fought perceptions of fathers as nothing more than babysitters in essays on his blog, was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2014. Miller, of Owings Mills, Maryland, died Saturday. Now, members of the dad blogging community are rallying in his honor, trying to step up the pressure on the Internet powerhouse to finally change the name of its program and get with the times. Mike Heenan, a stay-at-home father of two in Northern California and founder of the blog At-Home Dad Matters, never got to meet Miller but says that when Miller welcomed him into his community of dad bloggers, it changed his life. \"He got me writing again, inspired me to publish, to contribute, to tell my story ... to be a better dad for my daughters.\" Heenan, like several other dad bloggers, took to Twitter using the #AmazonFamilyUS hashtag to call for Amazon to make the change. \"The push for inclusivity in the parenting arena has been well received by many a brand in the past few years and, like Oren, many of us think the change to 'Amazon Family' is a no-brainer,\" Heenan said. Judgy moms and dads face off in hit ad . Buzz Bishop, a father of two in Calgary, Alberta, and founder of the blog Dad Camp, points out how Amazon calls its program \"Amazon Family\" in Germany, Japan, Austria, France and Canada as well as the United Kingdom. \"So why is it called 'Amazon Mom' in America?\" Bishop wrote in a blog post. \"We are continuing a cause that was once championed by the creator of the Dad Bloggers Facebook group, Oren Miller,\" wrote Bishop. \"In his name, we want to finish the job.\" The petition has gotten over 4,800 signatures. Amazon has not commented on the movement. In the meantime, Miller's supporters won't stop pushing. I hope they never do.

{"article":"Hong Kong (CNN)Taipei is fast becoming the go-to Asian city for some of Hollywood's biggest hitters. Martin Scorsese is filming his latest opus \"Silence\" there, and French director Luc Besson chose Taipei over seven other Asian cities for his sci-fi thriller \"Lucy,\" starring Scarlett Johansson. And this May \"The Walking Dead\" star Andrew Lincoln will begin filming in the city for a movie project. Tasked with attracting international film makers, Jennifer Jao, head of the Taipei Film Commission, said that 92 foreign film crews shot in the city last year, up from 56 in 2013. \"We hope the whole island can be like a big studio,\" she told CNN while in Hong Kong Thursday. It wasn't always this way. For years, Taiwan, while home to acclaimed filmmakers like Edward Yang and Hou Hsiao-hsien, was overlooked in favor of its ritzier neighbors Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo. And even when Hollywood came knocking, the city didn't always have its act together. The producers of \"Mission Impossible III,\" released in 2006, had wanted to film at Taipei 101, at that time the world's tallest skyscraper. But faced with red tape and reluctance, they ended up choosing the 53-story Shanghai Bank of China Tower for Tom Cruise's memorable bungee jump. \"We lost an opportunity for the world to get to know Taipei,\" says Jao. Jao's commission was set up in 2008 to court international film makers but it wasn't until director Ang Lee, who was born in Taiwan, filmed the Oscar-winning hit \"Life of Pi\" on the island that it began to earn a reputation as an accommodating and affordable place to shoot. Lee filmed the memorable and technically difficult scenes of a shipwrecked boy and a tiger at a purpose-built facility at abandoned airport in the Taiwanese city of Taichung. With its relatively unknown cityscape, Taiwan can also function as a generic Asian backdrop. The island, which was a Japanese colony, is already being used as a stand-in for Japan. Japanese director Takashi Miike used Taiwan's high-speed rail system in a bullet-strewn action sequence for crime drama \"Shield of Straw,\" which competed at the Cannes International Film Festival. Japanese rail authorities turned him away. And Scorsese's \"Silence,\" due to release in 2016, is a historic drama about two Jesuit priests who travel to Japan. Taiwan is also a popular alternative to China, where there are many restrictions on filmmakers -- authorities can censor scripts considered politically sensitive or obscene. Hong Kong director John Woo used both Taiwan and China as locations in \"The Crossing.\" Dubbed China's \"Titanic,\" it focuses on a ship that sank when the Nationalist government fled China for Taiwan in 1949 as the Communists took over -- a sensitive period in Chinese history. Taiwan and China are still governed separately. Chinese authorities asked Woo to tone down the heroics of a Nationalist soldier, according to the South China Morning Post -- not something that Taiwan would ever require, says Jao. The commission offers incentives for international film crews. Up to $2 million is available per movie -- half of that as a cash subsidy. But just as important is the island's versatility as a location, says Jao. While many of the film crews are from neighboring Asian countries, the city has hosted crews from Latvia and Germany, while the BBC shot some of its newly released drama \"X+Y\" in the city. \"It's a small island. Within half an hour, you can go from the streets to the mountains to the sea.\"","highlights":"Taipei is attracting more international film crews .\nMartin Scorsese is shooting his latest movie in the city .\nTaiwan often acts as a stand in for China and Japan ."}

Jedinak had until 6pm on Tuesday night to appeal against the charge - a move which would have made him available to face Southampton - but he decided to accept it at the risk of a lengthier ban for a frivolous appeal. As the 30-year-old Australian has already been sent off this season - against Sunderland - he has been given a four-match ban, the FA confirmed on Tuesday afternoon. Mile Jedinak's elbow clearly makes contact with the face of Diafra Sakho after the ball had gone . As well as missing the trip to Southampton on Tuesday night, Jedinak is banned for Palace's home match against QPR on March 14, an away fixture at Stoke on March 21 and Manchester City's visit to Selhurst Park on April 6. The incident occured in the 87th-minute of Palace's 3-1 win at Upton Park on Saturday and was picked up by Sky Sports' TV cameras. Manager Alan Pardew on Monday bemoaned the extra scrutiny added to games that are shown live on TV. Jedinak celebrates with Jason Puncheon (right) and Glenn Murray after Palace's first goal on Saturday . 'The punditry seems to be having a greater effect on the decision process at the FA.

{"article":"Kano, Nigeria (CNN)More than 50 people were killed and scores wounded in a series of suicide bombings in northern Nigeria on Saturday, witnesses and authorities told CNN. The blasts occurred in Maiduguri, the capital of the tumultuous Borno state, at the city's main market, a fish market and a bus station. Four suicide bombers -- three women and a man -- carried out the attacks, according to witnesses. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the bloodshed. But the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram has been behind many similar attacks in northern Nigeria and beyond, killing hundreds in recent months as part of its terrorist campaign to bring its twisted version of Sharia law to the region. Clement Adoda, a Borno state police spokesman, said at least 54 people were killed and another 139 wounded in the suicide attacks. Suleiman Bulunkutu said he and others involved in the rescue operation had taken about 50 bodies to the Maiduguri General Hospital morgue. \"This toll doesn't include those taken to three other hospitals,\" Bulunkutu said. \"Therefore, the\u200e final (death) toll may be higher.\" In the first blast, a woman dressed in a hijab got off a motorized rickshaw and blew herself up outside the Baga Road fish market around 11:20 a.m. (5:20 a.m. ET), fish trader Mohammed Boni said. The next attack took place about an hour later outside Monday Market, the main one in the city, where people were lined up to go through security. Those measures -- in which people are checked for explosives and guns -- were set up because of the spate of Boko Haram attacks in the city and region. Two women joined the female security line, one of whom \"blew herself up, causing minimal casualty,\" said witness Abdulkarim Musa. Then, as people gathered to help, the second woman detonated her explosives, said Musa, who was waiting outside the market in the male security line. The third attack occurred at a bus station. \"He came in our midst near the bus station and pressed a remote device he was holding in his hand,\" a wounded survivor who requested anonymity for his personal safety said from Maiduguri General Hospital. Such attacks, sadly, are nothing new for Borno State, one of those hit hardest by Boko Haram and the Nigerian military's campaign to stop them. The terrorist group has not only bombed crowded markets but attacked churches and mosques, raided villages, and kidnapped people young and old -- most famously the more than 200 girls taken last April from a school in Chibok.","highlights":"Police official: At least 54 are killed and 139 wounded .\n3 of the 4 suicide bombers were females, witnesses say .\nThe attack happened in a region terrorized by Boko Haram ."}

Why are there still away players on there? They should be punished for it. \u2018These people on the pitch are not true supporters, the true fans are the ones who are booing to get them off.\u2019 Former Liverpool star and TV pundit Mark Lawrenson added: \u2018It\u2019s like a scene from the 1980s all over again.

{"article":"(CNN)In a side room at the American University of Nigeria, four girls chat and giggle. One teenage girl in particular catches our attention. She looks familiar. Then we realize why. We met her just a few weeks after Boko Haram had attacked her school and abducted almost 300 students. As the Boko Haram trucks carrying them began to speed away to the militants' territory, she and her friend bravely jumped, barely escaping with their lives. She was one of the lucky ones. School, she says, from that day on became a reminder of what almost happened. A place she never wanted to return. But now she is back and the change in her is remarkable. She dreams of remaining in the classroom as a teacher, so that just like her tutors, she can influence and inspire young minds. Studying with her here are 21 other girls from Chibok. They, too, escaped Boko Haram. Like hundreds of others across Nigeria's North East, they were targeted simply for going to school. Choosing to go back to class is a statement of their courage and focus on education, which they hope will bring change back home. \"My people need my support,\" one girl says. \"And me going to school will make that change,\" She wants to be a surgeon. In a part of the world often lacking the most basic health care infrastructure, she has chosen to bring value to her community. One of three students we spoke to who want to study medicine, she's extraordinarily focused and firm in her responses. It is hard to imagine sitting with her now what she and the other girls have been through at Boko Haram's hands, what they almost lost. Some questions, though, they can't answer: any questions about the night of the attack, any reference to the friends still missing. These are too hard. Enrolled on scholarships at the university, these girls are the lucky ones, and they know it. There are 46 other Chibok girls who also escaped Boko Haram, but there are no funds available to pay for their education. Dr. Margee Ensign, the school's vice-chancellor, is hoping to change that by raising funds through the university's foundation. \"The world paid, and rightly so, a lot of attention to the close to 300 that were kidnapped,\" she says. \"We heard through various people that some had escaped that night and when it came to our attention that about a dozen wanted to come to AUN, we thought, we can do that!\" She did more then just raise the funds. When the parents agreed to release their girls into her care, she and her security director traveled -- just the two of them -- to the outskirts of Chibok to go and get the girls, in spite of the insecurity. Even on campus, though, the specter of Boko Haram is never far away. The American University is in Adamawa state, one of the states in North East Nigeria that is under a state of emergency. This calls for constant vigilance at the school: Cars are searched by hand and guards and sniffer dogs are on constant patrol. For the girls, to remain in school, they must draw upon all their reserves of courage. It is a reality these extraordinarily self-possessed young ladies softly acknowledge. When I ask how it is they are able to persevere, one girl says with a slight smile, \"I'm very brave and determined.\" She really is. All the girls are. But they're hoping a day will come when they won't have to be.","highlights":"Nigerian girls escaped after Boko Haram abducted them from school .\nThey hope to help their country by finishing their education ."}
{"article":"(CNN)As a November dawn breaks over an Irish bar in downtown New York, the early risers inside are hunkered down to watch Lewis Hamilton begin his chase for a second Formula One world title. It's mid-morning in Brazil and Melissa, her husband Alex and their four-year-old daughter are also glued to the TV to watch their hero in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. On the verdant Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean, three thousand miles from the desert showdown, another Hamilton fan anxiously waits for the Mercedes man to race to his fate. These supporters, and others around the world from Estonia to South Africa, had voiced their hopes in video messages and their supplications on social media. When Hamilton flicked down his visor, revved the Mercedes' engine and hit the throttle, a global surge of support roared. \"We came out at 6am on Sunday morning to watch the race in a bar in Manhattan,\" New Yorker, and self confessed No.1 Hamilton fan, Christopher Thomas told CNN. \"We met up with fans from all over; we had a guy from the UK and one guy even took a bus from Boston just to watch the race. \"We also made videos and sent them to Lewis' website using the hashtag TeamLH.\" In Brazil, self-styled Melissa \"Hamilton,\" who is married to Alex \"Senna,\" also used the hashtag to communicate with her idol. She told CNN: \"I support Lewis every day but during the races I am aware of everything, even practice and all the interviews. \"At all times he knows he can count on our support, in good times or bad. I am extremely proud to be a fan of his.\" When Hamilton won in Abu Dhabi -- in easier circumstances than expected thanks to an engine problem for rival Nico Rosberg -- and sealed the 2014 championship he was quick to thank his fans in the post-race media conference. \"I always say we win and lose together,\" he smiled. \"The love and energy that I get from my fans... It really made me believe that I can do anything.\" Racing in a global championship has helped Hamilton gain fame across international borders. In 2015, the F1 series will visit an air-mile clocking 20 countries. But when the 30-year-old Briton lines up for Sunday's season-opening Australian Grand Prix, he will do so as the most famous face on the grid. \"Lewis has over three million Facebook fans -- with a third of those coming from the UK -- and he has 2.6 million Twitter followers,\" explained Jon Stainer, managing director of leading sports and entertainment market research company Repucom. \"He has a very strong following. Compared to other F1 drivers, Lewis is also right up there in most of the sport's key markets in terms of celebrity awareness. \"In the big markets -- Brazil, China, India and the UK -- he scores in the top three. Fernando Alonso is the only other [ever-present] driver.\" Tom Roope, whose company Rumpus Room runs Hamilton's digital media, decided to tap into the racing star's global appeal in the build-up to the sizzling Abu Dhabi finale. \"We saw that Lewis' fans were talking to one another and so we came up with the protocol #TeamLH,\" explains Roope. Rumpus Room then devised a real time app, which enabled them to record and upload video messages of support.  These twin projects enabled Roope and his team to have a better understanding of the geography and demographic of Hamilton's followers. \"His fanbase is enormously international,\" he said. \"Around 50% of them are from the UK but then there are a lot in Asia, Brazil and the U.S. 30,000 fans uploaded videos from 50 countries. \"There was also a surprisingly high female following, which is probably connected to [his former girlfriend popstar] Nicole Scherzinger.\" The video messages was then edited into four films, which were broadcast daily on Hamilton's social platforms over the race weekend. The final film on race day had a million views on Facebook in one day alone. Our story. Here it is. #TeamLHmovie. Thank you all so much #TeamLH @mercedesamgf1 . https:\/\/t.co\/HbuiT4jRrw . Hamilton himself explained the concept, and the emotional response it generated within him, after the race. \"This weekend the guy who does my website put together a collage of different clips of messages from people,\" he said. \"I really didn't know what to expect. When I got it there was something happening in my heart. I can't really explain it.\" Thomas and his fianc\u00e9e Julliana Sanchez, as well as Melissa and her family and the Reunion Island fan, were featured in the films. \"It was important to us personally,\" Thomas said. \"It's a big deal for us making a video and seeing him acknowledge his fans.\" Thomas, who is originally from Guyana in South America, has also been galvanizing global support for Hamilton through social media for the last five years. He explained: \"The idea percolated at the Canadian Grand Prix in 2010. My brother-in-law Shaka had a huge painted banner -- it looked like something a five-year-old did -- but at the bottom it said '#LewisNation -- We Believe.' \"We started using it and Twitter was soon blown up with #LewisNation. The initial idea was to unite crew members in North America but when I go on Twitter and Facebook I see people from India, the Philippines, the UK and Germany. \"It's a global base and we are trying to make it bigger. Right now, we use #LewisNation to meet up at races but we've started work on a website.\" Hamilton's mass appeal is not just because he's an F1 driver and now a double world champion. He has something the other 17 drivers simply don't have -- a narrative to rival a bestselling novel, a blockbuster script. Born in Stevenage, a commuter town 30 miles north of London, he broke boundaries when he debuted in 2007 as F1's first black driver. He revealed on his website when his career began he \"tried to ignore that fact\" but has now \"really started to appreciate the implications.\" Hamilton's mixed heritage -- his mother is white British and his father's family have roots in the Caribbean -- and a rags-to-riches success story have both helped him connect with a wider fanbase. \"There's a crossover that appeals to many, many backgrounds,\" said Thomas. \"He's diverse, but not just [in] race but in his social likings too. \"He hangs out with top celebrities like Jay-Z and Kanye West. This hip-hop style and the fact that he spends a lot of time in the U.S. make him one of the few drivers who actually appeals to Americans.\" Roope agreed: \"Lewis is a bit different. He invites a whole new set of people into F1, people who might be put off by the rich, white, middle-classness of it all.\" Hamilton has also always worn his heart on his sleeve against a backdrop of fierce racing rivalry -- usually with his teammates --- and an on-off romance with Scherzinger. There have been some mesmerizing moments on track, and some famous meltdowns off it. Perhaps most remembered was his outburst at the 2011 Monaco Grand Prix. Hamilton had been penalized by race stewards after finishing sixth and exclaimed to the media: \"It's an absolute frickin' joke. Maybe it's because I'm black. That's what Ali G says.\" Many of Hamilton's fans -- though not all -- warm to these moments of human frailty as much as his derring-do on the racetrack, and draw inspiration from both. Melissa races go karts in Brazil and, although she credits her husband Alex for his practical support, she also takes heart from Hamilton. \"Lewis is a fighter, he faced many prejudices and difficult days but he never gave up on his dream; he teaches us that,\" Melissa explained. \"In addition to his talent as a wonderful driver, he has a big heart, a great willpower. \"Many friends are astonished to see me kart racing because I dispute championships with many men, and women on the track are in the minority. \"I win often but women suffer some kind of prejudice. I do not really care, I care to always do my best and be inspired by the best drivers.\" Melissa has met Hamilton at many Brazilian Grands Prix. \"All my meetings with Lewis are fantastic and happy. He is a charismatic and kind person. He really loves his fans.\" Thomas, like Melissa, has met Hamilton \"tonnes of times\" in and around grand prix weekends. \"He seems like a down to earth guy,\" Thomas revealed. \"He's not one of those guys who signs an autograph and shoves it back to you. He actually talks and spends time with you.\" Thomas and his fianc\u00e9e Sanchez are so impressed with the British racer that they graced him with a special honor. \"The first person we invited verbally to our wedding was Lewis,\" Thomas explained. \"We met him in the pit lane at the U.S. Grand Prix last year, he hung out with us, took selfies and we alluded to the fact that we were getting married and said 'hey you're the first invite.' \"We are trying to set a date around the summer break. We can't set the date on a race weekend!\" Being a global personality offers the ability to change people's lives even in a small way but for Hamilton, the relationship he has with his fans appears to be mutualistic. \"Lewis is genuinely indebted to his fans,\" said Roope. \"He always sees his fans as the core of his powerbase.\" When he drives out of the garage in Australia, the world champion may be racing to end the season as No.1 but he also carries the hearts and hopes of millions. Does Lewis Hamilton have what it takes to transcend the track and become a global sporting superstar?

{"article":"New Delhi, India (CNN)Do not generalize India as a country of rapists. That was the firm message from the German ambassador in New Delhi after a professor back home was accused of turning down a male Indian student's application for an internship due to the South Asian nation's \"rape problem.\" Professor Annette Beck-Sickinger never did such a thing, according to her and the University of Leipzig. The university points out four of her 30 students and two of her laboratory interns come from India; while it wasn't clear how many of them were men, the university said 29 of its 44 Indian students total are male. Still, Beck-Sickinger has admitted making a mistake by engaging the rejected intern candidate with talk about rape in Indian society and how the issue spurred \"many (other) female professors in Germany (have) decided to no longer accept male Indian students for these reasons.\" \"It was never my intention to make a defamatory comment about Indian society,\" she said, according to a statement posted on the website of the University of Leipzig. \"I do not have anything against Indian students -- on the contrary. I sincerely apologize to anyone whose feelings I may have hurt.\" Marital rape: Why is it legal in India? The firestorm began with a recent post on the social-networking site Quora. It featured what appeared to be screenshots of email excerpts involving someone in the University of Leipzig's biochemistry department. They fell under this provocative headline: \"What should an Indian male student do if he is denied an internship opportunity on the basis of India being projected as an unsafe country for women?\" The post didn't identify Beck-Sickinger, blacking out the name of the emails' author. But it did lead with this statement that was later linked to her: \"Unfortunately I don't accept any Indian male students for internships. We hear a lot about the rape problem in India which I cannot support. I have many female students in the group, so I think this attitude is something I cannot support.\" The thing is, Beck-Sickinger says she \"never wrote\" such a message, claiming this email was \"put together from individual segments taken from different mails.\" \"I do not reject students because of reasons of race or gender, \" she added. \"I am by no means racist or xenophobic in any way.\" Here's what the University of Leipzig says did happen: The professor told the candidate \"the laboratories are fully occupied.\" The Indian applicant \"didn't accept\" this rejection, the university says, and went back-and-forth with Beck-Sickinger over email. During that exchange, Beck-Sickinger wrote things that she later regretted -- excerpts of which were posted to Quora and the university acknowledged as legitimate. Speaking about how Indian men might be stereotyped due to reports about alarming instances of rape in their native country, she said, \"I fully agree that this is a generalization and may not apply to individuals. However it is also unbelievable that the Indian society is not able to solve this problem for many years now.\" India bans rape documentary . Beck-Sickinger referred to regular reports of \"multi-rape crimes\" and abuse of female tourists that, \"for me ... demonstrate the attitude of society towards (women).\" Such incidents have moved other female professors to reject male Indians \"and currently other European female associations are joining.\" \"Of course we cannot change or influence the Indian society,\" she added, \"but only take our consequences here in Europe.\" The idea that the professor wouldn't accept male Indians for internships -- as reported by Quora and denied by the University of Leipzig -- riled up some in India, a number of whom wrote on the Quora thread. One user, identified as Sas Vijay, said, \"Don't leave this issue. It is a serious fault to generalize people on such grounds. File a complaint.\" Another user, posting as Hemanth Sriteja, wrote, \"I don't wanna come to an era where I should say 'Hii (sic), I'm from India, I'm not a rapist.\" One person echoing that view publicly is Michael Steiner, Germany's ambassador to India. \"Your oversimplifying and discriminating generalization is an offense to these women and men ardently committed to furthering women empowerment in India; and it is an offense to millions of law-abiding, tolerant, open-minded and hard-working Indians,\" Steiner wrote Monday in a letter posted on the embassy website. \"Let's be clear: India is not a country of rapists.\" The ambassador urged Beck-Sickinger \"to learn more about the diverse, dynamic and fascinating country and the many welcoming and open-minded people of India so that you could correct a simplistic image, which \u2014 in my opinion \u2014 is particularly unsuitable for a professor and teacher.\" CNN's Harmeet Shah Sing and journalist Kunal Sehgal reported from India, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta. CNN's Stephanie Halasz contributed to this report.","highlights":"Professor notes she has Indians in her class and interning at her laboratory .\nAn online post suggests a German professor rejected a student over India's \"rape problem\"\nProfessor denies this but does apologize for anyone \"hurt\" by her remarks on Indian society ."}
{"article":"Full-back Scott Grix made history with the quickest hat-trick from the start of a Super League match as Huddersfield made it three successive wins to climb up to fourth in the table. The Giants, who began the season with three straight defeats, never looked back after former Wakefield player Grix's three tries inside the first nine minutes helped put them 18-0 up and on their way to a fourth successive win at Belle Vue. Wakefield hit back to close the gap to four points early in the second half but further tries from two other Wakefield old boys, Danny Brough and Brett Ferres, plus others from Leroy Cudjoe and Ukuma Ta'ai, helped the visitors to a comfortable 44-14 victory. Scott Grix scored the quickest hat-trick from the start of a Super League match in Huddersfield's victory . It was a fourth straight defeat for the Wildcats, who had started the season with so much hope after gaining back-to-back wins, and drops them to the foot of the table. The match was memorable for Grix's early heroics but little else as both sides produced a string of errors to leave both coaches frustrated. The record for the fastest hat-trick of tries scored from the start of any match remains with Huddersfield's former player and current assistant coach Chris Thorman, who scored his within six minutes and 54 seconds of the Giants' National League Cup semi-final against Doncaster in 2002. Grix got his first after just 63 seconds after Brough had put second rower Ferres into a gap and finished off a flowing move for his second four minutes later. The 44-14 thrashing of Wakefield was Huddersfield's third win on the spin and moved them up to fourth . The former Wakefield full-back then gathered possession from Craig Hall's kick 20 metres from his own line and sprinted 80 metres for a glorious solo try to complete his treble. Brough kicked all three conversions to make it 18-0 but Wakefield, who gave debuts to centre Joe Arundel and forward George Griffin, gradually weathered the storm and scored two tries of their own in a nine-minute spell midway through the first half. Centre Dean Collis got the first after Huddersfield winger Aaron Murphy had made a hash of Tim Smith's high kick while veteran second rower Ali Lauititii proved impossible to tackle as he got skipper Danny Kirmond over. Hall was wide with both conversion attempts to leave the Wildcats trailing by 10 points, which is how it stayed until half-time despite both teams creating a host of chances. Wakefield's Dean Collis is tacked by Huddersfield Giants' Danny Brough (left) and Joe Wardle (right) Jack Hughes, drafted in at short notice when Chris Bailey pulled out of the Giants team for personal reasons and switched from second row to centre when winger Jermaine McGillvary went off with a shoulder injury on 17 minutes, was the biggest culprit, twice dropping the ball with the tryline beckoning. Brough regathered his own chip over the Wakefield defence but saw the final pass intercepted and prop Eorl Crabtree was held up over the line on his back while Wakefield forward Daniel Smith had a try chalked off for a forward pass. Wakefield winger Chris Riley was the next man to have a try disallowed early in the second half but there was no denying substitute Jordan Crowther when he was the first to reach the ball from Paul McShane's grubber kick. Hall's first goal cut the gap to just four points but Huddersfield were soon back in the ascendancy, with Ferres marking the 250th appearance of his career with their fourth try after taking Brough's short pass near the line. Brough kicked his sixth conversion before handing over the goalkicking duties to his half-back partner Jamie Ellis, who wrapped up the scoring with a penalty and conversion of Ta'ai's injury-time touchdown.","highlights":"Scott Grix scored quickest hat-trick from start of Super League match .\nHuddersfield Giants record their third straight victory .\nWin moves Huddersfield up to fourth in the Super League table ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Diplomacy can be dangerous. U.S. diplomats have come under attack in various places in the last few decades. Here's a look at U.S. diplomats who have been killed in the line of duty. The first U.S. ambassador assassinated while in office was John Gordon Mein, the U.S. ambassador to Guatemala. According to a telegram from the embassy in Guatemala City, a young man dressed in fatigues and carrying a sub-machine gun on  August 28, 1968, ordered Mein's vehicle to stop and for the ambassador to get out. He did, then ran -- prompting a cry of \"Shoot him, kill him.\" Mein was shot and fell to the ground about 12 yards behind his limousine. Cleo Noel Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Sudan, was nearing the end of a March 1973 reception in the Saudi Embassy in Khartoum when terrorists stormed in. The gunmen took Noel and another American, as well as diplomats from Saudi Arabia, Belgium and Jordan, according to a U.S. intelligence memo. The captors' demand: Free various people, mostly Palestinian guerillas, then imprisoned in Jordan, Israel and the United States. This spurred negotiations that didn't go anywhere, ending instead with the killing of Noel, fellow U.S. diplomat George Curtis Moore and Belgium's Charge d'Affaires. U.S. authorities say the assailants belonged to the Palestinian terrorist movement known as \"Black September,\" claiming that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat signed off on the attack. Ambassador Rodger Davies, who had been in Cyprus for less than months, hunkered down in a hallway on August 19, 1974, hoping he was safe from those involved in a nearby demonstration. Instead, a bullet penetrated the embassy compound and struck his heart, killing him instantly. Antoinette Varnava, a 31-year-old local who was part of the small embassy staff for about a decade, also died in the violence. U.S. ambassador to Lebanon Francis Meloy, his economic counselor Robert O. Waring and their Lebanese driver disappeared in June 1976 as they crossed the Green Line, the division between Beirut's Christian and Muslim sectors. Their bullet-riddled bodies were found a short time later in mainly Muslim west Beirut, which was then controlled by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's guerrillas. Two former Muslim guerillas were convicted in the kidnapping and killings, only to be freed in 1996. About eight months after President Jimmy Carter appointed him as U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Adolph Dubs was taken from his car while heading home from the embassy. His captors took the Foreign Service veteran to the Hotel Kabul, where Dubs died in a shootout between captors and Afghan police -- a violent death that, whomever fired the fatal bullets, the U.S. State Department considers an assassination. A former eight-story hotel facing the sea transformed into America's embassy in Beirut turned into a war zone in April 1983, when a truck loaded with explosives was rammed into its entrance. The result was horrific. Offices were pancaked on top of each other, the elevator shaft and stairwell destroyed, the cafeteria full of bodies and rubble, recalled the then U.S. ambassador Robert Dillon, who himself was dug out of the rubble. While 44 people inside the embassy survived the blast, 17 Americans, 25 Foreign Service nationals, 10 contract workers and 10 visa applicants and passerby did not. In 2008, Dillon said the attack was believed to have been carried out by a family \"under the direction of members of Iran's Revolutionary Guards.\" On August 7, 1998 -- around the exact same time a bomb went off at the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing 11 -- a huge explosion tore through the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya. The American Foreign Service Association (AFSA) lists eight people as having died in the attack on its memorial remembering Americans who died while serving the U.S. government abroad in a foreign affairs capacity.  Twelve Americans total were killed. Those are both jarring numbers, but they're still a fraction of the more than 200 people total killed in the attack, in addition to more than 4,000 wounded. In May 2001, a U.S. jury found four purported al Qaeda members guilty on all charges stemming from the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. As his wife of 34 years looked on, Laurence Foley was shot dead outside his home in Amman, Jordan, by a lone gunman in December 2002. A public servant for close to 40 years, the Boston-born Foley was serving as executive officer of the USAID mission in Amman at the time. U.S. officials were quick to label Foley's killing a murder, with the head of the AFSA calling it a \"brutal terrorist attack.\" They later implicated Iraqi-based terrorist leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi for providing \"financial and other support to the terrorists who assassinated\" Foley. Exactly 11 years after the September 11 attacks in New York, Washington and rural Pennsylvania, terrorists struck at Americans again -- this time some 5,000 miles away in the Libyan city of Benghazi. That's where Ambassador Christopher Stevens was when mortar and rocket fire struck a U.S. diplomatic annex there. Stevens didn't survive, nor did State Department computer expert Sean Smith or Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, two former U.S. Navy SEALs then acting as security contractors. The attack was first portrayed as violence by an angry mob responding to a video made in the U.S. that mocked Islam and the Prophet Mohammed. But officials later determined that it was a terrorist attack. Anne Smedinghoff, a 25-year-old public diplomacy officer at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, was delivering books to a school in southern Afghanistan when a suicide bomber smashed into her convoy. She died in that April 2013 attack, as did four others. \"We thought she was relatively safe in the embassy compound,\" her father Tom Smedinghoff told CNN. \"But as it turned out, Anne really wanted to do a lot more.\"","highlights":"Several U.S. diplomats have died after being attacked .\nThey include then-Ambassadors Christopher Stevens, John Mein and Francis Meloy ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Foreign intervention in Yemen's chaos has dramatically raised the stakes in the Arabian Peninsula, threatening to expand what is already a civil war into a conflict pitting Iran against Saudi Arabia and an Arab coalition. The Saudis launched Operation \"Decisive Storm\" last Wednesday with dozens of airstrikes in an effort to blunt the advance of Houthi militia and allied army units on the port of Aden -- and to protect the last bastion of Yemen's internationally-recognized President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. There were also strikes in and around the capital, Sanaa, which resumed early Monday. Many analysts were surprised at the speed and scale of the Saudi air campaign, which the Kingdom said would continue until the Houthis -- a Shia minority that has swept across the country in the last six months -- retreated and laid down their arms. Essentially the Saudis are trying to bomb the Houthis to the negotiating table. The Houthis have responded by threatening a campaign of suicide bomb attacks inside Saudi Arabia. Iran, which has supported the Houthis as fellow Shia, described the Saudi offensive as a \"dangerous move that would kill any chance at peaceful resolution of the crisis.\" Yemen is becoming the latest battleground in a contest for regional superiority between Saudi Arabia and Iran that goes back to the overthrow of the Shah during Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979. It now resembles Syria, or Bosnia 20 years ago: a patchwork of shifting fiefdoms where force is the only means of influence. There is a real risk that Yemen will collapse as a state, with a revived independence movement in the south, the Houthis in the north, and the Sunni heartland in between. Adam Baron, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations and expert on Yemen's tortured recent history, says, \"It's not difficult to divine Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners' motivations for taking this action.\" The Houthis were on the verge of overrunning Aden, a strategic port that overlooks straits through which 20,000 merchant ships pass every year. According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency, 3.8 million barrels of oil a day passed through the Bab el Mandab Straits in 2013. But Baron believes the Kingdom's \"decision to launch a full-scale military action truly risks inflaming the situation further. It will be seen as an act of aggression by most Yemenis and risks taking the situation to a place that no-one will be able to control.\" As in Afghanistan, factions in Yemen do not respond well to foreign intervention. In 2009 the Saudis took military action against the Houthis in support of then President Ali Abdullah Saleh, using airstrikes and special forces, but were unable to subdue them. Now the Houthis have at least some of the $500 million in military equipment provided by the U.S. to Yemen since 2010, and they have proved to be capable fighters. They staged a lightning invasion of the capital, Sanaa, last September, taking advantage of popular discontent and an unwillingness among many army units to resist them. Since then they have moved on the Red Sea port of Hodeida and surged south toward Aden. They have also grafted themselves onto parts of the army in the battle against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) that is now raging in central and southern Yemen. Whether Saudi and Egyptian ground forces will become involved in the conflict is the big unknown. An Arab League summit in Egypt at the weekend agreed to form a joint military force, but that will take months at least to build. In the meantime, Saudi tanks and armor have been moved closer to the Yemeni border, but Saudi officials say there are no immediate plans to launch a ground offensive. Yemen has history as a graveyard of foreign forces. In the 1960s Egypt intervened in Yemen's civil war on behalf of the anti-royalists -- an operation that sapped the Egyptian army and contributed to its failure against the Israelis in the 1967 war. The extent of the Houthis' backing from Iran is hotly disputed. President Hadi said at the weekend that Iran was behind Yemen's turmoil and the Houthis were no more than its stooges. The Houthis deny receiving help from Iran, but as the conflict worsens, they may indeed turn to Tehran for the sort of military advice that the Iranian Revolutionary Guards are providing in Iraq -- and for funding and oil. Saudi and Iranian involvement in Yemen threatens to deepen sectarian distrust in a country where Sunni and Shia have historically not been enemies. This would suit both AQAP and ISIS (Islamic State in Syria and Iraq) which announced its sudden and murderous arrival in Yemen this month with massive suicide bombings at two Houthi mosques in Sanaa, killing at least 150 people. As the International Crisis Group puts it, a \"long history of coexistence is beginning to break down\" in Yemen. Baron says one critical question is whether ISIS and AQAP will now go head-to-head in trying to kill as many Houthis as possible. For the United States, which worked hard to \"stand up\" the Hadi government and encourage its campaign to eradicate AQAP, recent events have been a disaster. There will be less actionable intelligence against one of al Qaeda's most potent affiliates, and its Sunni allies in the Middle East (and especially the Gulf) will have even less interest than before in dialogue with Iran on issues from its nuclear program to Iraq. U.S. options have also diminished with the hurried withdrawal of some 100 military personnel from al-Anad airbase in the south of Yemen hours before it was seized by the Houthis. Drone operations from the base had at least blunted AQAP's freedom of action, even if they failed to eradicate the group. The unseen hand in Yemen's collapse is former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was badly injured in a bomb attack in 2011, and eventually (very eventually) persuaded to cede office to Hadi after 33 years in power. But he was allowed to remain in the country and has not given up his political ambitions. Last fall, he was sanctioned by both the United Nations and the U.S. for undermining efforts to forge a new political settlement in Yemen. Baron believes Saleh is biding his time -- waiting for an opportunity to inject his son, Ahmed Ali, into Yemen's complex political equation. Ahmed Ali was formerly commander of Yemen's Republican Guard, and parts of the armed forces are still regarded as loyal to the Saleh clan. For now, Saleh has a marriage of convenience with the Houthis, but few expect it to survive. When he was President, Saleh launched a series of brief wars against the Houthis between 2004 and 2010. \"Neither trusts the other; their recent cooperation notwithstanding, they are competing for political dominance, especially in the northern tribal highlands and the military,\" says the International Crisis Group. For the people of Yemen, the brief flash of hope that came with the Arab Spring is now a distant memory. Last week, at least nine protesters were killed in the central city of Taiz and more than 100 injured by Houthi militia. Aden has been rocked by looting and score-settling among rival clans. \"Human rights in Yemen are in free-fall as even peaceful protest becomes a life-threatening activity,\" according to Said Boumedouha of Amnesty International. For the past three years, different parties and factions have fought over the state's few assets while the standard of living of ordinary Yemenis has continued to plummet. A U.N.-led effort to agree on a new constitution has been mired in squabbling, with all parties failing to honor commitments. \"Even more damaging, those with most influence -- the Saudis and Iranians in particular -- are taking steps to undercut the negotiations,\" says the International Crisis Group. \"This combination of proxy wars, sectarian violence, state collapse and militia rule has become sadly familiar in the region. Nobody is likely to win such a fight,\" the ICG says. But for now, such a fight seems destined to continue.","highlights":"Saudi Arabia-led coalition launched airstrikes in Yemen last Wednesday .\nSaudi intervention raises prospect of regional war between Iran and Arab states ."}
{"article":"Ashley Barnes says that he has laughed off allegations from Jose Mourinho that he was guilty of a 'criminal tackle' on Nemanja Matic when Burnley drew at Chelsea last month. Barnes' challenge was branded 'criminal' by Mourinho and Matic's retaliation saw him receive a red card during last month's 1-1 draw while the Burnley player was unpunished. It thrust Barnes and his club into the national spotlight and speaking about the incident for the first time to Burnley's programme for their match against Manchester City on Saturday, the 25-year-old striker explained how he dealt with the furore. Burnley forward Ashley Barnes attempts a shot as his side beat Manchester City 1-0 on Saturday evening . This studs-up tackle from Ashley Barnes infuriated Nemanja Matic at Stamford Bridge last month . Barnes closes down Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko during the Premier League clash on Saturday . The Burnley striker said: 'You're always going to get people who come out of the woodwork and voice their opinion. There were lots of comments made that it was a 'criminal tackle' and that it was disgusting but you just have to laugh it off really. 'Obviously I've not meant it. I give my all for the team but I'm an honest player. As I've gone to pass the ball he's come to try and screen in front of the strikers. I've took a heavy touch and as I've gone to pass to Jonesy (Dave Jones) I've caught him on the shin with the follow through of the pass. 'It wasn't intentional, of course. I would never go out on a football pitch to try and hurt an opponent. But there were so many different angles and it got picked out and scrutinised to the nth degree but you just have to get on with it. Martins Atkinson shows the red card to Matic after the Serbian pushed Barnes over in retaliation to the tackle . 'I don't really take anything from it. All I can do is apologise that I've caught him in that manner. As you can see nobody in the ground reacted and the next minute he came and pushed me over. Barnes said he was unaware at the time he had hurt the Serbian international: . 'Obviously I wouldn't have been happy if he had caught me there but as I say I've not meant it and I didn't know that I'd hurt him because it was just my momentum that took me that way. 'You're always going to get something like that in your life and I think that's one for me, but I like to think I deal with these things quite well.'

{"article":"Defending champions India sealed their place in the World Cup knockout stages with a nervy run chase against West Indies in Perth. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni helped to steer his team to a four-wicket victory in a low-scoring Pool B match. India, who bowled the Windies out for 182, therefore remain one of two unbeaten teams in the tournament - co-hosts New Zealand are the other - after scrambling the verdict with 10.5 overs to spare on a typically bouncy pitch at the WACA. Mahendra Singh Dhoni is congratulated by West Indies captain Chris Gayle after India's four-wicket win . The India captain hit an unbeaten knock of 45 as India chased down the target of 183 in the World Cup game . West Indies were hapless in the first 10 overs, after winning the toss on a glorious afternoon, and might have been bowled out even more cheaply but for four dropped catches by India and captain Jason Holder's second successive half-century from number nine. Dwayne Smith struggled badly against India's new-ball pair, eventually edging behind off Mohammad Shami (three for 35). Chris Gayle was out of sorts too, dropped twice and then holing out to a mis-pull off Shami - but not before a mix-up with Marlon Samuels saw the Windies number three run out for just two. Captain Denesh Ramdin could not halt the slide, aiming an expansive cover-drive to a swinging low full-toss first ball and instead edging on to Umesh Yadav. Lendl Simmons and Jonathan Carter almost doubled the score until the former fell pulling Mohit Sharma to deep backward-square. Darren Sammy was dropped by Ravindra Jadeja on five, when he mistimed a skier into the off-side ring off Mohit. India players celebrate after Mohamed Shami dismisses Darren Sammy of West Indies . Chris Gayle wasn't able to get into his stride on Friday, despite this unsuccessful appear from Shami . Andre Russell was soon gone instead, hitting Jadeja's first ball straight to long-off. But Sammy stayed long enough to help Holder (57) shepherd the Windies into powerplay, before he was caught-behind off the returning Shami. The captain struck four fours and three sixes from 64 balls but was last out, another hitting Jadeja to long-off, with almost six overs unused. Two wickets in an impressive new-ball spell from Jerome Taylor gave the Windies renewed hope, both openers going as Shikhar Dhawan was caught at second slip and Rohit Sharma edged an attempted drive behind. Virat Kohli threatened to shorten the chase until he hooked Russell into the hands of Samuels - and when Ajinkya Rahane went to a marginal DRS verdict, caught-behind off Kemar Roach, India had lost four wickets with more than 100 runs still needed. Suresh Raina struggled against the short ball before edging a cut behind off Smith's medium-pace, and the same tactic from Russell saw Jadeja pull Russell to a juggling Samuels. But Dhoni engineered an unbroken match-winning half-century stand with Ravi Ashwin and finished top-scorer with 45 not out in a curious contest which contained 47 extras.

{"article":"Batsman Joe Root feels England need to make a convincing statement that they belong in the World Cup quarter-finals when they meet Bangladesh and Afghanistan in their final two group games. England must win both matches, against lower-ranked opponents, to have any chance of reaching the knockout stage. An early exit looms large after Sunday's nine-wicket defeat to Sri Lanka in Wellington followed wide-margin beatings by co-hosts Australia and New Zealand. Joe Root has insisted that England must succeed in securing convincing victories in their next two games . Root snicks a ball down fine leg during England's defeat by Sri Lanka in their previous World Cup match . That has piled the pressure on, albeit in two games Root points out that England would have needed to win in any circumstance. 'If you play those two games at the start of the competition you still have to win them,' Root said. 'The way our schedule is, we have these games towards the end. If it was broken up a bit more it might look slightly different. 'But it doesn't take away from the fact that we want to win these two games convincingly.' England's hastened need to restore confidence is underlined by the fact that should they reach the last-eight they will now most likely play the highest-ranked team in Pool B. That will almost certainly be either South Africa or world champions India, who England did beat twice during the Tri-Series leading up to the World Cup. 'We don't want to just scrape through - we want to put in some really good performances and put to bed some of the things we've got wrong so far,' Root added. England captain Eoin Morgan was left with plenty to ponder after suffering his third defeat of the World Cup . Sangakkar and team-mate Thirimanne shake hands with Morgan after Sri Lanka's nine-wicket wi . 'We know that if we get through to the quarter-finals we'll be in a position where we have nothing to lose. 'There will be sides coming up against us who could potentially be quite timid and think they should beat us and that could work in our favour. 'By the time you get to that stage it's crunch time and every side is under pressure; not just us. Hopefully we can get those wins and build some momentum.' Root believes the gap between England and the best teams at the World Cup is not as large as their heavy defeats would suggest. 'I don't think that's fair,' he said. 'Yes, we have been beaten heavily in those three games, but I don't think that we are that far away from beating those sides. 'If we get the best out of every individual and all play as well as we can then we are just as good as sides like that if not better. It's about making sure, for the next two games especially, that we turn up and do everything we possibly can to put those performances in. 'That's got to come from the individuals to make sure they front up. Not just the senior players; not just exciting young players coming into the side. From everyone.' Root hit a career-best 121 from 108 balls against Sri Lanka but England's bowlers couldn't match his exploits . Steven Finn and James Taylor show their disappointment after England's third loss of the tournament . Root stood up to be counted in the Sri Lanka defeat when the 24-year-old became England's young World Cup centurion. His career-best 121 from 108 balls inspired England to a formidable 309 for six - the second successive match they had passed 300 - only for the bowlers to lack any penetration as twin tons from Lahiru Thirimanne and Kumar Sangakkara eased Sri Lanka to victory in 16 balls. 'At the start of the day, if you'd given us 310 we'd have thought that a very good effort,' Root said. 'Whenever you get 310 on the board you are immediately putting sides under pressure to chase it. Unfortunately we didn't create that pressure with the ball and we didn't do anything to make it difficult for them from 10 overs onwards.' The ease of Sri Lanka's chase suggested England did not set their sights high enough and, while Root admitted more risks can be taken with the bat, they had left Sri Lanka with a record chase at the ground. 'There was no feeling turning up to the game that 270 was a par score,' he said. 'We got out there, we played it as we saw it, there were periods when Sri Lanka bowled really well at us. We got 310 which, on that wicket, I felt was a good score. 'In one-day cricket maybe we could have taken a few more risks, potentially we could have gone a bit earlier at them, be more aggressive earlier. But it's a fine balance. If you then lose two wickets - on that wicket, we'd done well to get to where we were. 'Unfortunately we couldn't quite create the pressure with the ball that they did. We weren't disciplined enough and we leaked too many boundaries.'","highlights":"England have lost heavily to Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka .\nJoe Root says they have to impress against Bangladesh and Afghanistan .\nThey must beat both to have chance of reaching World Cup quarter-finals ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Jeremy Clarkson won't have his contract renewed as host of \"Top Gear\" after he apparently busted his producer's lip and verbally abused him, the BBC announced Wednesday. Clarkson, who hosted one of the most-watched television shows in the world, was suspended on March 10 after what the British broadcaster previously described as a \"fracas\" with producer Oisin Tymon on March 4. Wednesday, the BBC released the findings of an internal investigation into the incident. Ken MacQuarrie, who conducted the investigation, said Tymon had been \"subject to an unprovoked physical and verbal attack by Jeremy Clarkson\" at a hotel in North Yorkshire after a day of filming. \"During the physical attack Oisin Tymon was struck, resulting in swelling and bleeding to his lip,\" he said. The physical attack was halted after about 30 seconds by the intervention of a witness, MacQuarrie said, but Clarkson continued to use \"derogatory and abusive language\" for a sustained period of time. MacQuarrie said Clarkson made a number of attempts to apologize over subsequent days and had reported the incident to BBC management. BBC Director General Tony Hall issued a statement announcing Clarkson was being dropped. \"A member of staff -- who is a completely innocent party -- took himself to Accident and Emergency after a physical altercation accompanied by sustained and prolonged verbal abuse of an extreme nature. For me a line has been crossed,\" he said. \"I know how popular the program is and I also know that this decision will divide opinion.\" \"Top Gear,\" fronted by Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond, has made a name for itself globally with risky stunts and a brand of blokish humor that often toes the line and regularly steps over it. Clarkson is determinedly anti-politically correct on the topics he rails about, both on the show and in his newspaper and magazine columns. In his statement, Hall referenced the BBC's diversity, saying it was \"a broad church.\" \"We need distinctive and different voices but they cannot come at any price. Common to all at the BBC have to be standards of decency and respect,\" he said. North Yorkshire police issued a statement Wednesday saying they had asked for the BBC's report on the incident. \"The information will be assessed appropriately and action will be taken by North Yorkshire Police where necessary,\" they said. On March 10, the BBC announced that \"Top Gear's\" March 15 episode had been pulled and this week it canceled four live \"Top Gear\" shows scheduled for next week in Stavanger, Norway. However, it said the programs would be rescheduled and that all other live dates would \"run as scheduled.\" Hall said the BBC would \"look to renew 'Top Gear' for 2016\" and that he had asked BBC controller Kim Shillinglaw to \"look at how we put out the last programs in the current series.\" After his suspension by the BBC, Clarkson changed his Twitter profile to \"I am probably a presenter on the BBC2 motoring show,Top Gear.\" On Wednesday, the wording became past tense: \"I used to be a presenter on the BBC2 motoring show,Top Gear.\" Co-host Richard Hammond tweeted: \"Gutted at such a sad end to an era. We're all three of us idiots in our different ways but it's been an incredible ride together.\" Fans had earlier expressed outrage at the BBC decision to suspend Clarkson. Even media baron Rupert Murdoch commented on speculation that Clarkson would be sacked, posting a tweet Tuesday night in which he described the presenter as a \"funny man with great expertise.\" An online petition to have Clarkson reinstated has been signed by more than a million people. Fewer than 10,000 people signed a counterpetition calling for him to be fired. Last week, a fan dressed as the \"Stig\" -- the anonymous racing car test-driver who was once a regular feature of the show -- drove to the BBC's London headquarters in an armored tank to present the \"Bring Back Clarkson\" petition. Clarkson later thanked his supporters in a tweet shared more than 22,000 times. According to the BBC website, Clarkson is credited with changing the face of modern motoring journalism. It also adds: \"Terrifyingly, he might just be the most influential man in motoring.\" Clarkson has been at the helm of the program since 1998, and for more than a decade has fronted the relaunched version with Hammond and May. The trio's long-distance challenges in a mix of elite and sometimes barely roadworthy vehicles has earned the program cult status. In 2013, Guinness World Records named \"Top Gear\" the world's most widely watched factual program, with an estimated 350 million global viewers. The show is sold to 214 territories worldwide. Local versions have been made in the United States, China, Russia, Australia and South Korea. While Clarkson's abrasive style has proven popular with viewers, his on- and off-air comments have earned him a reputation as a politically incorrect maverick who often walks a fine line between humor and offense. Last year, he apologized profusely after being accused of mumbling the n-word in a clip that wasn't aired. \"I'd actually used the word I was trying to obscure. I was mortified by this, horrified. It is a word I loathe,\" Clarkson said in video statement posted online. He's been accused on other occasions of racism, including characterizing Mexicans as \"lazy and feckless\" and using the word \"slope\" over footage of an Asian man crossing a bridge during a \"Top Gear\" special in Myanmar. Producer Andy Wilman later apologized, calling it a \"light-hearted word play joke,\" and saying that the team was not aware that it was offensive to Asians. Last week, Clarkson launched into an expletive-filled rant at a charity auction in north London, verbally attacking his BBC bosses. A CNN reporter who was at the event said Clarkson swore often as he talked about his suspension from the show, saying the BBC had \"f**ked themselves\" and had ruined a great show. Clarkson later brushed off the incident, saying the rant was meant \"in jest\" and was designed to increase bids for the prize being auctioned -- one last lap of the \"Top Gear\" race track. CNN's Rosie Tomkins and journalist Monica Sarkar contributed to this report.","highlights":"North Yorkshire police ask for BBC report to assess it .\nBBC director general confirms Jeremy Clarkson sacked .\n\"Top Gear\" presenter was suspended after \"fracas\" with producer ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Samuel Eto'o wanted to buy a watch. It was in London that he decided to purchase one particular model, one which cost $15,000. For a former Premier League footballer, a hero in his native Cameroon, and one of the most successful African footballers of all time, the prospect of buying a watch was hardly the most daring of ordeals. So after taking a glance at the watch and getting out his credit card, he says he asked the sales assistant for some help. \"I asked the saleswoman -- who was also black like me -- 'Could you show me that watch please?' \"First, I saw her turn and look at her coworkers like, 'Uh, what should I do?' \"Eventually, she let me see the watch. I looked at it and said, 'OK, I'll buy it.' \"I took out my credit card and when she went to go run it through the machine, she came back and said that it was declined. \"I asked her, 'Was it declined or did you not want it to be accepted?' because this has happened to me many times and she told me, 'No, it was declined.'\" Eto'o, who played in London with Chelsea last season, called his brother who was nearby and it was he who brought a new credit card so the transaction could be completed. While Eto'o does speak English, his brother has a far wider vocabulary and was able to ask just what had occurred moments earlier. \"My brother can afford this and the way you're treating him shows that you think just because he's black, he can't afford this watch,\" said the sibling. Eto'o then takes up the story, saying the lady in the store said she was wary of him because \"we had some Nigerians in the store the other day who came with fake credit cards.\" \"If one of my own makes a mistake, they judge us all. Tomorrow, if a white man in Africa makes a mistake, we should judge all white people? No! \"The security guard from Senegal kept trying to justify what the lady said and I asked him where he's from. When he told me, I said, 'Ahh. If I gave you my name, you will recognize who I am?' \"He shrugged and I said, 'I'm Eto'o.' He went, 'Nooooo! Just yesterday, my wife and I were talking about you! Can I take a picture with you and send it to my wife?' \"I said, 'Yes, we can take a picture, but you made a mistake because you can't judge people by the color of their skin,' so he told me it wasn't because of our color. \"I told the lady, 'In my next interview, I'm going to tell them about this and I'll name the store so everyone can know that you treat people differently here,' added Eto'o referring to the saleswoman. \"She then realized that I could have reported what she had just done, but it was a mistake. It was a mistake of her to categorize. \"I don't think she's a racist person, but she stereotyped all black people as 'those people'.\" Eto'o tells this story to demonstrate his belief that racism is not just football's problem but one that society as a whole must combat. The Cameroon international has played across the world in England, Italy, Spain as well as a spell in Russia with Anzhi Makhachkala. He says he has experienced racism on and off the field, most famously during his time playing for Barcelona. In 2006, during a game against Real Zaragoza, Eto'o was subjected to \"monkey chants\" -- and the forward came close to walking off the pitch. He says it was only because of persuasion by his teammate Fran that he stayed on and helped his side to a 2-0 victory. In 2010, while playing for Inter Milan at Cagliari, Eto'o was again subjected to racist chanting which caused a three-minute stoppage to the contest. The referee addressed both captains while a message was also broadcast inside the stadium warning supporters the game would be abandoned if the chanting did not stop. Eto'o went on to score the only goal of the game as Inter triumphed 1-0. \"You have to understand that football is just a reflection of what we have in society,\" said Eto'o. \"It's not that football is here and society is here -- no, it's a reflection of what goes on in society. \"Football is a great opportunity for certain people, who sometimes think they're better than you or different than others, to express their views as right ... or as a chance to hurt other people. \"The first time I experienced racism wasn't on a football pitch, but the truth is that I never thought that that could happen to me on a football pitch because football is a passion, it's a feeling that touches millions of people. \"Sometimes, the fact that you're a footballer makes you think that racism can't happen to you because you bring that passion and you express a lot of things. \"When it happened to me, I couldn't believe it and in that moment, I decided to walk off the pitch.\" Eto'o, now 34, believes there has been progress within the game in recent years and has decided that it is safe enough for his children to return to stadiums. In 2007, he said he did not want his kids having to watch him being booed and subjected to racist abuse. \"I said that back then because racist incidents almost seemed to be fashionable,\" Eto'o explains. \"When you arrive at a football ground, this is going to happen -- when there's a black player, this will happen. \"In that moment, I said, 'No, my kids aren't going to go and see that because it will be very difficult to explain.' \"If you tell a child, go to the right and you'll get a reward, he'll always go to the right because he wants the reward. A child comes to see his father play, have fun, make people happy and what does he see? \"He sees people booing his father for being black, they make monkey noises, they throw bananas at his teammates and all that. \"But we see more and more that authorities are fighting, people are increasingly against what happens in football grounds and in society is getting better.\" Eto'o was presented with the European Medal of Tolerance from the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation following a ceremony in London earlier this week. For a man who has won three European Champions League titles, his assertion that this particular award is his \"biggest\" gives an insight into Eto'o's mindset in dealing with the scourge of racism. \"It's the most important,\" Eto'o said of the award. \"It's something that affects us all and to recognize the little work that I've done, the truth is that I'm very, very happy because you can win the Champions League, you can win championships, you can score goals, but to represent a fight that affects millions and millions of people ... it's one of a kind.\" Eto'o also defended Russia's record of dealing with racism, despite FIFA, the sport's world governing body, expressing its concerns over how the country's authorities deal with the problem. According to a report published earlier this month by the FARE network, an anti-racism body, and the Sova Center, which conducts research on nationalism and racism, there were more than 200 cases of discriminatory behavior within the Russian game over two seasons. The fans of CSKA Moscow, one of Russia's most famous clubs have been serial offenders in terms of racism with UEFA, the game's European governing body, handing out punishments on numerous occasions. Yet, Eto'o, now playing in Italy with Sampdoria, retains fond memories of Russia. The four-time African Player of the Year joined Anzhi in 2011 following a deal which made him the highest paid player in the world on a reported salary of $13 million a year. He scored 36 goals in 71 appearances before joining Chelsea in 2013 -- but he rejects any suggestions that Russia is a hotbed for racism ahead of the 2018 World Cup. \"At the World Cup in Russia, you'll see that there won't be incidents like this,\" he added. \"I hope there aren't because I've played there and I had a great time there and I know the efforts that the Russians are making to try to improve certain things that have happened there, and we have to support these efforts. \"Football is beautiful. Football is beautiful because whether you win, draw or lose, you can go and shake your opponent's hand whether they're white or black or red or blue. \"This is football. This is where football wins, but when there are incidents like this, it's shameful, but it doesn't mean this will happen in the World Cup just because it's in Russia. \"I was there and I lived a beautiful experience.\"","highlights":"Samuel Eto'o determined to rid football of racism .\nHe says award for fighting racism the \"biggest\" of his career .\nEto'o says he does not expect problems at 2018 World Cup in Russia ."}

{"article":"(CNN)It's a controversial question that's sparked debate since officials revealed the identity of the masked man known as Jihadi John. Was Mohammed Emwazi, the man with a British accent who's appeared in numerous ISIS beheading videos, pushed toward extremism by authorities? Or was he someone who'd long been heading down a militant path? A London-based advocacy group that worked with Emwazi says emails he sent them paint a picture of a desperate man hounded by authorities who saw his plans for a new life crumble as he tried unsuccessfully to get help. And a report from the Daily Mail, also citing emails purportedly sent from Emwazi to the British publication, said the Kuwait-born Londoner saw himself as a \"dead man walking\" and contemplated suicide because of his alleged harassment by authorities. But some analysts say the emails are only part of the story, arguing that investigators targeted Emwazi because they already saw he had links with terrorist groups. \"You can't start the story at how he's been treated by UK officials. You certainly can't start the story from the email trail,\" said Rashad Ali, director at the counterextremism consultancy CENTRI and a fellow of the Institute of Strategic Dialogue. \"You have to go back to why the intelligence services got in contact with him. Well, because he was part of a group of a people who were going to join Al-Shabaab -- a very extremist organization and jihadist group that got involved in horrific terrorist attacks in Somalia.\" Emwazi felt he was being harassed by authorities and tried to seek legal help to stop it, according to CAGE, the human rights and Muslim advocacy organization that worked with him. One email details Emwazi's account of his detention at a British airport, when authorities stopped him from traveling to Kuwait in 2010 and questioned him for hours. \"I told them that I want to be left alone, as I have an ambition of moving from the UK and settling in Kuwait. That is why I found a job and a spouse!! But they laughed,\" Emwazi wrote in a message dated June 3, 2010. \"One of them got aggressive with me, he pushed me to the wall. ... I was just baffled I did not know why he had done that after this long 6hour interview, fingerprinting and searching. When I asked for their names they said 'We don't give out our names.' \" Emwazi wrote that the way he was treated by British security and intelligence officials reminded him \"of criminals that you see on TV who have committed a serious crime, only I was a person never charged or arrested for anything. I was a person looking to start a new life in my country Kuwait!\" That's a key detail, CAGE spokesman Amandla Thomas-Johnson said. \"If someone is going to carry out some violent attack in any kind of way, then the law is there to be in force and apprehend them,\" he said. \"In the UK, he wasn't arrested once, prosecuted or cautioned whatsoever.\" British authorities have not responded to CNN's requests for comment on the case. In the emails, Emwazi pleaded for CAGE's help. \"Please help me as I don't want to stay in the UK because I have found a Job in Kuwait, found a spouse in Kuwait and thus found a new start for my life in Kuwait. Kuwait is where I'm from, I was born their. I just want to go their and start my new life again!!\" Emwazi wrote that he had also made a formal complaint at the Independent Police Complaints Commission, before going into detail about how he was apparently \"assaulted by the police officer\" as he attempted to leave for Kuwait. But it was a difficult complaint to prove, Thomas-Johnson said. \"The IPCC says there's no camera in the room where this took place, so we can't really do much about it except put a black mark against the officer,\" he said.  \"These things happen in the shadows and the dark. So it is very difficult to independently verify once it's taken place. There isn't much of an opportunity to gain redress and accountability.\" Details from court papers reported in British media paint a different picture. They say Emwazi was part of a group of extremists sometimes called the \"North London Boys\" who allegedly funneled money and recruits to Al-Shabaab. The Guardian has reported that Emwazi was part of a terror cell with links to the failed London bomb attacks in 2005. To British authorities, his face was a familiar one for more than five years. But authorities lost track of him in 2013, according to friends. He changed his name and made his way to Syria. Analysts who've studied ISIS recruiting say they aren't buying the argument that harassment from authorities turned Emwazi into \"Jihadi John.\" \"I think it's an absurd claim,\" said Peter Neumann, director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation. \"It was not the cause of his radicalization. The reason the intelligence services harassed him was because they suspected him of trying to join the Shabaab in Somalia.\" Ali argued that abuse at the hands of officials is not an excuse for terrorism. \"People do not turn around, when harassed and have grievances, and become terrorists,\" he said. In addition to the emails released by CAGE, another series of emails from Emwazi came to light over the weekend. The messages were sent in 2010 and 2011 to the Daily Mail's security editor, Robert Verkaik. The Daily Mail published excerpts from those exchanges, including Emwazi's description of an incident where he tried to sell his laptop through a website, but only stated his surname. When he met a potential buyer at a London underground station, he says the person he met shook his hand and said \"nice doing business with you Mohammed.\" \"I NEVER TOLD THIS PERSON MY FIRST NAME!!\" wrote Emwazi to Verkaik. \"& I NEVER GIVE OUT MY FIRST NAME!! IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO KNOW MY FIRST NAME!!\" He also hinted at suicidal thoughts. \"Sometimes i feel like im a dead man walking, not fearing they may kill me. \"Rather, fearing that one day, I'll take as many pills as I can so that I can sleep for ever!! I just want to get away from these people!!!\" Verkaik said he met Emwazi in 2010 when he was investigating his claims of being harassed by police and intelligence. Emwazi's concerns bordered on paranoia, Verkaik wrote, and he desperately wanted his story to be told. \"Like many young Muslim men at the time, he appeared to have a grievance. But this man was different,\" Verkaik wrote. \"In him was a warped sense of injustice that could never justify the barbaric acts of murder that he has gone on to carry out in Syria.\" CNN's Brian Todd and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.","highlights":"Advocacy group CAGE releases emails between \"Jihadi John\" and the organization's research director .\nMohammed Emwazi complained about his treatment by British airport security officials and police .\nRashad Ali, director at counterextremism consultancy, argues that the emails don't give the full picture ."}
{"article":"Rangers Supporters Trust spokesman Chris Graham praised fans for the part they have played in forcing change at Ibrox before warning them: 'The hard work starts now.' The RST and Rangers First, another group aimed at fan ownership, had amassed almost 19,000 registered members between them going into Friday's EGM. A combination of shares purchased by each organisation, using cash raised from that backing and from proxies, saw them hold around 10 per cent of the voting power at the meeting. Rangers fans gather outside Ibrox stadium to hear news from the extraordinary general meeting . Rangers Supporters Trust Spokesman Chris Graham has praised fans' role in changing the club . Dave King (centre) received almost 86 per cent of the votes from Rangers shareholders for power at Ibrox . Fans show their delight for the incoming Rangers board of King, John Gilligan (left) and Paul Murray (right) Graham is delighted the club's followers have performed such a significant role in getting Dave King, Paul Murray and John Gilligan on to the board and overthrowing previous incumbents Derek Llambias and Barry Leach but insisted there is still much more to do. Now he has urged supporters to keep investing in the two fan movements to ensure there is never a repeat of the financial turmoil experienced at Rangers in recent years. 'The response to both schemes has been amazing and it has been crucial, not just in winning the EGM but also in moving forward,' he said. 'It is important the fans want to have more of a shareholding in the club. I believe we can trust this board and I think they will run the club properly. 'We don't know what is going to happen in 10 years' time, though, so it's vital the fans have a big enough say to stop anything like we've seen in the last three or four years from happening again. Now they have that. And if there is a new share issue I think it's important they continue to up their shareholding to a more significant portion. 'It has been brilliant seeing how people have risen to the challenge. The Trust has been plugging away at this for 12 years while Rangers First is a more recent thing. But, to be honest, it's just great to see the fans getting behind the same objective, however they have chosen to do that. 'What the supporters have done has been crucial in winning the vote and it will be crucial going forward. Now it's really important we get working as soon as possible. There will obviously be a couple of days of celebration but there's going to be a huge rebuilding process at the club. 'It has been ripped apart over the last few years so the priority is to get the hard work started straight away. Some things can be done quickly and others will take a bit longer . 'I can understand where Kenny McDowall was coming from when he said it is going to take five years to fix the club. I think he was talking there about the football infrastructure and things such as scouting and youth development take a long time to come through if you start doing them properly. A Rangers fan  holds up a sign in protest against Mike Ashley, Derek Llambias and Barry Leach . Just\u00a015 per cent of the club's shareholders voted to keep Llambias (pictured, centre) and Leach at Ibrox . 'But Dave King was right, too, in the sense that there are things you can do in the short-term which would immediately improve the situation. Even just getting the fans back in the stadium is an improvement because there's increased revenue from that alone. On the football side, appointing a new manager will be an improvement and we'll possibly be able to bring in players in the summer who can improve the squad. 'What matters most is there are guys in the boardroom now who actually care about the club. They aren't just there to feather their own nests and that's the difference.' Although Llambias and Leach are no longer on the board, they do remain employed by the club as chief executive and financial director respectively. Severance deals must be struck and, although both men have dug their heels in this week, Graham thinks it's only a matter of time until they are driven out of the club. 'Leach and Llambias can make it a little bit difficult in terms of getting them to leave and I'm sure they will make it as hard as they can,' he said. 'They are obviously in this for themselves so they will try to get what they can out of the situation. 'The Sports Direct contract is obviously something which still needs to be looked at and there are big question marks over how a lot of contracts came to be latterly. That will need to be examined pretty closely but I don't think there is anything that's insurmountable as long as the people in the boardroom want to get it fixed. That's the big difference. There's nothing the club can't do as long as everybody is pulling in the one direction.' Tackling the influence of Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley (pictured) will be next on the Rangers fans' agenda .","highlights":"Fan ownership groups\u00a0amassed\u00a0nearly 19,000 members before Friday's EGM .\nOver 85 per cent of Gers shareholders backed Dave King's plans for Rangers .\nSupporters helped to oust Derek Llambias and Barry Leach from the board .\nChris Graham has praised the Rangers Supporters Trust and Rangers First .\nHowever, he has warned there is still plenty of work to be done at the club .\nFocus will be turned to the Sports Direct contract and Mike Ashley ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Eastern Europe, here comes the cavalry. The U.S. Army says it will soon be sending armored Stryker vehicles on a 1,100-mile convoy through six European countries to show solidarity to allies in the wake of recent Russian actions in the Ukraine and Crimea that have Eastern Europe on edge. The move was first reported Thursday in the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. U.S. Army Europe posted the Stripes story on its website on Friday. The convoy is \"a highly visible demonstration of U.S, commitment to its NATO allies and demonstrating NATO's ability to move military forces freely across allied borders in close cooperation,\" U.S. Army Europe spokesman Lt. Col. Craig Childs, said in a statement, according to the Stripes report. The troops and vehicles involved will be moving from training exercises conducted as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve in Estonia, Lithuania and Poland, the report said. They'll move through Latvia and the Czech Republic as they make their way to Vilseck, Germany, about a 40 miles drive from the Czech border. The troops involved are from the 3rd Squadron, 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which are based at Rose Barracks in Vilseck, and they will be accompanied by the Army's 12th Combat Aviation Brigade, which will provide aerial reconnaissance, the Stripes report said. The move is unusual because long-distance movement of heavy military vehicles such as the 18-ton Strykers is usually done by rail. The trek is being called a \"Dragoon Ride,\" after the unit's nickname, the Dragoons. Troops will camp out along the route. \"For those participating in it, Dragoon Ride is a unique opportunity,\" Stripes quoted Childs as saying. \"Soldiers and their leaders will have numerous opportunities to engage with local communities along the route, deepen their appreciation for the cultural diversity within the alliance and enhance the relationships that are essential to building and maintaining mutual admiration, respect and trust among allied militaries.\" The convoy will be the latest in a series of displays the U.S. and its NATO allies have taken under Operation Atlantic Resolve, during which the U.S. \"is demonstrating its continued commitment to collective security through a series of actions designed to reassure NATO allies and partners of America's dedication to enduring peace and stability in the region, in light of the Russian intervention in Ukraine,\" according to the Defense Department's website. The displays have come as close to 300 yards from the Russian border as U.S. Army Strykers participated in an independence day celebration in Nava, Estonia, last month. Other recent actions include the Air Force's movement of 12 A-10 Thunderbolt \"tankbuster\" attack jets to an air base in Germany and this month the placing of hundreds of tanks and military vehicles in Latvia, where they'll soon be matched up with 3,000 troops from Fort Stewart, Georgia. Tension with Russia extends to the air too. Adm. William Gortney, commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday that \"this past year has marked a notable increase in Russian military assertiveness.\" Russian heavy bomber aircraft flew more patrols outside Russian airspace \"than in any year since the Cold War,\" though he did not offer a specific number. There have also been increased Russian air patrols across the coastlines of Europe.","highlights":"Armored U.S. Army Strykers to make trek to display solidarity with U.S. allies .\n16-ton armored vehicles usually moved long distances by rail .\nMove is latest NATO military display after Russian actions in Ukraine, Crimea ."}
{"article":"(CNN)The photographs released by ISIS in its stronghold of Raqqa are dated March 2015.  The first ones show a large crowd, mostly men, but also among them a handful of women and children, all looking up. Three men on top of a building, faces covered in black balaclavas, stand on either side of their victim, while a fourth seems to be taking a photo or video. Their victim is thrown off the building. In the last photograph, he is seen face down, surrounded by a small crowd of men, most carrying weapons, some with rocks in their hands. The caption reads \"stoned to death.\" The victim brutally killed because he was accused of being gay. There are at least half a dozen documented cases of men being similarly killed by ISIS. What's even more sickening for Nour, a gay Syrian man, is the onlookers' reaction. \"It's too much to watch, and people are just standing there in these images and watching, and they are not doing anything, and their facial expressions are really scary because they are not even scared of what is going on,\" says Nour, who's also an LGBT rights activist. \"They might be a little bit excited or maybe happy to get rid of homosexuals in the city.\" Though in Istanbul, fear of persecution continues to haunt Nour, who asked us to conceal his identity as he waits and hopes for asylum in America and continues to campaign for rights for people who are LGBT -- lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans. As a teenager, over a decade ago, Nour suffered because of his sexuality. \"The worst bullying was at school,\" he remembers. \"I was approached in the street a number of times, verbally abused and sometimes physically abused.\" There was no one to protect him. His family rejected his sexual orientation, his country criminalized it. Article 520 of the Syrian Penal Code of 1949 states: \"Any unnatural sexual intercourse shall be punished with a term of imprisonment of up to three years.\" Nour left Syria in 2012, before ISIS took over huge swaths of the country, after seeing a video of two men being beheaded. According to the voice on the clip, they are accused of being spies.  Then toward the end, the voice speaks about \"shaking the throne of God.\" \"Whenever we hear this in video or audio, we know that this is exactly meant for gay people,\" he says. \"It was the moment of clarity, the moment of understanding; this place is not safe anymore.\" The pictures released by ISIS and other videos refer to gay men as the tribe of Lot, who, according to readings of the Quran and the hadith, or prophetic traditions, sinned by refusing Prophet Lot's call to cease their homosexual activity and led to the destruction of Sodom. One hadith states, \"When a man mounts another man, the throne of God shakes.\" Since the revolution turned war in Syria, the situation for the nation's LGBT community has become even more dire. \"LGBT people in Syria need help, and they need to be supported. We tried to reach out to some groups, international entities, and they said that LGBT people in Syria are not our priority, and that would mean that our lives are not worthy for them to rescue,\" Nour says. This week, the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, a nongovernmental organization based in New York, started \"Don't Turn Away,\" an awareness-raising campaign calling for action to protect LGBT Syrians and Iraqis from ISIS' merciless brutality. On its website, the group states, \"What is clear is the Islamic State's intent -- to spread terror among an already persecuted population in the region and to warn against any kind of 'moral' transgression.\" The commission is calling on governments and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to expedite resettlement and refugee applications for LGBTs. Sami and his partner are among those waiting. Dressed in matching outfits, they already consider themselves married, laughing about how they first met online. They too, like Nour, don't want their identities revealed. When Sami's family found out about his relationship, he says, his brother tried to beat him up. He started to receive threatening phone calls from family and strangers. This past summer, while the couple was walking in the streets in Damascus, a car tried to run them over. \"I was able to pull myself away, but my husband couldn't,\" Sami recalls. \"The car hit his leg and he fell to the ground.\" There is no doubt that it was a deliberate attempt to kill them. Two hours after the attack, Sami's phone rang. \"There was a man who said this time you could have made it, you could have survived, but the next time you will not.\" The couple fled to Turkey a few months ago, but they can't shake the fear that their relationship could cost them their lives. They share housing with other Syrian refugees, where they have to continue to pretend that they are straight. When the ISIS photographs emerged, one of their housemates made a sickening comment. \"He made an absurd joke about how he was so amused, had too much fun watching homosexuals. He says now gay men can fly.\" They say they will never return to Syria. And neither will Nour. \"It's too damaging for my psychological state, because I have been abused too much from my family, friends, school.  It's not safe for me psychologically or physically,\" he says. Opinion: ISIS's warped take on morality .","highlights":"\"LGBT people in Syria need help, and they need to be supported,\" says Nour, a Syrian gay rights activist now living in Turkey .\n\"We tried to reach out to some groups, international entities, and they said that LGBT people in Syria are not our priority,\" he says .\nThe International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission is calling for action to protect LGBT Syrians and Iraqis from ISIS ."}

{"article":"(CNN)It shouldn't come as a surprise that Yemen has collapsed -- again.  A country that has split and been pulled together before, has the youngest and fastest growing population in the region, is running low on oil and water, and possesses a \"personalist\" government rather than stable institutions, was on the top of every expert's list as the fragile state most likely to fail next. What is surprising is that U.S. policy ignored all of this and proceeded on the premise that simply drone-bombing al Qaeda terrorists could keep Yemen intact and stable. Indeed, last fall, when President Barack Obama pointed to U.S. policy in Yemen as an example of a \"success\" and a model for the plans that would roll back the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), I shivered. For as September ended, Shi'ite Houthi rebels from the north moved south and took the capital city, Sanaa. By January, the Islamic State was noticeably increasing its recruitment in Yemen, and that same month the Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for organizing the deadly Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris. Last week, the Islamic State bombed two Shi'ite mosques in Yemen, killing more than 130 worshippers at prayer.  This week, the Houthi forces are closing in on Yemen's second major city,  Aden, on the south coast, and the U.S.-supported President, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, has reportedly fled the country. As the United States has closed its embassy and withdrawn its last troops, Yemen has slid into total chaos, with rebels and jihadists on both sides capturing military bases and seizing tanks and heavy weapons. The situation is so dire that a coalition of Sunni nations, led by Saudi Arabia, has launched massive airstrikes against the Houthis, with a Saudi adviser threatening to bring up to 150,000 ground troops into Yemen to restore the Hadi regime. Yemen does have value as a lesson -- this is what happens when you ignore the basic foundations of social stability. These include legitimate leadership with stable succession plans; a united elite; institutions to bridge regional and ethnic divisions and assure fairness in political and economic access and a functioning economy with capabilities for providing employment and growth. Rather than working to secure these things, the U.S. administration has succumbed to the illusion that precision bombing or other surgical interventions to remove \"dangerous elements\" will sustain broader social and political stability. Anyone could see that the conditions for collapse were progressing in Yemen and that aerial attacks on al Qaeda terrorists would have no effect on them. Those attacks were a sideshow -- like firing a lousy band performing on the deck of an ocean liner, while a hull full of holes is taking on water fast. What we have now is an area with about 24 million people, more than twice the population now under the rule of the Islamic State in eastern Syria and western Iraq, that is virtually ungoverned and up for grabs and is falling into the grips of an all-out civil war between Iran-supported Shi'as and al Qaeda\/ISIS-aligned Sunnis. It is a war that the West loses no matter who wins. It is now too late to do much of anything except watch and try to either support any moderate elements if they should emerge as capable of holding regional or national power, or contain any dangerous jihadist elements if they should do so. Either task will be difficult, and provide yet another costly distraction to efforts to restore peace in Syria and Iraq. In other words, what has happened in Yemen, although predictable, is about the worst outcome imaginable for U.S. policy.  That America ever deluded itself into thinking airstrikes were enough to deal with the problems of failing states in the Middle East and North Africa -- and the crisis of ISIS -- is a notion that could only be made more frightening if it keeps on doing it.","highlights":"Goldstone: U.S. policy of drone-bombing al Qaeda terrorists ignores need to build social stability .\nHe says country now in chaos, virtually ungoverned and vulnerable to jihadist elements ."}
{"article":"(CNN)A Russian property developer, a Chinese outfit operating shell companies and Venezuelan officials ripping off the state-owned oil companies -- all of them are accused of coming to a bank in the European principality of Andorra to \"wash\" their money. Now the U.S. Treasury is casting a spotlight on the alleged misdeeds of senior managers at the Banca Privada d'Andorra (BPA), several of whom have been arrested in the past few days. The Treasury Department has alleged that \"high-level managers [at BPA] accepted payments and other benefits from their criminal clients.\" The Andorran authorities took over the running of the bank after the Treasury revelations, and the director general of the Banca Privada, Joan Pau Miquel Prats, was arrested late Friday. Two more bank officials were arrested Sunday. Tiny Andorra, nestled in the rugged Pyrenees mountains, has two big neighbors. One is France. And the scandal has spread to its other neighbor, Spain, where corruption among public officials is a hot-button political issue. Prats had driven BPA's expansion into Spain, through its acquisition of Banco Madrid, in 2011. Banco Madrid caters to wealthy private clients and came under investigation by Spanish financial authorities last year. Since the BPA scandal broke, the commission that investigates illicit financial activity, Sepblac, has raised questions about accounts held by influential Spanish political and business figures at the Banco Madrid. They have not been named. The Central Bank has taken control of Banco Madrid and sent in two inspectors to examine accounts there. The bank's board, which included Prats and a former high-ranking official of the Central Bank, resigned on Thursday. Spanish officials say some 20 suspect operations at the bank are being examined. Spanish authorities are separately investigating substantial assets held at the Banca Privada d'Andorra by members of the Pujol family, who have long been prominent in the politics of Catalonia, a region of Spain that includes Barcelona. The director of the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Jennifer Shasky Calvery, said that \"BPA's corrupt high-level managers and weak antimoney laundering controls have made BPA an easy vehicle for third-party money launderers to funnel proceeds of organized crime, corruption and human trafficking through the U.S. financial system.\" BPA has correspondent accounts with four banks -- HSBC, Citigroup, Bank of America and Deutsche Bank -- through which hundreds of millions of dollars passed. Senior managers at BPA tailored services to their clients to disguise the origin of funds, the Treasury said. One manager provided \"substantial assistance\" to a Russian client, Andrei Petrov, described by the Treasury as a \"third-party money launderer working for Russian criminal organizations.\" Petrov had also received a line of credit from Banco Madrid and is alleged to have bribed local officials in the resort where he set up a property development company. He was arrested in Spain two years ago and is accused of helping launder some 56 million euros ($59 million) in proceeds from Russian criminal organizations. Petrov is yet to go on trial. According to the U.S. Treasury, Petrov has links with one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives, Simeon Mogilevich. BPA is also alleged to have helped Venezuelan money launderers siphon funds from the state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela. \"This money-laundering network worked closely with high-ranking government officials in Venezuela, resident agents in Panama, and an Andorran lawyer to establish Panamanian shell companies,\" the Treasury said. BPA processed about $2 billion in transactions by shell companies related to the scheme. Treasury said another senior official at BPA accepted bribes in return for processing bulk cash transfers for a Chinese money launderer, Gao Ping, who was arrested in Spain in September 2012. \"Through his associate, Ping bribed Andorran bank officials to accept cash deposits into less scrutinized accounts and transfer the funds to suspected shell companies in China,\" it said in a statement. Credit rating agency Standard & Poor's has reacted to the growing scandal by downgrading Andorra's rating. Andorra is highly dependent on its banking sector, which makes up some 20% of its GDP. Spain has long battled the presence of Russian organized crime on its soil. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, wealthy Russians came to Spain for its climate and what were then lax financial controls. Among them were more than a few \"vory v zakone,\" the top echelon of Russian organized crime, according to Spanish officials. Spanish prosecutor Jose Grinda Gonzalez told U.S. officials five years ago that these individuals had no known jobs and unknown sources of income, yet they lived in large mansions. Grinda's remarks were reported in a diplomatic cable later published by WikiLeaks. Grinda had prosecuted Zakhar Kalashov, a Georgian-born, Russian citizen widely regarded as one of the most powerful figures in the Russian mafia. Last year, before he completed his nine-year sentence, a Spanish appeals court deported Kalashov to Russia, where he is now a free man. Another Spanish prosecutor, Fernando Bermejo, told US officials in 2009 that there was large scale money-laundering going on in Catalonia and \"many, many\" members of the Russian mafia were active there. Because of growing international cooperation, Spanish prosecutors have stepped up their pursuit of alleged gang leaders, money launderers and embezzlers from Eastern Europe. Among the latest to be detained is a former finance minister from Ukraine, Yuriy Kolobov. He was detained at a luxury development in Alicante earlier this month, after prosecutors in Kiev charged him with embezzlement and is awaiting extradition. Kolobov was a minister in the government of President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled Ukraine during street protests a year ago.

{"article":"Selma, Alabama (CNN)Crowds massed at a bridge in Selma, Alabama, Sunday to remember and reflect upon the sacrifices of another crowd that gathered at the same bridge half a century ago on a day that came to be known as \"Bloody Sunday.\" Walkers marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in the afternoon to commemorate those freedom-marchers who were clubbed and tear-gassed by state troopers as they peacefully filed across on March 7, 1965. The crowd was massive. It was shoulder to shoulder near the bridge and several blocks away. There were so many people that walking is a bit misleading -- people just really moved inch by inch along the way. The protest decades ago against the denial of civil rights to Americans based solely on the color of their skin, and the television coverage of the bludgeoning dealt them, hastened the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. On Sunday at Selma's Brown Chapel AME, a historically black church, leaders in the religious and political realm as well as community organizers gathered to hear speeches, sing hymns and remember what happened 50 years ago. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder was in the audience. Rev. Jesse Jackson spoke, as did Rev. Al Sharpton. An important figure in the decades-long fight for civil rights, former Atlanta Mayor and U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young remembered the struggle in the 1960s but wanted everyone to keep pushing forward and thinking about achieving economic equality today. \"We've got to focus on ourselves not as problems but as visionaries,\" he said. \"We have come a long, long way, but I have enjoyed every bit of it,\" Young remarked. Several people remarked at how much it meant that the day before, on Saturday, America's first African-American President, Barack Obama, made a rousing speech on racial progress in a diverse country. He said that the struggle against discrimination continues today. Looking back, the \"Bloody Sunday\" march was triggered when a law officer shot a black man dead the month before. But it was about more -- the right to vote for all Americans. About 600 people were going to march 50 miles to the state capital in Montgomery before they were forcibly stopped. Sunday's festivities started with a breakfast and end late with a dance. A string of parades, receptions, reflections, films and discussions will fill the time in between. The  commemoration marking 50 years since \"Bloody Sunday\" continues on Monday. \"Our march is not yet finished. But we are getting closer,\" Obama said Saturday, his words echoing into a crowd of thousands lined up in front of him. Obama emphasized that a day of commemoration is not enough to repay the debt paid by the marchers who were beaten 50 years ago as they demonstrated for voting rights. \"If Selma taught us anything, it's that our work is never done,\" the President said near Edmund Pettus Bridge. Read President Obama's prepared remarks . The President said that what civil rights marchers did years ago \"will reverberate through the ages. Not because the change they won was preordained; not because their victory was complete; but because they proved that nonviolent change is possible; that love and hope can conquer hate.\" He hailed the marchers as heroes. The President said that \"the Americans who crossed this bridge, they were not physically imposing, but they gave courage to millions. They held no elected office. But they led a nation.\" The President called on Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act, first passed in 1965. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a key provision of the law that required certain states with a history of racial discrimination at the polls to \"pre-clear\" any changes to the law with the federal government before implementing them. Efforts to revive key provisions of the act have stalled in Congress. 50 years later: Memories from 'Bloody Sunday' nurse . Many of the nation's leaders, activists and celebrities were in Selma on Saturday attending various activities taking place in memory of the historic event. On Saturday, Rep. John Lewis -- one of the demonstrators bloodied by troopers 50 years ago -- and nearly 100 other members of Congress from both parties joined the President at the bridge in Selma -- a bridge that still bears the name of Pettus, a Confederate general who was also a Ku Klux Klan leader. \"We must use this moment to recommit ourselves to do all we can to finish this work. There's still work to be done,\" said Lewis, adding this is an opportunity to \"redeem the soul of America.\" John Lewis's memories of the march . Reflecting a sense of change in the half century since \"Bloody Sunday,\" and with Selma again in a national media spotlight, the mood in the crowd Saturday was of unity, and talks were focused on how to move America forward. But some current Selma residents worried that after the dignitaries leave their town -- with a population 82% black and with more than 40% of its people living below the national poverty level -- will fade from view except for its historical significance. Geraldine Martin, 59, has lived in Selma all her life. She was 9 years old on \"Bloody Sunday\" and with her mother had just welcomed a little sister, Belinda, to the world on that day. The two sisters grew up in Selma less than a decade apart. Opinion: Selma's historic bridge deserves a better name . Belinda left Selma after high school and now lives in Atlanta. Her view of Selma has changed over the years -- looking in from the outside. \"I don't see how Selma will move forward without togetherness,\" said Belinda. \"There is no diversity in Selma. People don't live together.\" CNN's Moni Basu reported from Selma. CNN's Slma Shelbayah wrote and reported from Atlanta. CNN's Steve Almasy and Douglas Brinkley contributed to this report.","highlights":"A large crowd walks the footsteps of those who marched 50 years ago .\nThey are crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge, named for a former KKK leader .\nPresident Obama called Saturday for renewal of Voting Rights Act ."}
{"article":"France is filled with foreboding about the fate that awaits Philippe Saint-Andre's misfiring team at Twickenham. The coach has come in for fierce criticism during another RBS Six Nations campaign of grinding, mid-table mediocrity, but according to two members of the last Gallic team to win a championship match in London, exactly a decade ago, the problems run deeper than the man in charge. Their primary concerns are the mass influx of overseas players into the Top 14 league which has stalled the development of home-grown talent \u2013 and the death of French flair.

There is still a mathematical chance that Les Bleus can win the title this weekend, but that is pie in the sky and cannot disguise their chronic limitations. Dimitri Yachvili, the goal-kicking hero of France's 18-17 win at the home of their fiercest rivals in 2005, describes it as a 'bad time for our rugby' and suggests that the booming import trade is the primary issue. 'To me, the problem is that we have too many foreign players in the Top 14 and all the good young French players don't play enough,' said the former Biarritz scrum-half. 'The clubs prefer buying a South African player, or a Kiwi player or an Australian player \u2013 maybe because they think it is safer to do that. The young players don't play and that is not good. 'When young players arrive in the French team, they don't have enough experience of the high level. A few years ago, you had to be good for one or two years for your club, before you could be picked for France. Now you just have to do one good move in a match. Former France scrum half Dimitri Yachvili fires out a pass during his side's clash against England in 2004 . Yachvili's sublime goal-kicking performance secured France's last victory at Twickenham back in 2005 . 'Against Wales at Stade de France and against Ireland in Dublin, we were not very far from winning those games, but we are missing the experience that is needed. If we didn't have so many foreign players in our league, the players would have more experience and we could win those games.' Serge Betsen was another stalwart of the France team that stormed the Twickenham barricades 10 years ago. The ex-Biarritz and Wasps flanker is also worried about the lack of player development in his country, adding: 'The politicians need to help the youngsters to get experience at the highest level. English rugby organises things to give their national players priority. 'During my time at Biarritz, I played with Joe Roff, who won the World Cup with Australia. These kind of players showed me how to improve. To be in contact with them is important, but you still need to give opportunities to the youngsters. We've got a lot of talented players like Gael Fickou and Wesley Fofana. But Fickou needs the time to express his talent. I don't know why he hasn't had the time.' Former France flanker Serge Betsen (right) is worried by the amount of overseas players in the Top 14 . Noa Nakaitaci . Once captain of the Fiji schoolboys team, the powerful winger moved to France after Clermont Auvergne set up an academy in the Pacific Islands. He signed with the Top 14 club in 2011 and made his France debut two years later. Rory Kockott . The scrum-half was snapped up by Les Bleus as soon as he became eligible for selection through the three-year residency rule. He was tipped as a Springboks star following his time with the Natal Sharks but was overlooked by South Africa coach Heyneke Meyer. Bernard Le Roux . Despite being born and raised in Moorreesburg, South Africa, the flanker made his rugby debut in Amsterdam. He joined the Border Bulldogs on the Eastern Cape and was offered a deal with the Lions but opted for a move to Racing Metro. Scott Spedding . Born in Krugersdorp, South Africa, the full back came through the Natal Sharks academy and represented the Springboks at Under 21 level. He signed for Brive in 2008 before moving to Bayonne and was granted a French passport last year. The decline of the renowned French flair has been in evidence at Test and club level for several years now. A nation once known for cavalier attacking play which conjured such iconic moments as the fabled 'Try from the end of the earth' in Auckland in 1994 has largely adopted a more pragmatic, Anglo-Saxon reliance on brute force. Asked if his country have tried too hard to play like England, Yachvili said: 'Yes, yes. We have lost our French rugby a little bit, because a lot of foreign players have come to play for the French clubs and they have another culture and another way of playing. We must try to keep the French flair, but I think we have lost that a bit. 'It is in our DNA to play intuitive rugby. We don't have the best organisation and the best game-plans in the world, but what we have more than other nations is this way to attack from everywhere. But we must be open-minded and free to play this rugby, and at the moment I think we're not free.' Betsen echoed his former team-mate, adding: 'England has taken parts of the French to add that X-factor to their game \u2013 guys like George Ford \u2013 who aren't just about kicking but can spot the gap. 'French rugby tried to follow other nations and copy their way of doing things, but it's not always been effective. We want players to practise weights more than passing, but we need a more holistic approach. The flair comes with confidence and trust. You need panache, enjoyment and excitement; sometimes that's been missing.' What has not been lost along the way is a fervent passion for this classic fixture. The cross-Channel rivalry stirs French blood as much as it ever did. An admiration for those who wear the Red Rose is temporarily shelved at kick-off time. 'We like English rugby, but we hate them just for 80 minutes!' said Yachvili, who spent a season at Gloucester. 'They are very good players, they are very well organised, they have a very good game-plan and we respect them, but for 80 minutes it will always be a very big battle. Betsen believes players such as Gael Fickou (left) and Wesley Fofana are hindered by the current system . 'Of course, it is the biggest game for us. It is historic and it is always special. It is Le Crunch. It is the last game this year and England can still win the Six Nations. For us, we will be more scared before the game than last week or against Wales at home, but I'm hoping we can do something special.' That is certainly what Yachvili did in 2005. It was his special goal-kicking that helped France rally from a 17-6 half-time deficit to win 18-17. As it turns out, he was assisted with his match-winning efforts by an Englishman, whose identity remains a secret. 'It was crazy because, in the captain's run training session the day before the game, my kicking was very bad and my coach was very scared about the game,' he said. 'But in the game, I think one kick hit the post but the rest were good. Giant New Zealand-born prop\u00a0Uini Atonio (right) is another foreign player that is part of the France squad . 'I broke my kicking tee in the captain's run training session and I had to ask a friend living in London where I could buy a tee, because I wanted the same one. He said the only shop around was at Twickenham, so he went to buy my tee for the game there, but nobody knew it! I will not tell you the name of the friend, but he is English!' France surely won't be short of a tee or two this time, but better preparation may not be enough to end their long wait for a championship win in the English capital. But Yachvili hasn't abandoned all hope. 'When people think we are no good, that is when France do something,' he said \u2013 ominously for the home side. 'On paper, we would say England will beat us easily, because their rugby is more efficient and much better than us right now. But with French rugby, we never know.'","highlights":"England face France in the final round of the Six Nations on Saturday .\nFrance coach Philippe Saint-Andre has been heavily criticised following another\u00a0disappointing\u00a0Six Nations campaign .\nDimitri Yachvili concerned by high number of foreign players in Top 14 league .\nYachvili's goal-kicking secured France a 18-17 win at Twickenham in 2005 .\nIt was France's last victory at England HQ .\nSerge Betsen believes France are not developing enough young talent ."}

Berahino, who has scored 16 times for West Brom in the Barclays Premier League this season, was called into the England squad for the first time in November. The striker was born in Burundi and a delegation of officials from the tiny country in south-east Africa have been courting him this week. Saido Berahino (left, in action for West Brom against Aston Villa) has impressed England boss Roy Hodgson . Berahino was called in to the senior England squad last November but is also wanted by his native Burundi . Burundi, 126th in the FIFA rankings, play Mauritius in a friendly on March 25 and want to name the West Brom forward in their squad. England\u2019s head coach names his squad on Thursday for the Euro 2016 clash with Lithuania on March 27 at Wembley and the friendly in Turin against Italy four days later. Berahino has yet to represent the England team and he would still be permitted to switch nationalities under FIFA rules. Hodgson\u2019s striking options have been swelled by the return from injury of Daniel Sturridge, along with regular forwards Danny Welbeck and England captain Wayne Rooney. Hodgson has already made it clear that he intends to select Tottenham forward Harry Kane when he names his squad at the national stadium next week.

His emergence means Hodgson has a dilemma over who to select as his fifth striker. Berahino, an England Under-21 international, was named in the full squad for the first time in November for the clashes with Slovenia in a Euro 2016 qualifier and the friendly with Scotland at Celtic Park. He was an unused substitute in both games, but Hodgson predicted a bright future for the forward after he spent a week training with the national team.","highlights":"Saido Berahino's native Burundi send delegation of officials to court him .\nRoy Hodgson also has Daniel Sturridge, Danny Welbeck, Wayne Rooney and Harry Kane to pick and must decide whether to also call up Berahino .\nBerahino is yet to play for senior side so can still switch\u00a0allegiances ."}
{"article":"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)The Afghan woman is dragged onto a roof and hit with a stick, as a horde of angry, screaming men swarm around her. At one point, video shows her standing with her face covered in blood. She is pushed and falls over, and her beating continues with feet, with rocks, with boards. Then, in the last part of the video, her body is engulfed in flames -- though it's not known whether, by that point, she was already dead. This horrific scene played out in Kabul on Thursday. It's already had ripple effects, including a United Nations statement on Friday condemning what it called \"the brutal killing and burning of a 27-year-old mentally ill woman.\" That corresponds with what the woman's parents told CNN affiliate Tolo News, saying their daughter suffered from mental health problems for the last 16 years. It's not known whether her attackers knew this, or that it would have mattered. What motivated the mob, according to witnesses, was a belief that the targeted woman had burned the Quran. CNN hasn't seen any proof that she set a copy ablaze. Afghanistan's Ministry of Hajj and Religious Affairs has found no such evidence, either, according to Tolo. Mark Bowden, acting head of the U.N. Afghanistan mission, said that burning the Quran hurts efforts to promote \"understanding and mutual respect between cultures and religions.\" \"However, the brutal murder of this woman is an unspeakably horrendous act,\" Bowden said, \"that should result in those responsible being prosecuted, to the fullest extent possible, under Afghan law.\" Nahid, a 45-year-old woman who goes only by one name, told CNN what she saw and heard outside the Shah Do Shamshera shrine, which is opposite a mosque by the same name. A group of women were shouting at the eventual victim, accusing her of burning the Quran, according to Nahid. The woman yelled back. This got the attention of men nearby. Police tried to close gates to keep them out but it didn't work, said the witness, noting that many men jumped a fence and began beating the accused woman. The hits and kicks ended after someone poured fuel on the woman and lit her on fire, said Nahid, who watched from inside the shrine. \"(They) burned her and then threw her corpse away in the Kabul River,\" she said. As of Saturday, 11 people had been arrested in connection with the woman's death, according to Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Seddiqi. Seddiqi said that the investigation is ongoing. President Ashraf Ghani ordered two investigations related to the case -- one into the beating itself and another including religious scholars. His government is \"committed to protecting and safeguarding all Islamic values,\" including prohibitions on burning the Quran (if that is, indeed, what this woman did). That's a responsibility of the nation's security and legal system, Ghani said, not of individual Afghans. \"No individual is allowed to make oneself a judge and use violence to punish others in degrading manners,\" the President said. \"Launching personal trials and choosing who to punish stands in clear contradiction to Sharia and Islamic justice.\" CNN's Masoud Popalzai reported from Kabul, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.","highlights":"11 have been arrested in woman's beating, government spokesman says .\nShe was accused of burning the Quran, though there's no evidence yet she did .\nHer parents say their daughter suffered from mental illness for years ."}
{"article":"(CNN)The national office of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity changed its tune. Just two weeks ago, the national office condemned a racist chant that resulted in the shutdown of the University of Oklahoma SAE chapter, saying, \"The national fraternity does not teach such a racist, hateful chant, and this chant is not part of any education or training.\" The fraternity brothers probably \"learned the song from fellow chapter members,\" SAE said. But in a Friday statement, the SAE national office said otherwise. The OU chapter, SAE said, \"likely learned a racist chant while attending a national leadership school about four years ago.\" The fraternity invites hundreds of leaders to a six-day conference every year, SAE said. \"While attendees have little social time, there are occasions when participants can gather socially,\" the statement said. \"[Executive Director Blaine] Ayers said it is likely that during one of these social gatherings, some members shared the racist song that was recorded on video at the University of Oklahoma and shared through social media earlier this month.\" Ayers said the organization has no evidence the chant is widespread across the fraternity's 237 groups. \"Our investigation to date shows no evidence the song was widely shared across the broader organization,\" Ayers said. \"The song is horrific and does not at all reflect our values as an organization.\" But OU President David Boren, in revealing details of the university investigation on Friday, said the chant was an integral part of life in the local chapter. \"Over time the chant was formalized in the local SAE chapter and was taught to pledges as part of the formal and informal leadership process,\" he said. \"It is clear that during the four years since the chant was brought to the university campus, its existence was known by recent members and ... it became part of the institutionalized culture of the chapter.\" Boren said \"alcohol was readily available at the fraternity house\" on March 7 and some chapter members were drinking. He also said about a dozen high school students had been invited to the event and \"were exposed to the chant.\" The chant was discovered by the school newspaper and a student organization, which received the video clip via anonymous messages. The video shows party-bound students on a bus clapping, pumping their fists and laughing as they chant, \"There will never be a ni**** SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me. There will never be a ni**** SAE.\" The university cut ties with Sigma Alpha Epsilon after the video surfaced, as did the national fraternity, and both launched investigations. The university has disciplined fraternity members with punishment ranging from permanent withdrawals to sensitivity training. Fraternity officers have issued apologies. SAE issued questions-and-answers about the controversy, noting the fraternity plans to hire a director of diversity and inclusion. About 20% of SAE members self-identify as a minority or non-Caucasian, SAE said.","highlights":"Sigma Alpha Epsilon's national office issues a statement about racist chant .\nUniversity of Oklahoma SAE members \"likely\" learned chant at a national frat conference, SAE says ."}

{"article":"Kumar Sangakkara dismissed talk of prolonging his one-day international career after becoming the first man to hit centuries in four consecutive ODIs as Sri Lanka swept aside Scotland. The 37-year-old is due to retire from the 50-over game following the World Cup, but proved on Wednesday that he is still an elite performer at the top level with his 124 against Scotland following on from tons against Australia, England and Bangladesh. Sangakkara's sublime knock helped his side hammer the minnows by 148 runs. He was instrumental in making 363-9 before the Scots were bowled out for 215. Kumar Sangakkara celebrates after scoring a century for the fourth consecutive World Cup game . Sangakkara hit\u00a0124 from 95 balls against Scotland, the highest innings of the tournament so far . Freddie Coleman offered some resistance for Scotland but they were eventually soundly beaten . Calum MacLeod was bowled all ends up as Scotland could only muster 215 in response to Sri Lanka . Next week's quarter-final could therefore be his final ODI outing but, despite his prolific form, Sangakkara insists he will not play on after the tournament Down Under. 'It is never about whether you can play or not,' he told the BBC's Test Match Special. 'Retirement is not about form, it is about time and place and whether it feels right.' The wicketkeeper admitted in the post-match presentations following the 148-run win against the Scots that his body was finding it harder and harder to cope with the demands of modern cricket. 'It becomes hard, of course, now that I'm 37,' he said. 'I get a bit slower, the joints start creaking and aching. 'I'm pretty happy that I'm still playing, I consider myself pretty lucky to be part of such a good side. 'When everything is going well, things look bright.' Sangakkara has scored 14,189 runs in 403 one-day internationals, adding 12,203 in 130 Test matches in a near 15-year international career. After beginning steadily, Sangakkara accelerated as Scotland struggled to contain him. He cleared the ropes four times and added 13 fours, reaching his ton with a prod through third man. He eventually fell edging Josh Davey to wicket-keeper Matthew Cross. Angelo Mathews plundered 51 from 21 balls down the innings, including sixes from each of the four deliveries he faced immediately before being dismissed when going for another maximum - caught just inside the ropes by Freddie Coleman off the final ball of Matt Machan's costly fourth and final over.

{"article":"Leicester scrambled to a 16-12 victory over Newcastle at Kingston Park thanks to a controversial try five minutes from time. Trailing 12-6 at half-time, Freddie Burns pulled the Tigers back to 12-9 with a 59th-minute penalty and then in the 75th minute launched a crossfield kick into the Falcons' goal area where brothers Mathew and Alex Tait both went for the ball which rebounded for Tommy Bell to touch down. After a long delay the TMO approved the try and Burns converted for Leicester to clinch victory and move into the Aviva Premiership's top four. Alex Tait (left) and his brother Mathew Tait compete for the ball which led to Leicester's winning try . Had Newcastle won, London Welsh's relegation would have been confirmed given the Exiles lost 74-19 to Exeter on Saturday. Should Newcastle lose all six of their remaining fixtures, London Welsh would need to win all five of their own and earn a bonus point in at least three of them in order to avoid the drop. Despite being under constant pressure up front, Newcastle showed they were more than a match for Leicester with the ball in hand and Mathew Tait was left with no alternative but to take Tom Catterick's clever kick through into touch right on the Leicester line. Freddie Burns (centre) kicks\u00a0penalty during the Aviva Premiership match for the Tigers at Kingston Park . Newcastle promptly drove the line-out effectively for hooker Scott Lawson to score and Catterick converted for 7-0 after 10 minutes. It seemed Adam Thompstone must score when he cut back inside, but the winger slipped just inside the Newcastle 22 and the Falcons covered well before Richard Mayhew was caught offside at a scrum and Burns kicked a 15th-minute penalty to make it 7-3. Both Vereniki Goneva and number eight Laurence Pearce were making their bulk count with big runs in midfield as Leicester dominated possession. Scott Lawson (centre on the floor) celebrates scoring their first try with Will Welch in the first half . But Newcastle looked dangerous whenever they had the ball and Catterick had the crowd on their feet with a weaving run into the Tigers' 22 before he was stopped. Mathew Tait ran his brother's long kick out of defence right back at Newcastle and when Adam Powell went off his feet, Burns kicked his second penalty in the 29th minute to make it 7-6. Right on half-time, Newcastle showed what they can do within the ball in hand, producing a period of sustained pressure with wingers Sinoti Sinoti and Alex Tuilagi making big runs and the latter was inches from scoring. Sinoti Sinoti (centre) crosses the line to score the Falcons second try and give them a commanding lead . Newcastle recycled, lost the ball, recovered it and Powell showed real presence of mind to cut back inside and throw a lovely long pass to Sinoti for the winger to hurtle over in the corner with two tacklers hanging on. The try was given after the referee went to the TMO and it put Newcastle 12-6 up at the break, Catterick hitting the post with the conversion from the touchline. Newcastle lost two early second half line-outs deep in the Tigers' 22, and when Josh Furno was taken out in the line-out, Catterick was well short with the 45-metre penalty in the 48th minute. Leonardo Ghiraldini of Leicester (centre) feels the full force of a challenge from Will Welch and Gonzalo Tiesi . They were costly misses as Burns slotted a penalty in the 59th minute to make it 12-9 after Mark Wilson strayed offside. Newcastle kicked it straight out from the restart and were penalised at the scrum for collapsing. Burns had a chance to level the scores but his kick at goal from halfway was short. Leicester stepped up the pressure and Burns was nearly through with the Falcons showing signs of slipping off the pace. However, they seemed to be hanging on until Leicester mounted one last effort and Bell got the crucial score in minute 75.

It was, undoubtedly, a brilliant piece of play from the Brazilian, but immediately the inquest began as to how Chelsea had allowed the centre back so much space.

{"article":"United Nations (CNN)Tour groups and diplomats breeze past a nondescript display of 35 blown-up photos printed on poster board. Suddenly, one tourist catches a glimpse of the subject of one of the photos: a man whose eyes have been gouged out. Manjula Sharma, visiting the United Nations from India, gasps when she realizes what she is looking at. \"How could anybody do this?\" she said, while looking at the photos with a pained expression. \"It's not war. It's not drought. It's not natural calamity. It's torture.\" The exhibit is tucked away behind the lobby of the U.N. Secretariat Building. It's a no-frills exhibition of photos taken by a man who is being called \"Caesar,\" a Syrian government defector whose job it was to take photos of dead detainees for the military police. Caesar claimed to take up to 50 photos a day, and brought nearly 27,000 images like these out of the country. Captions on the photos show that many of them were taken inside military hospitals, and accuse Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime in the torture and killings. The photos show emaciated bodies. Some have eyes gouged out, some have genitals removed. And many are covered with wounds, the flesh peeling from their bodies. It's a sight that gave pause to Anders Frantzen, who works at the United Nations and was running late to a meeting. \"I told myself I really wanted to come back here and take a proper look. It looks like something you haven't seen since the Second World War. It's very bad,\" Frantzen said. \"It's difficult to put a face, an image to the numbers we hear about. So you see these pictures (and) it sort of puts things in a new perspective.\" While the photos have been shown before Congress and in media reports, many people, like Sharma, had no idea they existed. That's partly why Mouaz Moustafa, senior political adviser to the Coalition for a Democratic Syria, said he placed the photos in this location. He wanted to bring awareness to the public and put pressure on U.N. Security Council member states to vote for the International Criminal Court to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria. \"If you ask anyone about ISIS from Mississippi to Alabama, everyone is so well aware of this obviously evil entity,\" Moustafa said. \"If you compare it to the horrendous crimes of the Assad regime, it doesn't get, I feel, it doesn't get the same coverage.\" The Syrian Mission to the United Nations did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the exhibit.

The only goal of the game came from midfielder George Boyd who expertly fired home a volley past Joe Hart in the City goal. Burnley's win sends them above relegation threatened QPR and leaves Manchester City five points adrift of Chelsea having played two more games than their west London rivals. Find out how each player fared at Turf Moor with Sportmail's Craig Hope. BURNLEY (4-4-2) Tom Heaton 6.5 \u2013 Made a smart save from Dzeko in the first half but will have expected to be tested far more by the champions. Kieran Trippier 6.5 \u2013 Wasn\u2019t able to get forward as much as usual but stuck to his defensive duties and made a great interception header early on. Michael Duff 6.5 \u2013 Recalled to the line-up in place of Keane and hardly put a foot wrong. Booked for a foul on Aguero. Manchester City's Belgian defender Vincent Kompanyis closed down by Burnley striker Danny Ings . Jason Shackell 7 \u2013 A real captain\u2019s display alongside Duff in central defence to keep City\u2019s threat to a bare minimum. Ben Mee 6 \u2013 Former City trainee had his hands full with Zabaleta and was very fortunate not to concede a penalty when he brought him down late on. George Boyd 8 \u2013 Had already gone close with a spectacular volley from the edge of the box before firing the winner with the sweetest of strikes. Scott Arfield 7 \u2013 Tested Hart with decent effort in the first half but excelled in a central, working tirelessly to hold City at bay. Manchester City's Pablo Zabaleta and Burnley's Ashley Barnes battle for the ball  at Turf Moor . David Jones 7 \u2013 Another solid performance from the former Manchester United man, holding things together for Burnley in the heart of midfield. Ashley Barnes 6 \u2013 Showed his versatility by moving wide out on the left to accommodate Vokes and never stopped running. Danny Ings 7 \u2013 Posed a constant problem for Demichelis, and got the Argentine\u2019s forearm in the face for his troubles. Edin Dzeko  holds off Barnes  during the Premier League match between Burnley and Manchester City . Sam Vokes 6.5 \u2013 His first Premier League start for Burnley after a knee injury and kept Kompany on his toes throughout. Subs: Gilks, Keane, Reid (for Ings 90+3), Ward (for Vokes 87), Jutkiewicz, Wallace, Kightly. Scorer: Boyd 61 . Booked: Mee, Duff . MAN CITY (4-4-2) Joe Hart 6 \u2013 The England keeper had little to do besides pick the ball out of the net and couldn\u2019t be faulted for conceding Boyd\u2019s winner. Pablo Zabaleta 6.5 \u2013 Got forward well as usual but his hard work came to nothing as City wasted what few opportunities came their way. Sergio Aguero  evades the challenge of Michael Duff  during the  match between Burnley and Manchester City . Vincent Kompany 6 \u2013 City skipper was recalled after being dropped for one game, and his clearance header went straight to Boyd for Burnley\u2019s goal. Martin Demichelis 5 \u2013 Struggled to contain Ings. Booked for taking down the Burnley striker and could have seen red for a foul on Trippier shortly afterwards. Gael Clichy 5 \u2013 Failed to get forward enough and offer City a threat down the left. Will now sit out the Barcelona game through suspension. Jesus Navas 5 \u2013 Another lack-lustre showing from the Spain winger who incurred the wrath of Burnley fans who thought he overreacted to get Mee booked. Manchester City's Brazilian midfielder Fernandinho looks on during the  match against Burnley  at Turf Moor . Yaya Toure 6 \u2013 Tried to prompt City into life from midfield but there were none of the driving runs that can make him almost unplayable at times. Fernandinho 5 \u2013 Spent the last week in the headlines for his alleged bust-up with Kompany but did very little of note here apart from one volley high over the bar. David Silva 5.5 \u2013 Strangely subdued display from the Spaniard who is so often City\u2019s creative spark. Subbed by Jovetic having contributed very little. English striker Danny Ings stretches for the ball during the  match between Burnley and Manchester City . Sergio Aguero 5.5 \u2013 City\u2019s top scorer was off target with a series of attempts on goal and was lucky to escape punishment for a naughty challenge on Duff. Edin Dzeko 4.5 \u2013 A first-time shot that almost hit the corner flag summed up his display and no surprise to see him replaced by Bony with half an hour left. Subs: Caballero, Sagna, Mangala, Nasri, Lampard (for Toure 81), Jovetic (for Silva 74), Bony (for Dzeko 63). Booked: Demichelis . Referee: Andre Marriner 5 . Star man: George Boyd . Manchester City's Spanish midfielder David Silva vies with Burnley's English midfielder David Jones .","highlights":"George Boyd scored to help Burnley win 1-0 against Manchester City .\nTurf Moor erupted as the former Hull City man\u00a0scored\u00a0the winner .\nDefeat\u00a0severely\u00a0dents Manchester City's hopes of winning the league .\nVictory sends Clarets above QPR who were smashed by Crystal Palace ."}

Meyer, 26, proposed to Palin, 24, Friday night at a Rascal Flatts concert in Las Vegas, Palin said on her blog. \"The lead singer, Gary LeVox, dedicated 'Bless the Broken Road' to us, and then Dakota got down on one knee and proposed!\" she wrote. \"It's amazing to see what happens when you place everything in life in God's hands.\" Friends and well-wishers congratulated the couple on the news. As one person said in a comment on Meyer's Instagram, \"This is so 'MERICA that my mind is blown right now.\" Meyer received the nation's highest military honor for braving enemy fire in 2009 to recover 36 American and Afghan troops in Afghanistan. He was the third living recipient -- and the first Marine -- to be awarded the Medal of Honor for actions in Iraq or Afghanistan. Palin, the oldest daughter of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, has stayed in the public eye since her mother's failed vice presidential bid through appearances on \"Dancing with the Stars\" and a Lifetime show about raising her son, \"Bristol Palin: Life's a Tripp.\" She also released a best-selling memoir in 2011, \"Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far.\" She was previously engaged to Tripp's father, Levi Johnston. The couple met last year when Meyer visited Alaska to film \"Amazing America,\" Sarah Palin's show on Sportsman Channel, Bristol Palin said in her blog post. \"He met Tripp during that time, and I've seen him in a few places where our paths have crossed since. He's visited us in Alaska, and I've visited his wonderful family in Kentucky,\" she wrote. \"He's wonderful with Tripp and I'm so proud to be marrying him.\" The couple shared news of their engagement on social media. \"I'm definitely the luckiest guy ever,\" Meyer said in an Instagram of the pair tagged #shesaidyes. Bristol Palin shared an Instagram picture of a ring and another of the happy couple smooching. \"Truly the luckiest girl in the world, cannot wait to marry this man!!!!\" she said. The couple started recently began sharing images on social media of themselves together. Palin posted a photo last week of the couple out in the snow with Tripp. Meyer has also shared a few pictures of him with Sarah Palin. \"Thank you for being the amazing person that you are. I appreciate your leadership and dedication to our country!\" he said in a post on her birthday in February. Sarah Palin also congratulated the couple, noting that Meyer \"flew up North\" to ask Bristol Palin's father and grandfather for her hand in marriage. \"Our families couldn't be happier for Bristol and Dakota! We're honored to welcome Dakota into our family.  He's an American hero and patriot whose service to our country -- like all his fellow Medal of Honor recipients -- has been above and beyond the call of duty; but even more important is he's a good and kind man who loves Bristol and Tripp, and is loved by them,\" she said on Facebook. \"Yes, God working behind the scenes to turn beauty from ashes.

{"article":"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN)Pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk have withdrawn all heavy weapons from the front lines in accordance with a recent peace deal, the rebel group Donetsk People's Republic said Saturday. On the other side, the Kiev-backed Donetsk regional authority said Ukrainian forces also withdrew all heavy weapons from the front lines in Donetsk, but added that in a 24-hour period from Friday to Saturday pro-Russian militants carried out 46 attacks, all of which were repelled, according to Col. Valentin Fedichev. A shaky ceasefire has been in place in Donetsk and the neighboring Luhansk region, the center of a months-long conflict between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian government forces. The estimated number of people killed in eastern Ukraine since April 2014 now exceeds 6,000 \"in spite of successive ceasefires,\" the United Nations Human Rights Office said earlier this week. The escalation in fighting in recent weeks, particularly near the Donetsk airport and in the Debaltseve area, resulted in hundreds of deaths, both civilian and military, according to the United Nations report. The report paints a picture of \"merciless devastation of civilian lives and infrastructure,\" said U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein. He called for all sides to adhere to the peace deal, reached last month in Minsk, Belarus, which calls for a ceasefire in many of the conflict's hotspots. Victoria Butenko contributed from Kiev.

{"article":"A passionate tree surgeon created a video to show what his unique, dangerous and perhaps misunderstood job entails. Capturing footage of himself on a GoPro camera, Cezary Romanowski documented his experiences over a period of several months. The video begins with Cezary, a tree surgeon from Poland, sharpening the teeth of his chainsaw and filling it up with fuel while in a snowy woodland. Suitably prepared, Cezary ties himself to a tree and makes his way up it using spikes \u2013 also known as gaffs or spurs \u2013 attached to his chainsaw boots. What follows is a fast-paced montage sequence showing Cezary dispatching trees of all shapes and sizes. Sawing through a particularly large trunk, the tree surgeon appears to balance in the air before taking one hand off his chainsaw \u2013 while its teeth continue to rotate \u2013 and reaching for a wedge. Cezary is filmed sharpening the teeth of his chainsaw before filling it with fuel in a snowy wooded area . Cezary prepares by attaching himself to the tree before climbing up the trunk and cutting it from the top . Jamming it in the gap, Cezary makes his way around the tree, systematically tapping the wedge in further as he goes, until the crane is able to lift the top of the trunk away. Another clip of the tree surgeon shows him drawing a smiley face onto a piece of trunk. While the following one presents the three stages in which he safely chops down a rather large tree positioned in the middle of a residential area. The tree surgeon uses\u00a0spikes \u2013 also known as gaffs or spurs \u2013 attached to his chainsaw boots to help him climb . Cezary demonstrates how sharp his axe is by running its blade along a piece of paper and shredding it . Cezary also shows off how sharp his axe is by running its blade along a piece of paper, after cutting down a tree and throwing his chainsaw behind his back to let it hang by its cord. The video concludes with the tree surgeon chopping off the many branches of a tree, after winching himself into position. Before looking into the camera, turning away and demonstrating the trust he has for his tools by resting his chainsaw on his neck.

The tree surgeon cuts through a huge trunk with ease while using a wedge to help him . Tree surgeons, or arborists as they are formally known, cultivate, manage and study individual trees, shrubs and vines. Their job therefore differs to that of a logger or a forester, who focus on large areas of woodland. Often dangerous, tree surgeons are sometimes required to work near power wires but may also plan, consult, write reports and give legal testimony. In the UK, arborists can gain qualifications up to and including a Master's degree. Cezary shows off how much he trusts his tools as he walks away from the camera balancing the chainsaw on his neck .","highlights":"GoPro captures\u00a0Cezary Romanowski's experiences over several months .\nTree surgeon climbs trunks with spikes and chops them down with ease .\nThe arborist demonstrates\u00a0how sharp the blade of his axe is on paper .\nDramatic shot sees Cezary throw chainsaw behind his head while on tree ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Football is the most widely played sport among French youths. Yet, it struggles to attract and retain girls. How can football serve as a tool of socialization when it remains the domain of young boys and men? Algeria coach Christian Gourcuff, who has a coached a number of Ligue 1 clubs, notes that for a long time, women's football \"was a sport totally marginalized.\" Stereotypes abounded that the sport was too rough, too masculine for girls to play. They were much more likely to compete in basketball, ride horseback, or dance, such as Ma\u00efmouna Coulibaly, whose dance company, Les Ambianceuses, is internationally recognized (though overshadowed by her brother, Amedy Coulibaly, the kosher supermarket shooter in the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo massacre). But change is afoot. Since the late 1980s, the French Football Federation (FFF) has promoted the sport to women and girls. \"Over the past 10 years, there has been a considerable development of the women's game,\" said Gourcuff. Former player and ex-Paris Saint-Germain official Jean-Michel Moutier concurred. Over the past decade \"girls have significantly increased the level of play,\" he said. \"I am agreeably surprised by the quality of certain female football matches.\" The sport's increased television presence helps significantly, especially broadcasts of the women's World Cup. \"That has changed a bit the image of women's football,\" Gourcuff said, \"notably among young girls.\" Farid El Alagui, who now plays for Scottish club Hibernian, noticed a dramatic difference in how women's football is perceived back home. \"If you look at the French national team,\" he said, \"they've been really good.\" Les Bleues are presently third in FIFA's world ranking and hopes are high for their success at the women's World Cup in Canada between June 6 and July 5. The professional women's league is also responsible for encouraging more girls to play. \"There are big clubs like Paris Saint-Germain,\" El Alagui said, \"who are very good and the level of play is quite high.\" Such examples foster confidence to try to the sport. \"I think a lot of girls want to play football,\" he said. \"They're just scared.\" However, enrollment statistics paint a less exuberant portrait. At ASVCM only seven out of 345 players in the club's football school are girls, and two more play with the club's youth teams in competitions. Such statistics are mirrored nationally. During the 2013-14 season, there were 50,516 licensed girls in the Under-6 to Under-20 demographic, as compared to 997,511 for boys of the same age. While few in number, the young girls at ASVCM -- a local sports club based in a town 12 kilometers south of Paris -- are welcomed and respected, observed Catherine Ledem\u00e9, who has volunteered with the club for more than a decade. \"They are often the 'mascots' of the team,\" she said. Moreover, they excel on the field. The football section's president Marc Girard proudly boasted that two of ASVCM's young players are in formation with PSG's women's team. For Ledem\u00e9, who week-in and week-out ensures the club's conviviality, \"football has strong social values.\" She supports girls playing football, regardless of the game's stereotypes or image, a sentiment indicative of changing or changed attitudes. More is needed, but the continued success of the women's league and national team will perhaps inspire more girls to take up the sport.","highlights":"French women's football has long been marginalized, stereotyped as a sport that is too rough and masculine for girls to play .\nIn recent years an increased television presence has raised the profile of the game, especially broadcasts of the women's World Cup .\nEnrollment statistics remain low with only about 50,000 licensed girls under 20 years of age compared to almost 1 million boys ."}
{"article":"Mauricio Pochettino has confessed to a late-night darts habit and has even organised his home viewing arrangements so he can have an eye on the arrows as he studies football matches beamed into his home from around Europe. 'I was watching the Europa League, on Thursday night, all the games,' said Tottenham boss Pochettino. 'I had two screens set up. One with the Europa League on, and the other with Premier League Darts. It's true. 'We don't have darts in Argentina but ever since I arrived in Southampton I've been a fan. I don't play and I've not been to see it live. I prefer to watch at home.' Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has revealed he is a big fan of watching the darts at his home . While the Spurs boss is not happy to have been knocked out of the Europa League he does get to watch darts . Some of his Spurs players share his love for the game. Jan Vertonghen, Kyle Walker, Danny Rose and Andros Townsend, were spotted at Alexandra Palace in January watching the semi-finals of the World Darts Championships. Tottenham's exit from the Europa League, beaten in the second round by Fiorentina, has brought the consolation of allowing their Argentine manager to tune in for the Premier League Darts fixtures on Thursday nights. Pochettino has been watching the likes of Phil 'The Power' Taylor on television recently at his home . Andros Townsend has been pictured at the darts, and his girlfriend Hazel O'Sullivan is a walk-on girl . 'I was not happy to go out, my preference would have been to be playing against Roma,' said Pochettino, but it has been another difficult season for English clubs in European competition. Only Everton remain in the Europa League, while Arsenal and Manchester City must overturn first-leg deficits next week in Monaco and Barcelona respectively, if they are to reach the last eight of the Champions League. Chelsea were knocked out of the Champions League, and Arsenal and Manchester City face uphill tasks . Everton are the only English team remaining in the Europa League after Spurs and Liverpool's exits . 'European teams have an advantage on English teams,' said Pochettino. 'The most difficult period of the season in England is Christmas when they have a break. In February and March it is very tough for the English teams. 'The number of games we play is more than the European teams. This is the key. Teams in the other leagues are fresher then the English teams. 'Our competition is the toughest in the world. Maybe this explains the results in Europe. Teams like Paris Saint-Germain are only focused on the Champions League. Chelsea are focused on the Capital One Cup and the Premier League. Pochettino says the struggles of English teams like Spurs is down to the strength of the Premier League . Harry Kane celebrates his second goal against Queens Park Rangers in Spurs' win at Loftus Road last week . 'It's not an excuse but the reality. It's very difficult to arrive fresh in the same way another team from Europe arrives fresh in the Champions League or the Europa League.' Spurs, sixth in the Premier League with 10 to play, have won twice since they lost to Fiorentina and were beaten in the Capital One Cup final by Chelsea. Like any darts fan, Pochettino knows the way his team finish will be all-important. They are at fourth-placed Manchester United on Sunday and victory will boost their bid to qualify for next season's Champions League.","highlights":"Mauricio Pochettino has set up his home to watch football and darts .\nThe Spurs manager has never watched the sport live, though .\nPochettino watches Premier League Darts alongside the Europa League .\nBut he would prefer to still be in the competition playing Roma .\nTottenham boss says the Premier League disadvantages its own teams ."}
{"article":"(CNN)By all appearances Shaun Harrison was living an exemplary life. He was a dean at a Boston public high school. He mentored young people. And, Harrison regularly attended services at a local church for a decade, before leaving in 2012, according to the church's pastor. Now, Harrison is charged with armed assault with intent to murder, aggravated assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. He's also facing multiple weapons charges. Harrison is accused of shooting one of his students in the head. While he was working as \"dean of academy\" at English High, Harrison was also running a marijuana distribution enterprise, according to Suffolk County Assistant District Attorney, David Bradley.  At an arraignment hearing Thursday, Bradley said the 55-year-old now-former dean shot a 17-year-old student he had allegedly hired to sell marijuana. The teenager, who called Harrison \"Rev\" told authorities he was regularly mentored by Harrison, according to police documents. Bradley said in a news release that the two got into a dispute after leaving Harrison's home Tuesday evening.  They were walking along a street when Harrison then \"produced a handgun, pointed it at the back of the victim's head and fired,\" Bradley said in a news release. The incident was captured on surveillance footage, but the police have not released it. The teen, who has not been named by police yet, was shot behind the right ear, according to a police report. He is expected to survive his injuries, Bradley's release said. Harrison had worked in various positions with the Boston Public Schools since 2010.  He had been \"dean of academy\" at English High School since January 5, where \"he provided services, like finding housing for homeless students or social services or disciplinary alternatives to suspension,\" said Denise Snyder, a representative for Boston Public Schools. His employment has been \"terminated effective immediately,\" Snyder said. The Rev. Dr. Gregory Groover, pastor of the Charles Street AME Church where Harrison attended services said the allegations against Harrison aren't consistent with the man he knows. \"I was stunned beyond description,\" Groover said when he heard about  Harrison's arrest. Groover said Harrison was already an ordained Baptist minister when he came to the Charles Street AME Church.  He recalled Harrison usually attended services alone, but he \"got along with everyone.\" \"He seemed to consistently care with a deep heart for saving young people who were in the streets or gang related, prison-involved,\" Groover said.  \"That was the population that his life seemed to center around.\" A not guilty plea was automatically entered on Harrison's behalf.  He posted $250,000 bail and is  under house arrest, according to police documents.  He has been ordered to \"stay away and have no contact with the victim\" and wear a GPS monitor, the DA's release said. He is scheduled to be back in court on April 6. CNN's multiple attempts to reach an attorney for Harrison were unsuccessful. CNN's Aaron Cooper, Chuck Johnston and Alexandra Field contributed to this report.","highlights":"Shaun Harrison is accused of shooting one of his students in the head .\nThe student,17, was hired to sell marijuana for Harrison, district attorney says .\nThe teen is expected to survive; the dean, who is out on bail, has been ordered to stay away from him ."}
{"article":"There were call-ups for three uncapped players and an unexpected recall for Ben Stokes but they were all overshadowed in England's Test squad to tour the Caribbean by the return of Jonathan Trott. Nothing seemed less likely than this when Trott left England's Ashes tour 16 months ago after his public ordeal at the hands of Mitchell Johnson. The road back since he returned home after the first Test in Brisbane with a 'stress-related condition' later diagnosed as situational anxiety has been a long and tortuous one. Warwickshire batsman Jonathan Trott has been recalled to the England Test squad for their upcoming tour . Trott has completed his recovery from a stress-related condition that stretches back to the Ashes in 2013 . Trott will compete with Adam Lyth for an opening batting slot alongside Alastair Cook . Yet against all the odds and after the key development of working with renowned sports psychologist Steve Peters, Trott is back and will compete with Adam Lyth to become Alastair Cook's opening partner in the three-Test series. There will be those who worry about Trott's fragility but mental injuries should be treated no differently from physical ones and now he has been given a clean bill of health it is right that the 33-year-old should be picked. Lyth gets the nod ahead of Sam Robson and his emerging county colleague Alex Lees, and becomes one of an incredible six Yorkshiremen in the squad after scoring 1,489 championship runs at 67.68 last season. Adil Rashid, another Yorkshireman, and Durham fast bowler Mark Wood are the other newcomers. Rashid made the last of his 10 limited-overs appearances for England six years ago but is a more mature leg-spinning all-rounder and person now at 27. Stokes, who missed out on the World Cup after a miserable year of form, returns in place of the injured Chris Woakes, but England see him more as a No 6 batsman and fourth seamer in Test cricket. England hope Moeen Ali will overcome a side injury to join the tour in time for the second Test in Grenada. In his absence Rashid will compete for the No 1 slow-bowling spot with Kent's reliable off-spinner James Tredwell, who edged out Surrey's Zafar Ansari for the final place in the squad.

{"article":"Brazil coach Dunga has recalled Real Madrid full back Marcelo for friendlies against France and Chile later this month in a squad he said mixed blend youth and experience. There were no surprises in the squad, his last before the Copa America in June, with all 23 players having some international experience, including Fabinho, the 21-year old Monaco right back. 'Marcelo is a regular again at Real Madrid, he has experience in World Cups with Brazil and we are trying to cast a wide net,' Dunga said. 'We are mixing youth and experience.' Brazil coach Dunga has selected his latest squad ahead of international friendlies against France and Chile . 'We brought Fabinho in before and we hope he can get a run of matches with Monaco. He is a right back but has been playing midfield in Monaco.' Brazil face France in Paris on March 26 and Chile at the Emirates stadium in London three days later. Dunga also recalled Sao Paulo midfielder Souza and Santos forward Robinho. Striker Diego Tardelli was the only one of the three Brazilian players who recently signed for Chinese and Arab clubs to make the squad. Marcelo, the Real Madrid full back, is included in the squad having been left out in previous selections . 'They are starting the pre-season, we haven't seen them on a daily basis,' he said of the other two, Everton Ribeiro and Ricardo Goulart. 'So we reduced the risk by not choosing players who are not at peak condition. We wanted players who are already up to a competitive speed.' Dunga took command of the Brazil team for the second time in July, just days after Brazil were dumped out their own World Cup 7-1 by Germany. He has won all six of his matches in charge, conceding just one goal. The March fixtures will be the last before Dunga announces his squad for the Copa America in Chile in June. Chelsea's Brazilian midfielder Willian is one of five players selected from the Premier League . Full squad: .

With what it says is a $2 billion budget, the group produces slick videos in which sexy bearded jihadists are paraded as potential husbands and burka-clad jihadi brides carry Kalashnikovs while extolling the virtues of the utopian Caliphate and a \"guaranteed ticket to paradise.\" Aqsa Mahmood, 19, left home for university one morning in November 2013 never to return. Instead of going to classes, she travelled to Syria; last February she married a jihadi fighter, and since then she has become a notorious poster girl for ISIS. What is so unusual about Aqsa is that she was given every chance in life: privately educated and offered freedoms that many other Muslim girls would envy. And while most were quick to condemn the Mahmood family for missing the signs of radicalization, 18 months on they remain none the wiser as to what prompted her to run away -- Aqsa's parents had actually warned their children of the need to avoid extremist websites. Following the terror attacks in London on July 7, 2005, the then Prime Minister Tony Blair insisted those responsible were motivated by an \"evil ideology,\" a \"perversion of Islam that promoted absurd grievances,\" and that they had nothing to do with the war in Iraq, but he was wrong: the Iraq \"adventure\" opened the gates of hell, and today young Muslims are being seduced by an updated narrative. For over a decade mosque leaders have been asked to eradicate extremism but they are no more than glorified gatekeepers whose lives bear little relevance to those of most modern day Muslims. The need to tackle radical preachers has crushed political debate and created a dangerous vacuum which is now being filled outside of mosques. Every new atrocity is invariably followed by useless public statements of sorrow from so-called \"Muslim leaders,\" further increasing the anger felt by the younger community -- successfully drawing young Muslims away from the path of violence takes more than routine declarations that \"Islam is a religion of peace.\" It is easy enough to dismiss the words of wannabe radical jihadists as little more than the posturing of nihilistic adolescents, but the steady stream of recruits to ISIS cannot be ignored. Several years ago al Qaeda recruitment propaganda included videos of men with long beards ranting in Arabic in front of a black flag, followed by grainy footage of a truck blowing up as it drove towards Americans. It wasn't particularly effective as a recruitment tool, but then they only needed a handful of recruits to change our society for ever. Today ISIS runs a powerful, slick, modern social media machine distributing messages daily across many different platforms. Their propaganda contains the same violent, distorted interpretation of Islam but it is more advanced than anything al Qaeda ever produced, and the authorities cannot police it or compete with it. For many, the greatest shock has been young girls like Aqsa wanting to leave behind their Western comforts and freedoms to join ISIS, but why should it be a surprise that young Muslim women are as angry as their male counterparts? There is no single road map to recruitment, but for a teenager becoming a Jihadi bride or fighter is much more appealing than becoming a suicide bomber, however distorted that logic may seem to us. Full of adolescent frustration, young Muslims are being lured into a romanticized and glamorous world which bears no relation to the misery actually inflicted by ISIS. It doesn't matter if the narrative is false, because ISIS is winning the propaganda war: the inability of the mainstream to deal with the anger felt by the Muslim community provides cannon fodder for the hatemongers. ISIS is left unchallenged on double standards of foreign policy, Israel, rendition, torture, or Assad's reign, which has left 200,000 dead, because there is nothing that Western governments can say without being accused of duplicity and double standards. Aqsa's family describe her as a \"bedroom radical\" of the type the British Government has been desperate to combat by trying to shut down websites and social media. Yet last year the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence found \"little evidence to support the contention that the internet plays a dominant role in the process of radicalization.\" A concentration on social media avoids the real world social relationships which help create terrorists. Many young Muslim people asserting their identity in an Islamophobic society detest the hypocrisy of their elders, whose cultural and sectarian traditions they consider irrelevant to modern day Islam. While mosques pay lip service to the \"brotherhood of man\" they exclude 50% of the community by discouraging women from attending, and anyone below the age of fifty is told to shut up and show respect. As for racial unity, it is at best tokenistic and at worst institutionally racist. Young British Muslims live a schizophrenic existence, stuck between their immigrant parents' cultural identity and that of the West which doesn't want them. Extremists exploit this identity crisis by offering them a new life. Most parents wouldn't know if their teenagers were drinking or having sex, let alone being groomed by ISIS; many young Muslims -- already adept at living a double life -- will hide their digital footprint in exactly the same way. In many cases, there is tremendous relief for parents when a teenager comes home one day and announces she is becoming religious, rather than saying she is pregnant or on drugs, but it also gives rise to a false sense of security. The failure to deal with the grooming of underage girls by ISIS is a child protection issue: when a paedophile makes contact with a child, he builds up trust over several months, convincing the child not discuss anything with her parents. When the time is right he convinces the child to leave her family and join him. The process is identical in radicalization by ISIS. Thousands of young people across Europe are at risk of being trafficked to Syria for marriage and holy war. In any other situation, they would be regarded as children -- yet pin the ISIS label on them and the knee jerk reaction is one of condemnation. The exploitation of the politics of fear combined with tougher terror laws has created a climate of fear for Muslims who are portrayed as threatening a \"civilized\" way of life. We are quick to forget recent history: the disastrous treatment of the Catholic community in Northern Ireland produced a sense of burning injustice which acted as a recruiting sergeant for the IRA for more than four decades. Today, Muslims are being dealt with in the same way.","highlights":"Lawyer Aamer Anwar says ISIS's recruitment tactics differ widely from those of al Qaeda .\nISIS engages in one-to-one dialogue with potential jihadis while sat 2,000 miles away: Anwar .\nGroup runs a slick, modern social media machine distributing messages on different platforms ."}
{"article":"(CNN)A Spanish dolphin trainer who was accused on social media of abusing the animals has been found dead, a source with the Spanish National Police told CNN on Saturday. Jose Luis Barbero was expected to become vice president of the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, CNN affiliate WSB reported. He was found dead inside his vehicle in the public parking lot of the Palma de Mallorca airport on the island of Mallorca, the source said. The source said the case is being treated as a suicide. Georgia Aquarium Chairman and CEO Mike Leven issued a strongly worded statement that said: . \"Georgia Aquarium began a search for truth in hopes of disproving these unsubstantiated claims. Sadly, (Barbero)  and his family received death threats, and groups and individuals rushed to judge him.  He was not given the right or the privilege to be considered innocent until proven guilty ... His death is untimely, unnecessary and unjust.\" Barbero, 59, went missing recently and authorities had started searching for him. In February, videos circulated of animal trainers in Spain allegedly hitting and kicking dolphins. Posters on social media claimed Barbero was one of them. The Georgia Aquarium questioned the authenticity of the videos but put his employment on hold. The video footage is grainy and dark, and faces are difficult to make out. Trainers are making fast foot and hand motions in the dolphins' direction, but it is unclear if these are blows. CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the videos. Barbero's employer in Spain, Marineland Mallorca, denied the allegations and said it planned to take legal action against Barbero's accusers, according to the Georgia Aquarium.","highlights":"Dolphin trainer Jose Luis Barbero was found dead in his vehicle, Spanish police say .\nGrainy viral video triggered abuse allegations as he prepared to work at the Georgia Aquarium ."}
{"article":"England's Matt Ford will take a narrow lead into the third day of the Africa Open after carding a second-round 66 at East London Golf Club. Ford took advantage of calmer conditions for the morning starters to card six birdies and an eagle, with his only blemishes coming on the ninth and 17th. That left the 36-year-old 11 under par and one ahead of Spain's Eduardo de la Riva, who also returned a 66 containing eight birdies and two bogeys. England's Matt Ford will take a narrow lead into the third day of the Africa Open at the East London Golf Club . Ford tees off on the eighth hole during the second round of the Africa Open at East London Golf Club . Ford, who was about to spend a winter working for Royal Mail before coming through November's European Tour qualifying school at the 10th attempt, said: 'I don't think you can ever get all of it out of the round. 'I missed a short one on 17 and hit a poor tee shot off nine, so those were a couple of mistakes, but you're always going to make a few of those. I would have taken 11 under at the beginning of the day. 'I missed a couple of putts but I holed a couple and I holed a wedge (from 119 yards for his eagle on the par-four 12th) so I played some good stuff. I've been hitting it pettty steady all year and the way the golf course is suits me; you are not hitting full out shots, you are hitting quite a lot of half shots. I've had good control of the ball so far this week.' Andy Sullivan missed the cut after a disappointing 77 in the Africa Open left him five over par . Both of De la Riva's bogeys came in his first three holes, but the world number 369 responded with a flurry of birdies to keep Ford well within in his sights. 'I played a very good round today with good golf and good putts. I am very happy with the first two rounds,' he said. South Africa have provided all five previous winners of this event and four home players were inside the top seven on the leaderboard, with Jaco van Zyl and Erik Van Rooyen three off the lead on eight under alongside France's Gregory Havret. Newly appointed Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke\u00a0carded six birdies and two bogeys in a 68 . Van Zyl, who finished joint second the Joburg Open on Sunday, also shot 66 and said: 'Yesterday was really tough out there and I was very chuffed to pull two under out of it. I got it a lot easier this morning and when that happens you try to capitalise.' Van Zyl's compatriots Neil Schietekat and Trevor Fisher were one shot further back along with English pair David Howell and John Parry, Chile's Mark Tullo and Germany's Max Kieffer, whose 63 was the lowest score of the day. Ireland's Kevin Phelan, who shared the overnight lead with Ford, could only add a 72 to his opening 67 to remain five under, one ahead of newly appointed Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke, who carded six birdies and two bogeys in a 68.

Arsene Wenger always thought it was harder for a London club to win the league because there were so many derbies, and this match rather supported his theory. Chelsea still collected three points but, by Jove, it was tough. Their defence was stretched in a way that it was not at Wembley on Sunday and, by the end, Chelsea were happy to hoof the ball forward or run it into corners to take time out of the game.

Eden Hazard finished off a well-worked Chelsea move to score the only goal of the game. Check out more stats from our Match Zone . West Ham have won a single league fixture since Christmas, but it did not look like it here. They had chances, real chances, to wrest the points from the league leaders, and it says much that Chelsea\u2019s prime performers were once again the central defensive core of John Terry, Gary Cahill and Thibaut Courtois in goal. And Eden Hazard, of course. Always Hazard. He scored the goal, never stopped wanting or carrying the ball, and left the field hobbling, as always, due to a standard battering. Not that West Ham were excessively dirty \u2014 Chelsea had four bookings to West Ham\u2019s three \u2014 more that a player of Hazard\u2019s ability is always going to attract a certain kind of attention. The group hug that Terry, Cahill, Courtois and Branislav Ivanovic shared at the end should have included Hazard; in his own way, he is as hard as any of them. If Chelsea maintain their supremacy, this is one of those games that will be remembered the day the title is won, one of those they-shall-not-pass performances, all bodies flying, desperate lunges and the ball in row Z if needs be. West Ham were left banging their heads against a wall \u2014 no wild metaphor in the case of Cheikhou Kouyate, who ran face first into the back of Terry\u2019s skull late in the second half. Both required treatment, but one came off considerably worse. Hazard runs to Ramires after the pair combined for Chelsea's opening strike which gave Jose Mourinho's men a vital victory . Adrian makes an acrobatic save to keep West Ham in the game as Chelsea threaten to extend their advantage . Adrian keeps out another Chelsea attack as he thwarts Diego Costa on a busy night for West Ham's goalkeeper . West Ham have now failed to score in six of their last seven Premier League\u00a0matches against Chelsea, including the last five in a row. Eden Hazard\u2019s last four Premier League goals have come away from home after a run of 11 consecutive home goals . It is fair to say if they are ever pondering a fresh material to use in the construction of those black boxes in aircraft, Terry\u2019s cranium may have to be considered. Alas, Diafra Sakho. It is hard to remember a striker getting in so many excellent positions for such paltry return. He knows where to be, he just lacks the clinical touch when he gets there and, thwarted by his own failings and the excellence of Courtois, West Ham drew a blank. Yes, Chelsea could have scored more, too. This was not a one-sided game \u2014 but we expect Chelsea pressure on the goal. They have world-class finishers and magicians in midfield. The surprise was West Ham going toe-to-toe with them, particularly, in the second half. Right up until the last minute they were still heaping on pressure. Chelsea have matches at Queens Park Rangers and Arsenal, and a home fixture against Crystal Palace, to come, so nobody should underestimate the challenge to their championship ambition contained in a London derby. This was one of the hardest-fought wins of Chelsea\u2019s season \u2014 every bit as much of a proving ground as a wet Wednesday in Wigan, or whatever northern outpost is the current venue for popular cliche. Hazard is the Premier League's most fouled player this season and he goes down after some attention from Mark Noble . Hazard writhes around on the Boleyn Ground pitch in agony but continued to play on for the title favourites . Thibaut Courtois parries the ball with his foot as Nolan closes in during a heart-in-mouth moment for Chelsea's rearguard . Courtois was once again called in to action as West Ham appeal in vain for a handball against Gary Cahill (floored) Mourinho\u2019s favourite scoreline is apparently 2-0 away. He regards it as the sign of a controlled, confident, emphatic performance in a close game. They certainly went in search of it here and came very close on three occasions in the second half. In the 56th minute, a beautiful through pass from Hazard set Ramires clear on goal. He cut inside but his delicate side-footed finish struck the inside of the far post and rebounded into the hands of Adrian. Minutes later, West Ham\u2019s goalkeeper was in the right place again after Terry found Hazard whose cross picked out Ramires at the far post. This time there was no good fortune. The save was superb. There were six minutes of injury time due to the Terry-Kouyate collision and Chelsea came close to wrapping it up then. Hazard broke, for the last time, drawing Adrian yet squaring the ball unselfishly to Willian, whose shot was somehow smothered on its way to the net. The single goal was the fairer margin of victory, however. West Ham did not deserve to appear mastered in the scoreline after a simply thrilling second half. Kurt Zouma gets stuck in against Enner Valencia as the centre half continued to play in the holding role in midfield . Zouma continued in midfield after playing the holding role in the Capital One Cup final, and regularly battled with Kevin Nolan . Cheikhou Kouyate unsuccessfully shoots at goal under the ever-watchful eye of Chelsea skipper John Terry . Cahill attempts to tackle Diafra Sakho as Kouyate is poised to pounce on the loose ball . The first wasn\u2019t bad either, West Ham going close in the 17th minute, when a cross from Mark Noble found a dangerous area at the near post where Kevin Nolan caused localised chaos and Kouyate arrived late only to have his shot blocked by the shins of Courtois. Two minutes later, a run by Enner Valencia opened a gap to slide a pass through to Sakho, who missed his kick. More frustration was to come. In the 37th minute, Carl Jenkinson crossed from the right and the ball dropped perfectly to Sakho, directly in front of goal, but planting his header into the ground, landing safely in the hands of Courtois. After 53 minutes, Courtois saved from Sakho again, pushing out a shot one-handed, just the right side of Nolan. He saved from Sakho after 60 minutes, too, and when he finally spilled a Valencia shot 12 minutes later, the outstanding Cahill cleared as Sakho threatened in vain. It was not all wastefulness by West Ham, though. In the 15th minute, a mix-up by Ivanovic saw Valencia about to speed past Terry and go through on goal. The ever-alert Cesc Fabregas probes into West Ham territory with Valencia and Mark Noble close by . West Ham werew forced into an early change as Winston Reid pulled up in the eighth minute with James Collins coming on in his place . Mourinho and Allardyce share a moment prior to kick-off on a crisp night in east London . The Chelsea captain weighed the odds in a split second and hauled him down, rugby style. Did he prevent a goalscoring opportunity? Probably. Did he play the percentage chance of referee Andre Marriner showing him a red card 30 yards out and early in the match, with Cahill covering, if not really in a position to stop? Undoubtedly. Did he get away with it? Yes. Yellow card. It was a cynical move, but the smart one, too. It was seven minutes later that the winner was scored. To be beaten by a header playing Chelsea is no disgrace; when the man on the end of the ball is Hazard, however, a manager has a right to be aggrieved. Sam Allardyce certainly looked it as the Chelsea man completed a headed goal that was as casually taken as a tap-in, with West Ham\u2019s defence appallingly lax. James Collins had replaced the injured Winston Reid after five minutes, but that was no excuse. The back four had plenty of time to bed in but went to sleep doing so. It was a neat build-up involving Hazard and Cesc Fabregas, who slipped the ball to Ramires overlapping on the right. He had too much room and cut the ball back to leave West Ham flat-footed, Hazard sneaking between the statues to glance a stooping header past Adrian. It was too easy, and it is hard enough to beat Chelsea already \u2014 a point Allardyce seemed to be making on the touchline.","highlights":"Hazard nodded Ramires' cross past Adrian in the 22nd minute to give the Premier League leaders the upper hand .\nJose Mourinho's men extended their unbeaten run to seven games .\nChelsea maintain their five point lead over Manchester City with 11 games remaining .\nCheck out all the stats from our Match Zone ."}
{"article":"Aberdeenshire, Scotland (CNN)In an exclusive interview ahead of his U.S. tour -- and ahead of his 10-year wedding anniversary -- Prince Charles paid tribute to the \"brilliant\" way his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, has taken on the \"real, real challenge\" of defining her public role. \"It's always marvelous to have somebody who, you know, you feel understands and wants to encourage. Although she certainly pokes fun if I get too serious about things. And all that helps,\" Prince Charles told CNN. The couple first visited the U.S. together as newlyweds in 2005, and Camilla was confronted by hardcore Princess Diana fans with abusive placards. Polls at the time found that between 57% and 73% of Brits opposed Charles' new wife being known as queen. If you go back even further, to 1997, the year Diana died, an Ipsos MORI poll put it at 86%. Reporter's notebook: Interviewing the royal couple . But there's been a change in sentiment since they married. A new poll conducted by Comres for CNN found that only 35% now oppose Camilla being known as queen. Nearly one in four said they liked her more now than they did 10 years ago. This coincides with a change in palace strategy -- away from the aggressive spin machine of the 1990s to simply allowing Camilla to be herself. When she appears in public, she's either seen supporting her husband or promoting a set of causes she has a genuine connection with. Prince Charles praised how his wife has handled herself. \"She's done an enormous amount for the whole issue around osteoporosis, which of course runs in her family,\" he said, noting that Camilla's mother and grandmother both suffered from the bone disease. He also points to other issues Camilla is associated with, including literacy and preventing sexual violence. The Duchess of Cornwall, by sticking to what she knows and cares about, is able to connect with the people she meets, which doesn't always come across on camera. When Charles and Camilla married in 2005, there was huge sensitivity around the legacy of Diana, who was expected to be queen herself. With this in mind, royal aides announced that Camilla would not use the title of Queen when Charles becomes King. Instead she would be known as Princess Consort. That still stands, although the public of today looks less likely to oppose the title of Queen.","highlights":"Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, preparing for U.S. trip .\nCharles praises Camilla for how she has defined her public role .\nThe two are coming up on their 10-year wedding anniversary ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Every year, animal handlers travel throughout England and Wales to compete at agricultural shows. Jooney Woodward's \"Best in Show\" is a documentation of those competitions, with photos that place a spotlight on the handlers and their animals. \"When you go to (the shows), they tend to be all about the animals -- people photographing the animals,\" Woodward said. \"I just wanted to turn my attention onto the people because they're so committed to what they do. They're really devoted and hardworking.\" While those involved with the competitions are the focus of many press photographers, Woodward's work stands out for its distinctive portraiture style. \"My work is a bit more composed. I use a medium-format camera and a tripod, so it is a bit more static in a way,\" she said. \"I think everybody is so proud of their animals that when I said to them that, 'I'd love a portrait of you and your cow,' everyone was more than willing to give up their time and help because they're so passionate about what they do.\" The \"Best in Show\" portraits lead viewers down a winding pathway to ponder those inexplicable yet noticeable connections and bonds that exist between the handlers and their animals. Woodward's photos also contain subtle details. For example, the symbols and signs on the wall behind Wendy and her Hereford yearling heifer Mandalay Juliette are just as significant as the handler and her animal. \"It's just the way (Wendy) had gone through the effort of decorating the pen (with Union Jacks) where the cows were being kept,\" Woodward said. \"There's also a sign behind (her) ... and there's a picture of a gentleman with a cow, who is actually her husband who had died a few years ago. ... I just thought that was nice, something quite sentimental about that.\" There are not only sentimental subtleties within \"Best in Show,\" but also fun and interesting ones as well. This is especially evident in the photo of the traditional Welsh pigs being judged, as Woodward points out there is an advertisement for sausages behind the pigs. Regardless of what elements make up Woodward's photos, the emotions and aesthetics remain particularly important. Woodward said that when photographing Jamie and his Jersey cow, his happiness and smile made her want to \"share that sense of enjoyment\" that handlers have when competing with their animals in the shows. What drew Woodward to Harriet and her guinea pig Gentleman Jack were the similar colors radiating from both of them. Her photo of the pair won the National Portrait Gallery's Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait Prize in 2011. \"(Harriet) was like a steward, she was sort of judging the guinea pigs. And she also had her own guinea pig with her, which had red as well,\" Woodward said. \"I just thought that was incredibly striking. I thought, 'I've got to get a shot of that.' \" The dynamics of the competitions foster a community atmosphere in which everybody becomes acquainted with one another after having traveled to different shows for so many years. Woodward said this was an enjoyable aspect of her work because \"you get to see lots of familiar faces.\" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. She has learned about the pride the handlers have toward their animals, and many of her presumptions about the competitions have now changed after having worked on \"Best in Show.\" \"I think when I first started going, I was sort of thinking the shows would be more novelty, fun things for these people,\" she said. \"But, actually, it isn't really; it's quite a serious thing, because they can make money from breeding.\" In addition to handlers earning significant money from breeding, they are also able to achieve recognition for their livestock. Those competing have a lot at stake when they make the decision to travel and compete, because the shows are just as much business events as they are social gatherings. The competitions are also rather family-oriented, and Woodward said that while adults compete, their sons, daughters and grandchildren are involved as well. The younger generations are likely to one day take over the responsibility of running the family farms, and everyone that participates seems to have a strong sense of pride and passion for agriculture. \"I think it's something I will always document for the rest of my life, and see how things change,\" Woodward said. \"It was challenging, insightful and fun.\" Jooney Woodward is a British photographer based in London.

The midfielder is alleged to have used abusive and\/or insulting words and\/or behaviour in the tunnel after Saturday's 2-0 FA Cup quarter-final defeat to Aston Villa. Referee Anthony Taylor sent off Albion's Claudio Yacob and Villa's Jack Grealish during the game, which saw Villa progress through to the semi-finals where they will play Blackburn or Liverpool. Chris Brunt (right), pictured disputing a decision with Anthony Taylor, has been hit with an FA charge . Aston Villa fans celebrated by racing on to the pitch following their 2-0 victory over West Brom at Villa Park . Baggies boss Tony Pulis steered well clear of getting involved at Thursday's press conference ahead of their game against Stoke. 'That's with Richard (Garlick, director of football administration) and the powers that be,' he said. 'That's in the if, buts and maybes for Saturday. 'We don't know if he'll be charged or if he's banned. We're not sure yet, they're still talking.'

Pulis remained detached from all disciplinary issues on Thursday, ranging from Brunt's case to the crowd trouble and whether his winger Callum McManaman was struck in the tunnel after the game. 'That's ongoing and it's something I'm not involved in,' he said about the disturbing scenes. 'That's down to the powers-that-be who are above me. It's up to them to sort that out and we'll see where that takes us. But at the moment I don't think there's any comment from ourselves or the FA.' Police and the FA are investigating the behaviour of both club's after the unruly scenes in which some West Brom players are also alleged to have tried to trip Villa fans . Tony Pulis has called for supporters to behave themselves, or be punished properly . Pulis did, however, reiterate the need for common sense from supporters. 'You want derbies to be passionate and committed but there are certain levels, certain rules, that we should all stay and work within,' he said. 'If people have broken those rules then they should be punished and punished properly, because you can't have a situation like we've had 20 or 30 years back where it's just chaos. We've moved on as a country from that and we have to make sure we don't allow it to come back in.' As for possible lifetime bans for supporters, Pulis said: 'That's down to the club.'","highlights":"Brunt faces a charge of using insulting words in the tunnel after West Brom's defeat to Aston Villa in the FA Cup .\nVilla won a fiesty game, which saw two red cards and crowd trouble .\nBoth clubs are still waiting the results of FA and police investigations ."}
{"article":"Lance Armstrong welcomed an investigative report into the murky past of cycling's governing body and said he hopes it can help the sport move on from an era that will always be remembered for the doping by himself and others. The report turned up no evidence to sustain previous allegations that Armstrong paid the UCI (Union Cycliste Internationale) to cover up a positive doping test back in his heyday, yet it explains in great detail how the UCI acted favorably toward Armstrong - a rider dubbed 'cycling's pop star.' The Cycling Independent Reform Commission (CIRC) was requested by Brian Cookson, the current UCI president. Its report examined how the doping culture during Armstrong's era was allowed to fester under the previous UCI leadership of former president Pat McQuaid and predecessor Hein Verbruggen. Scroll down for video . Lance Armstrong pictured during his 2013 interview with Oprah where he admitted to doping.

'It is my hope that revealing the truth will lead to a bright, dope-free future for the sport I love, and will allow all young riders emerging from small towns throughout the world in years to come to chase their dreams without having to face the lose-lose choices that so many of my friends, teammates and opponents faced.' Armstrong is trying to overturn a life ban imposed by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. He was stripped of his seven Tour titles for doping on every one of his wins from 1999-2005. Armstrong's attorney, Elliot Peters, said Armstrong 'cooperated fully' with senior investigators over two days, answering all questions 'without any restrictions' and providing 'all documents requested to which he had access.' In their affidavits provided to USADA - whose scathing report in 2012 exposed systematic doping by Armstrong and others - former U.S. Postal teammates Tyler Hamilton and Floyd Landis declared that Armstrong had told them separately that he tested positive for the performance enhancer EPO at the 2001 Tour de Suisse. Landis claimed that the test was hushed up as a result of a financial agreement with Verbruggen. Armstrong was tested five times during the 2001 Tour de Suisse. Three samples were tested for EPO and they came back negative, although there was a 'strong suspicion' that two of the 'A'' samples did contain traces of the banned blood booster, the CIRC report said \u2014 adding that it deemed inappropriate the fact that 'Armstrong and his entourage were informed by the UCI of these suspect test results.' A year later, Armstrong sent Verbruggen a letter containing a check for $25,000 as a donation toward the fight against doping. Although CIRC has 'not found any indication of a financial agreement' the report said the 'UCI did not act prudently in accepting a donation from an athlete' already under suspicion.

The report\u00a0explains in great detail how the international cycling union acted favorably toward Armstrong - a rider dubbed 'cycling's pop star' The collusion between Armstrong and the UCI's leadership features strongly in the 227-page report. Armstrong's lawyers were allowed to draft parts of a supposedly independent report, which sought to debunk French daily L'Equipe's claims in 2005 that Armstrong's samples at the 1999 Tour later tested positive for EPO. The independent report into the '99 allegations, which was led by Dutch lawyer Emile Vrijman, was heavily criticized because it 'specifically excluded an examination of the EPO test,' meaning it deliberately avoided addressing whether Armstrong used the substance. The Vrijman report coincided with an agreement between Armstrong and the UCI that he would donate $100,000 for the purchase of a Sysmex blood testing machine. This prompted allegations that his latest donation to the UCI's anti-doping cause was an indirect payment to help fund the Vrijman report and quash L'Equipe's story. The CIRC did not find 'any evidence to corroborate' such allegations but said the UCI acted improperly 'in soliciting and accepting donations from an athlete' under increasing suspicion. The close-knit relationship helped Armstrong on the '99 Tour when he tested positive for a banned corticosteroid. Armstrong did not declare pre-race that he was using medication \u2014 even though the argument he used for using a corticoid cream was to treat saddle sores. Rather than start disciplinary proceedings, the UCI accepted a backdated prescription and cleared him. Armstrong, having retired after the 2005 Tour, was also cleared by the UCI to make his comeback at Australia's Tour down Under in 2009 \u2014 despite not being eligible because he had not been in the UCI's doping testing pool for a six-month period beforehand. McQuaid first wrote to Armstrong, firmly telling him he could not race. But two days after that, McQuaid informed him that he could compete. The same day, Armstrong told McQuaid that he would race in the 2009 Tour of Ireland, which McQuaid was keen to promote in his homeland. In one email sent to McQuaid, written at the time of USADA's impending investigation, a UCI consultant refers to Armstrong as 'cycling's pop star' and states clearly that for the sake of its image the 'UCI has an interest that LA is acquitted.'

{"article":"(The Hollywood Reporter)Good artists borrow. Great artists steal. On Tuesday, a California federal jury delivered its own message to artists everywhere that inspiration can rise to copyright infringement. The verdict was reached after eight days of trial testimony examining whether Robin Thicke's and Pharrell Williams' \"Blurred Lines,\" one of the most successful songs of the young century, was improperly drawn from a soulful hallmark from the prior one \u2014 Marvin Gaye's 1977 hit \"Got to Give It Up.\" Ultimately, a jury comprised of five women and three men heard dueling opinions regarding \"Blurred Lines\" and decided to order Thicke and Williams to pay $4 million in copyright damages plus profits attributable to infringement, which for Thicke was determined to be $1.8 million and for Williams was determined to be $1.6 million. Both escaped statutory damages as the infringement was found not to be willful. Read more: Robin Thicke sues to protect 'Blurred Lines' from Marvin Gaye's family (exclusive) The hardly predictable outcome over a song that made more than $16 million in profits will resonate in the music industry where copyright lawsuits are commonplace, but few such suits ever make it to trial. Most never get past the summary judgment phase because judges carefully draw the line on any lawsuits alleging misappropriation of non-protectable ideas. The highest profile disputes like the one between Tom Petty and Sam Smith over \"Stay With Me\" usually settle. Not only did the \"Blurred Lines\" case go the distance, both sides brought esteemed entertainment litigators to convince the jury. Howard King, representing Thicke, Williams and rapper T.I (a.k.a. Clifford Harris Jr.), spoke how artists need wide berth in their creative pursuits. During opening arguments, he told the jury, \"We're going to show you what you already know: that no one owns a genre or a style or a groove. To be inspired by Marvin Gaye is an honorable thing.\" Over the next week-and-a-half, King would execute a two-pronged strategy: First, he emphasized that Frankie and Nona Gaye only owned compositional elements in the \"Got to Give It Up\" sheet music, leaving out more recognizable elements of the recording like the percussion and singing. Second, he had witnesses testifying both to the differences of \"Blurred Lines\" and \"Got To Give It Up\" as well as the similarities in other famous songs. The case has been tough on Thicke thanks to depositions revealing he lied in media interviews and was drunk and high on Vicodin. But the singer attempted to do himself a favor by showcasing that songs can be stitched together with ease and that perceptions about similarity can be deceiving. On the witness stand, he sang a medley of U2's \"With Or Without You,\" The Beatles' \"Let It Be,\" Alphaville's \"Forever Young,\" Bob Marley's \"No Woman No Cry\" and Michael Jackson's \"Man In the Mirror.\" Read more: Robin Thicke admits drug abuse, lying to media in wild \"Blurred Lines\" deposition (exclusive) Williams also testified about his song creation process, admitting to jurors that \"Blurred Lines\" channels \"that '70s feeling\" and that he looked up to Gaye, but that to feel, isn't copyright infringement. \"The last thing you want to do as a creator is take something of someone else's when you love him,\" said Williams, expressing a point-of-view that's in contrast to the maxim that good artists borrow and great artists steal. Richard Busch, attorney for the Gayes, appeared to know he'd need to overcome the celebrity charisma of his counterparts. \"They will smile at you and they will be charming,\" he said in opening arguments. \"Keep one thing in mind: They are professional performers.\" Read more: 'Blurred Lines' trial--Robin Thicke performs piano medley in court . The Gaye family was handicapped by U.S. District Judge John Kronstadt's decision to preclude use at trial of the original sound recording of \"Got to Give It Up\" because Gaye's copyrights on the song were limited to the sheet music compositions. Before the trial began, Busch wondered whether his side would get a fair trial, and while the judge eventually allowed a stripped-down version of Gaye's song to be played for the jury's ears, the attorney was disturbed by comments made by the Thicke side that he argued had \"poisoned\" the trial. The judge dismissed those concerns. Any lingering unhappiness over the judge's decision leading to the jury's verdict will likely be taken on appeal. To demonstrate copyright infringement, Busch instead leaned on the musicologists, who testified of similarities in signature phrase, hook, keyboard-bass interplay, lyrics and theme of the songs. Although \"Blurred Lines\" was the headliner, the Gaye family also attempted to prove that Thicke's \"Love After War\" was an infringement of Gaye's \"After the Dance\" too. Then, there was the rare peek at \"Blurred Lines\" financial success as the Gaye family made their case for damages. Busch had accounting experts speak about all the money made \u2014 including $5.6 million in profits to Thicke, $5.2 million to Williams and $700K to T.I. and the rest of the $16.7 million in overall profits to record companies Interscope, UMG Distribution and Star Trak. The Gayes also wanted some of the $11 million in touring income attributable to \"Blurred Lines\" success as well as money for overhead costs and statutory damages for willful infringement. All told, the Gaye family was seeking more than $25 million \u2014 a mammoth demand that would shatter the song plagiarism high-water mark of $5.4 million that a California court ordered Michael Bolton and Sony to pay two decades ago for infringing The Isley Brothers' \"Love is a Wonderful Thing.\" In closing arguments, Busch raised the issue of Thicke's credibility, telling jurors, \"\"What it boils down to is 'Yes, we copied. Yes, we took it. Yes, we lied about it. Yes, we changed our story every time'... It boils down to this: Who do you believe?... Are you going to believe Robin Thicke, who told us all he's not an honest person?\" King offered a rebuttal. \"Why would Mr. Williams need to copy anyone to create a hit?\" he asked the jury. \"Why would Mr. Thicke and Mr. Williams endure a proceeding like this, where their personal financial details are revealed to the world?\" In what might now be the landmark legal controversy over songcraft, the jury decided to find that Thicke and Williams infringed both songs. The two were only punished $9,375 for \"Love After War,\" but it will be the multimillion dollar verdict regarding \"Blurred Lines\" that will sound out for ages. \u00a92015 The Hollywood Reporter.

{"article":"(CNN)Angelina Jolie's essay in the New York Times revealing that she had her ovaries and Fallopian tubes removed to lower her risk of cancer provoked an outpouring of support as the news spread across social media. Jolie, 39, wrote that she had opted for the surgery after blood tests revealed markers that might have been an indication of early cancer. Two years ago, she underwent a double mastectomy for similar reasons. Jolie's mother died of ovarian cancer, and the actress has a gene mutation that makes her chances of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer much higher than the overall population. Many were inspired by her decision and her choice to open up about the surgery. Others saw an opportunity for helping educate women and advocate for their health, a cause near and dear to Jolie's own heart. Some worried for the star, who wrote in her op-ed that \"the fact is I remain prone to cancer.\" The Internet being what it is, others took Jolie's announcement as a chance to mock.

{"article":"(CNN)Kentucky is so awesome right now you are probably watching the NCAA men's basketball tournament to see who is going to get second. The undefeated Wildcats were scary good Thursday night in crushing West Virginia. The score was so lopsided the game was over before the first television timeout. While the Wildcats won in a blowout, Notre Dame and Wisconsin also advanced to the Elite Eight with less-than-comfortable wins. The Fighting Irish pulled away from Wichita State while the Badgers shook off pesky North Carolina. During the nightcap a lot of televisions -- outside the commonwealth of Kentucky -- probably changed channels. The good news was Arizona and Xavier played a terrific game in the final contest of the night. Perhaps you shouldn't provoke the beast that is Kentucky. In the week leading up to the game, West Virginia's Daxter Miles said, \"I give them them their props. Salute them getting to 36-0. But tomorrow they're gonna be 36-1.\" Mr. Miles missed his guaranteed win by miles. The Wildcats smoked the Mountaineers 78-39 Thursday night in a Midwest Region contest that was never a contest. Kentucky raced to an 18-2 lead -- they should have stopped it then -- and had five players score in double figures on the night. Trey Lyles was the Wildcats' top scorer with 14 points. West Virginia couldn't guard anyone, except maybe the official who went down when he tripped over a Mountaineer waiting at the scoring table. Kentucky's 37-0 record is the best start in NCAA history, which has Kentucky superfan Ashley Judd super excited. It wasn't a pretty game for the Wildcats' offense, but Arizona scratched its way past Xavier 68-60 in a West Region semifinal. Arizona shot 40 percent,  while Xavier wasn't much better at 43 percent. The Wildcats tightened their defense toward the end, closing out with a 19-7 run that pushed them to a win and a meeting Saturday with Wisconsin. It's a rematch of an Elite 8 game last year, which the Badgers won by one point. T.J. McConnell topped all Arizona scorers with 17 points while Matt Stainbrook led Xavier with 17 points. The Irish found the right balance in the second half, putting the Shockers away for a 81-70 victory in the Midwest Region. Notre Dame trailed by 1 with 16:43 left when it went on a spurt that saw six different players score as the lead grew to double digits. Demetrius Jackson, who started the run with back-to-back three-pointers, led the Irish with 20 points. Two-sport star Pat Connaughton had 16. Steve Vasturia, who one CBS analyst called a baby-faced assassin, chipped in 13 points. Jerian Grant, a national player of the year candidate, had a rough night shooting, so he set up his teammates for buckets instead. He had nine points but 11 assists. Junior Fred VanVleet led the Shockers with 25 points while Darius Carter maneuvered inside for 22. Wisconsin played cool and shot hot from the free-throw line in holding off North Carolina 79-72. Sam Decker was trending on Twitter but the Tar Heels were concerned about Sam Dekker (two Ks, folks!), the Wisconsin forward who wasn't having any trouble scoring against the fourth-seeded Tar Heels. Dekker, who was guarded by the Heels' best defender, J.P. Tokoto, sliced his way for 15 first-half points to keep the Badgers in the game. The junior had a career-high 23 points on the night while Frank Kaminsky, one of the best players in the country, struggled. But the 7-foot tall center hit a big three and big free throws as the minutes wound down. The Badgers were 20 for 23 from the free throw line. Kaminsky hit all eight of his attempts. Folks also got worked up over seeing Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and actress girlfriend Olivia Munn at the game. Seems like TBS cut to a shot of the two at every break in the action. How'd you like to be the guy next to Rodgers? He won two U.S. Open golf titles, yet isn't famous enough to get all the way in the celebrity fan shot. It's OK, Andy North.","highlights":"Kentucky destroys West Virginia .\nNotre Dame's offense gets hot in the second half, led by Demetrius Jackson .\nWisconsin holds off ACC's North Carolina with superb free-throw shooting ."}
{"article":"Lizzie Velasquez, pictured with documentary director\u00a0Sara Hirsh Bordo arrive, at the premiere of\u00a0'A Brave Heart: The Lizzie Velasquez Story' today . Lizzie Velasquez has known the torment of being mocked by bullies from around the world. As a 17-year-old surfing the web, she came across a video of herself on YouTube that described her as the 'world's ugliest woman'. The devastated teenager spent days shutting herself from the world behind a wall of tears, thinking her life was over. But now 26, the inspirational woman has hit back at the trolls with an anti-bullying documentary about her life, describing her battle with a rare condition which stops her putting on weight. 'A Brave Heart: The Lizzie Velasquez Story' premiers at the South by Southwest Film Festival in Austin, Texas, today. The 78-minute film charts Lizzie's inspiring path from cyber-bullying victim to anti-bullying activist. Featuring details of Lizzie's emotional and physical journey through the years, it follows her progress as she attempts to lobby the US government for the first federal anti-bullying Bill. She was born with Marfan syndrome and lipodystrophy, which is a problem with the way fat is distributed in the body. At only 5ft 2ins tall, Lizzie only weighs 58lbs - just over four stone. 'All we had known all my life was that I had a syndrome which meant that I couldn't gain weight. 'At the time, I thought everyone looked like me. I didn't recognise or tell that they didn't look like me.' Lizzie, born with a rare condition which prevents her from gaining weight, was tormented by bullies at school but was shocked to discover thousands of cruel comments on a YouTube video of her at the age of 17 . First bullied as a child in school for looking different, she was horrified to stumble across a YouTube video labeling her 'The World's Ugliest Woman' as a teenager. The video, viewed four million times, was accompanied by a cascade of cruel comments about her appearance - and suggestions that she should have killed at birth. 'It was afternoon. I decided to go look for music on YouTube - and that's when I found it,' she said. 'I don't even know why I clicked on it but I did and that's when I lost it. Speaking ahead of her documentary's showing today, Lizzie said: 'I'm so excited, I can't even tell you' 'Calling me a monster or asking why my parents didn't abort me... how in the world can I forgive the people who told me to kill myself?' She fought back by giving a TED Talk in 2013 which she says 'changed everything'. 'This is my purpose. This is what I'm meant to do for the rest of my life. 'I like to think that I'm not only telling my story, I'm telling everyone's story.' Now, Lizzie's own\u00a0YouTube channel, which boasts more than 300,000 subscribers. Speaking in a video posted to her channel ahead of her documentary's showing today, she said: 'I'm so excited, I can't even tell you. 'I finally was able to sleep and I'm feeling rested and ready to go.' But the inspiring 26-year-old fought back by becoming a motivational speaker and anti-bullying activist . Director Sara Hirsh Bordo said: 'Bullying is a subject that historically yields heartbreaking stories of hopelessness and in many times, loss. 'Rarely is there a story of survival and inspiration that continues to crossover ages, genders, and ethnicities\u2026 enter the brave story of Lizzie Velasquez.' The pair met when Ms Bordo asked her to give the TED Talk, which attracted more than 10million viewers. 'She was a local hero whose time, we found out shortly after, had arrived,' she added. 'We live in a culture of tremendous meanness. And few people have experienced it more than Lizzie. 'Lizzie chose to not give up, but to forgive and to thrive; as an author, as a speaker, and now as an activist.' She added: 'What I wanted to show is that this is Lizzie\u2019s film, but it is everyone\u2019s story.' Marfan Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body\u2019s connective tissue, which hold the body\u2019s cells and organs together. Connective tissue\u00a0also plays an important role in helping the body grow and develop properly. Marfan affects about one in 5,000 people - and can affect men and women of all races and ethnic groups. Three-quarters of those who have it inherit it - and there is a 50% chance that someone with Marfan syndrome will pass along the genetic mutation each time they have a child. But some are the first in their family to have it, which is called spontaneous mutation when it happens. People with Marfan syndrome are born with it, but features of the disorder are not always present immediately. Some features of Marfan syndrome, including those affecting the heart and blood vessels, bones or joints, can get worse over time. This means it is important for early diagnosis and treatment in order to avoid the risk for potentially life-threatening complications.

{"article":"(CNN)The reported kidnapping of a Vallejo, California, woman for ransom this week was nothing but a hoax, police said. Vallejo police Lt. Kenny Park went as far as to call it a \"wild goose chase\" that wasted department resources. Denise Huskins and her boyfriend Aaron Quinn, who reported the kidnapping Monday, are no longer cooperating with police, Park said. Huskins was found safe on Wednesday, more than 400 miles away in Huntington Beach. Officers from the Huntington Beach Police Department talked with Huskins, 29, at her father's apartment complex, department spokeswoman Jennifer Marlatt told reporters. The case has authorities scratching their heads. Huskins initially indicated she would be happy to talk with Vallejo police and provide details of what happened, according to Park. Anxious to talk with her, Vallejo police and the FBI sent a jet to Huntington Beach to fly her back to the Bay Area. When it was time to go, Huskins was a no show. \"As of right now, we have not heard from Miss Huskins and we are no longer in contact with any of the family members,\" Park said late Wednesday.  The family has retained an attorney. Like Huskins, Quinn isn't talking. Charges are possible in the case, Park said, but those will be decided by the district attorney once the investigation is complete. The quickly changing developments left authorities frustrated. Quinn called on Monday afternoon to report that his girlfriend had been kidnapped several hours earlier from his home. At the time, Park said that the case was being treated as a kidnap for ransom. Huskins' father, Michael, made an emotional appeal through CNN affiliate KGO-TV in San Francisco directed at the kidnappers: \"Don't hurt her, please don't hurt her.\" \"The biggest fear is the horror she might be going through ... that's my biggest fear. The horror, she doesn't deserve that, not from anybody.\" \"It's like a nightmare that I can't wake up from,\" her father told the affiliate. \"This is not supposed to happen.\" Then, the San Franciso Chronicle posted an audio clip.  On it, a woman who identified herself as Denise Huskins says she has been abducted. \"My name is Denise Huskins. I am kidnapped, otherwise I'm fine,\" the voice says. \"Earlier today there was a plane crash in Alps and 158 people died. And one thing that people know about me is that I went to my first concert, me and my mom, to Blink 182 (last word is inaudible).\" The editor in chief of the Chronicle, Audrey Cooper, said the newspaper received a link to the audio file in an email. The Chronicle reported the anonymous email said Huskins would be \"returned safely (Wednesday). We will send a link to her location after she has been dropped off. She will be in good health and safe while she waits. Any advance on us or our associates will create a dangerous situation for Denise. Wait until she is recovered and then proceed how you will. We will be ready.\" Then came Wednesday. The Chronicle reported that Huskins' father said he received a voice mail from his daughter saying she had been dropped off at his apartment. He called police to ask that the authorities pick her up and make sure she was safe, he told the newspaper. \"I almost had a heart attack,\" he said, according to the Chronicle. \"I tried to get authorities to pick her up, but they kept asking me a bunch of questions. I said, 'Send a squad car.' I was hyperventilating.\" Authorities are unclear what exactly is going on. Or , if they know, they're not saying. Police said the requested ransom amount was $8,500.  The FBI is investigating the Huskins' financial records. About 40 detectives from various agencies and 100 support personnel \"worked around the clock\" on the case, leaving the community on edge, Park said. \"I can tell you that our investigation has concluded that none of the claims has been substantiated,\" he said. \"And I can go one step further to say this:  That this was not a random act and that the members of our community are safe and that they have nothing to fear.\" \"It's disappointing. It's disheartening,\" he said. CNN's Dan Simon, Tony Marco, Faith Karimi, Ashley Fantz, Elan Bird, Michael Martinez, Stella Chan, Rosalina Nieves and Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.","highlights":"Police call the case a hoax, a \"wild goose chase\"\nAbductors seized Denise Huskins on Monday, her boyfriend told authorities ."}
{"article":"Nemanja Matic returns to the Chelsea team after serving a two-match ban in domestic football and Jose Mourinho admits the club has learned valuable lessons from the way he was allowed to leave for Benfica. Matic has become arguably the most important player in Mourinho's team, providing the midfield security and physical presence which allows others the freedom to create. The Chelsea boss insisted he would 'never' have allowed the Serb to leave Stamford Bridge but understands how it happened and applauded the board for showing the courage to sign him again for \u00a322million, three years after he joined Benfica as a makeweight in a deal to sign David Luiz. Jose Mourinho believes Chelsea were 'brave' in deciding to bring Nemanja Matic back to Stamford Bridge . Matic has become an important member of Chelsea's first team since rejoining Chelsea . The 28-year-old has missed Chelsea's last two games against Tottenham and West Ham due to suspension . 'Chelsea were brave by bringing him back,' said Mourinho. 'If in this world you want to do the best for your club you don't protect yourself from possible critics. You simply do what you think is the best. 'We wanted a midfield player and we had on the table three or four but the best one he was a former Chelsea player. I don't say a player they lost but they were brave to say we are sure this is the right one, we are sure he is the best one, we are sure he is going to be a success here. 'Probably the next time Chelsea does a deal with a young player they will keep control. At these ages, the evolution of players can be good or bad. You can loan or even sell a player but you have ways of being in control of his future. 'Another aspect is the fact that Chelsea had so many managers in these years. It is difficult for the business people on the board. For one manager, Matic is the right profile of player, another one thinks Matic can go because I don't like him. This guy I like because he is fast, this guy I don't like because he is small. 'With a philosophy on the table, it is much easier for our board. If I was here, a left-footed player, 1.95 metres tall, would never, never, never leave. Never.' Matic was handed a two-match suspension for pushing Burnley's Ashley Barnes . Mourinho insists Matic wouldn't have been sold if he was in charge during the midfielder's first Chelsea spell . Matic was sent off against Burnley last month for a retaliatory push on Ashley Barnes and missed the Capital One Cup final against Tottenham and a London derby at West Ham, when young centre-half Kurt Zouma deputised in midfield. He returns to the team for the Champions League last-16 tie against PSG at Stamford Bridge, which is poised at 1-1 after the first leg in France. 'It is goof to have him back with we did well without him,' said Mourinho. 'So I've told him maybe he is not so important. It was a bit of a joke and he laughed, but I told him we won a final and beat West Ham at West Ham, so we did well without him. 'But he is important, of course he is. He is very important in the balance of our team. Our team was developed with Matic in that position and everybody feels comfortable with him there. 'Zouma did amazingly well for us in those two games, in that position, but Zouma is a central defender and will always sbe a central defender, while Matic is Matic and the team feels very good with him.'","highlights":"Nemanja Matic was used as makeweight in David Luiz's move to Chelsea .\nSerbian international Matic rejoined Chelsea from Benfica in January 2014 .\nChelsea boss Jose Mourinho said Matic was one of 'three or four' options ."}
{"article":"Hong Kong (CNN)Nestled in a tranquil hillside, Hong Kong's newest Buddhist monastery features bulletproof VIP rooms and the world's second tallest statue of the Goddess of Mercy -- a Buddhist deity. The monastery is funded entirely by Asia's richest man, Li Ka-shing, who contributed $193 million from his personal foundation to the building project. The premises, styled on Tang dynasty buildings, sprawl across a lush, green area of 500,000 square feet - around nine football fields. It can accommodate up to 400 to 500 visitors daily, but will not be open to tour groups in order to preserve the sacred atmosphere. Li initiated the project in 2003 to promote Buddhism in the city and construction took five years to complete. At a height of 76 meters (250 feet), the Goddess of Mercy statue overlooks the site and a breathtaking view of Hong Kong's harbor and several islands. The monastery also features several grand halls, including one which houses three ornate 24-karat gold plated Buddhist statues, where people can meditate, and learn about Buddhism. But perhaps the most intriguing feature is the bulletproof dormitory rooms. One of the three dormitories that provide housing for visiting monks from all over world has built-in bulletproof windows to protect \"important guests.\" \"We installed the bulletproof glass windows because we hoped there could be a place to protect our important guests such as the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand and other top monks,\" Walter Ngai Kai-shu, secretary general of the monastery told local media. The rooms are still empty, and Ngai added that they were not designed for Li or any specific individual, reported the South China Morning Post. Visitors are not allowed to bring joss sticks, meat, alcohol, or other food offerings in order to be environmentally friendly --- instead the monastery will provide water. \"There are many other ways to offer the Buddha apart from joss sticks,\" Ngai told local media. Currently, a dozen monks, mainly from Hong Kong and Southeast Asia reside inside the monastery. It will be open to the public on April 15, but registration and booking is now available online. CNN's Shen Lu contributed to this report.","highlights":"Hong Kong's newest monastery features bulletproof VIP rooms and the world's second tallest Goddess of Mercy statue .\nThe $193M monastery is funded by Asia's richest man, Li Ka-shing .\nThe monastery will be open to public by mid April ."}

{"article":"Inevitably, it all kicked off in the end. Three games in two competitions over 10 days has forged some barely disguised contempt between Celtic and Dundee United. Six red cards tell their own tale. For Jackie McNamara\u2019s team, the frustration \u2014 and indiscipline \u2014 is growing. Ryan McGowan became the fourth United player to see red in the dying minutes, seconds after Celtic\u2019s Anthony Stokes was dismissed for a retaliatory kick at Paul Paton. Afterwards, Ronny Deila rounded on the Australian, claiming he could have injured substitute Liam Henderson \u2018for life\u2019. The open wounds enveloping this fixture are now there for all to see.

Sent off: McGowan . Booked: Cierzniak, Rankin, Ciftci . Referee: Calum Murray . It is hard to see who will stop Scotland\u2019s champions now. United will have a fourth attempt in the SPFL Premiership this weekend. Yet after losing the League Cup Final and crashing out of the Scottish Cup in this quarter-final replay, that prospect holds all the appeal of a cold-meat buffet with Jeremy Clarkson. Inverness Caley Thistle will make all the right noises before a Scottish Cup semi-final at Hampden. Aberdeen believe their title aspirations are alive and well. Yet, Celtic are developing a habit of wrapping themselves around opponents and squeezing tight. For Deila, the fourth domestic Treble in this old club\u2019s history is edging over the horizon. Jason Denayer\u2019s 17th-minute headed goal was the platform for Leigh Griffiths to add a second on 57 minutes. Kris Commons thrashed the third high into the net 12 minutes from time before Virgil van Dijk tapped in from close range in the final moments. By then, things threatened to run out of control. Stokes had taken a kick at Paton and witnessed the flash of red. The crowd bayed for retribution against McGowan seconds later and were duly obliged by referee Calum Murray. In a freakish run of three consecutive meetings, United have now scored one, losing six. They return to Glasgow at the weekend a punch-drunk team blighted by suspensions, with former players Stuart Arsmtrong, Gary Mackay-Steven likely to return to the Celtic fray. It\u2019s hardly a prospect to savour. Deila\u2019s team began the game with a flourish and kept going. Nadir Ciftci, the United striker spared further punishment for a kick to the face of Scott Brown in the first game, felt the Celtic skipper\u2019s robust retribution in all of six seconds. It was a forerunner for what was to come. For one heart-stopping moment in only the second minute, the visitors feared they might witness their latest red card in this fixture when keeper Radoslaw Cierzniak raced from his line to clatter Griffiths as he hared on to a superb Commons through ball. Griffiths had already lost control, the goalscoring opportunity gone. Referee Murray \u2014 rightly \u2014 contented himself with a yellow card. He would have the chance to flex his muscles later. Jason Denayer (centre) rises above the Dundee United defence to score the opener for the hosts . Denayer celebrates after putting Celtic 1-0 up in the Scottish Cup quarter-final . McNamara reshaped his defence in the absence of suspended duo Paul Dixon and Sean Dillon, fielding midfielder John Rankin as a makeshift, emergency left-back. The midfielder suffered a form of torture here. It made for painful viewing. James Forrest \u2014 finally free of injury and a scorer in last Sunday\u2019s League Cup triumph \u2014 used his pace to offer Celtic width and speed. Even so, the home team had just one goal to show for 45 minutes of dominance at the interval. It came from a Calum Butcher foul on Commons midway inside the United half. Stokes \u2014 an improved performer since his recent disciplinary faux pas \u2014 floated the ball into a crowded area, Denayer planting a firm, looping header beyond Cierzniak for his fifth of the season. At Hampden, Celtic were loathe to build on their lead and possession. So it was here again. They had the chances. A Commons corner picked out van Dijk, the Dutchman\u2019s firm header surging over the bar. Celtic's Leigh Griffiths (right) is airborne as he puts his side 2-0 in front against Dundee United . Griffiths gives a salute as he slides across the Celtic Park pitch in celebration . Taunting and tormenting Rankin, Forrest then came close to scoring by accident. Putting his head down and surging for the byeline, his attempted cross dropped under the bar and was heading into the net until Cierzniak tipped over at the last. Another opportunity was passed up before half-time, a sclaffed Cierzniak kick out to Nir Bitton prompting a rare loss of composure in the usually unflappable Israeli. He had the chance to shoot, but opted to take on Callum Morris instead and lost the ball. United\u2019s resistance was sporadic. They came close in 32 minutes after an outstanding incursion down the right flank by McGowan. The Australian made it unchecked from his own half to the Celtic byeline, his low centre aimed at Ciftci before Celtic keeper Craig Gordon managed \u2014 unconvincingly \u2014 to get a hand on the ball. Kris Commons (second left) scores Celtic's third goal of the evening at their home ground . Commons celebrates as Celtic go three up against Dundee United in the cup . Efe Ambrose, in that way of his, casually walked the ball clear from under his own crossbar. Celtic then began the second period in a ragged, loose fashion and that allowed the visitors their best spell of the game. In the opening five minutes, United summoned more attacking menace than they had managed in the entire first 45. Ciftci\u2019s low, right-foot shot was pushed up in the air by Gordon as he retrieved another piercing ball across the face of goal from McGowan. But it didn\u2019t last long. Until the 57th minute to be precise. Celtic scored with virtually their first effort on goal in the second period, Griffiths cleverly guiding a quite superb long ball from Brown past Cierzniak with a first-time effort from 12 yards. The outcome was placed beyond doubt 11 minutes from time. Commons blew a fine chance after a flowing passing move involving Darnell Fisher, Bitton and a Stokes cut-back.

But within seconds he atoned, playing a deft one-two with substitute John Guidetti before slamming the ball high into the net for 3-0. What came next was regrettable, but predictable. Two teams sick of the sight of each other began settling scores. Stokes took a blow to the mouth, drawing blood, and the Irishman took swift revenge as he lay on the deck. Off he went. Within moments, the scores were evened up when McGowan\u2019s crude lunge at substitute Henderson sparked a melee at the corner flag. The former Hearts player went off after what Deila described as a \u2018stupid\u2019 challenge \u2014 with some verbals between the two as he left the pitch. And Deila\u2019s players had the last word when van Dijk tapped in Denayer\u2019s simple cut back from close range.","highlights":"Celtic comfortably progressed to the William Hill Scottish Cup semi-finals .\nJason Denayer, Leigh Griffiths, Kris Commons and Virgil van Dijk all scored for the hosts at Celtic Park .\nBoth sides ended with 10 men as Anthony Stokes and Ryan McGowan were sent off ."}

{"article":"(CNN)For years, they've wanted six seasons and a movie, and at 3:01 a.m. ET Tuesday, fans got it ... almost. There's no movie yet, but \"Community's\" much-awaited sixth season made its debut. Not even cancellation by NBC could kill the fan favorite sitcom, as Yahoo streamed the first two episodes of the new season early Tuesday. The show appears to have suffered no decline in quality in the move to Yahoo, though cast member Yvette Nicole Brown (now on CBS' \"The Odd Couple\") had to leave the show for family reasons. The premiere briefly touches on this in its own way, with Shirley's absence sounding a lot like the setup for a spinoff (as the character Abed points out, along with several other inconsistencies throughout the episode). The \"new Shirley,\" as Dean joked, is Paget Brewster's Frankie, who exists to play the disapproving authority figure to antagonize the former study group. Soon, the group was running a Prohibition-esque bar before they could learn to live with Frankie. And how about the end of the first episode, which gave us a look at the spinoff, \"The Butcher and the Baker,\" with Shirley and Steven Weber as a Southern lawyer? Episode two got even more out there, with Dean Pelton's adventures in 1990s-style virtual reality and a less-successful plotline involving Britta's parents. Most interesting was the introduction of Keith David as '90s tech genius Elroy. Critics praised the show, with The Hollywood Reporter's Amy Amatangelo saying, \"Everything fans loved about Community remains -- the first two episodes are chock-full of increasingly bizarre pop-culture references (Portuguese Gremlins, anyone?) and meta commentary. The show has seamlessly transferred to an online venue.\" Time's James Poniewozik also liked it (despite some reservations about the plot), writing, \"The first thing that matters is if the latest reboot still has the comedy goods, and it does.\" Soon after the show went online, devoted fans on Twitter had their say.","highlights":"The fan favorite comedy \"Community\" returns for a sixth season on Yahoo .\nThe series is just as weirdly hilarious as ever, with surprises in store .\nCritics and fans loved the premiere ."}
{"article":"(CNN)\"Every day, we cried\" -- these were the words spoken over and over to me by a colleagues as we sat down after another long day for a rare drink in Monrovia, Liberia's bustling capital. She was reminiscing about the period in September and October when the Ebola outbreak was at its peak. \"Of all the pain that we faced, the cremation was the hardest,\" she explained. I knew exactly what she meant -- cremation was as far away from the norm for burials in West Africa as one can imagine. As the Ebola outbreak wanes in Liberia, it is easy to imagine the heroes as the myriad of foreign doctors, nurses, epidemiologists and logisticians that have come to support the country in their days of need, and yes, these expatriates have definitely brought to bear much knowledge, expertise and resources on controlling the outbreak. But there is a group of heroes who are unlikely to make any headlines or be celebrated as such. They are the thousands of Liberian citizens that have gone door-to-door asking questions, looking for the ill, offering advice, day after day, after day for months on end. When they do find an ill person who may have Ebola, they begin the painful process of convincing them that it is safer to be an Ebola treatment unit than at home. Often the question that follows is: \"What happened to all those that went in before me? What happened to them?\" Thankfully, Liberia appears to be on its way back. It currently has the lowest numbers of confirmed cases of Ebola since the onset of the second phase of the outbreak in the middle of last year. The streets are full of activity and schools have reopened. Across the country, there is an unmistakable sense that people are desperate to get on with their lives. At the Grand Royal Hotel, on Tubman Avenue, the main road through Monrovia, the manager sits in the popular caf\u00e9 in the front garden. Most of his guests are still members of the large contingent of development workers from all over the world, or members of the armed forces and police services that form part of the U.N. military mission in Liberia, UNMIL. He admits that while this has been good for business, he would rather have his \"normal\" clients back. Monrovia is an interesting place -- it feels very West African. The food is familiar -- fish, plantain, rice... with lots of red pepper. The power situation is still very poor and most people in Monrovia rely on generators. It has a lovely but underutilized beach front; the perfect setting for a cold bottle of \"Club\" lager in the evening. There are quite a few restaurants and supermarkets -- mostly run by Lebanese entrepreneurs. As we drive past the Presidential \"mansion\" -- I ask why it looks empty and I am told that there was a fire in it a few years ago and that the renovation is not yet complete. President Sirleaf uses the office of the Foreign Ministry, and otherwise lives in her private residence, I am told. From the outside, with all the horror stories of Ebola in the popular press, it is easy to imagine Liberia as a country on the brink, especially with its history of protracted conflicts and civil war. But there is nothing further from the truth. Yes, it was ill prepared for an outbreak of this severity and magnitude, as many other countries would have been, but sometimes there is nothing as powerful as grief to unite people in seeking a better future. Out of this crisis, must emerge a new country. While the stories of dictators, civil war and Ebola are true, they cannot be Liberia's \"single\" story. With a beautiful beach front right at the heart of the city, there is no reason for Monrovia not to be the favorite destination of West Africa's emerging middle class. With lots of mineral resources, Liberia has so much potential. But, its most obvious resource and probably its most underutilized are its human resources. The University of Liberia is one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in West Africa, but has known better times. The government of Liberia needs to think strategically and creatively on how to channel the goodwill of the world and the determination of its people into programs and projects that will put Liberia on a new trajectory. It may be impossible to imagine in 2015, but one only needs to look east to Rwanda for how a country can emerge from the most tragic of circumstances to become a proud and resilient country. Liberia will be back, but it will take leadership and courage. Despite the long hours of work, the tedious meetings, the long nights writing reports and re-strategizing, my best memories of Monrovia will be good ones; of a beautiful county and a resilient people.

{"article":"(CNN)The campaign to retake the city of Tikrit from ISIS, also known as the Islamic State, involves a curious mixture of Iraqi forces -- the army and air force, federal police, powerful Shia militia  as well as Sunni tribal fighters. It's a cast of about 30,000 fighters with an opaque command structure. And that makes it tough to be precise about numbers -- but by several estimates only one-third of those fighters are from the regular army. A CNN team that's seen the offensive at close quarters noted that Iraqi army commanders appeared to be taking a subordinate role to leaders of the Shia militia, notably Hadi al Ameri, leader of the Badr Organization. Iranian military advisers are on hand, and highly influential on the battlefield. As ISIS fighters in the area probably number in the low thousands, it might seem odd that the Iraqi army is unable to take them on alone. After all, the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) received $20 billion of U.S. money between 2005 and 2012 -- for equipment, bases and training. So just why are the ISF incapable of reclaiming territory seized by ISIS? And how long will it be before they can stand on their own feet? The answers go back to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003; Iraq's military is starting over -- for the second or third time in a decade. One of the most controversial acts of the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority, which ran Iraq following the ouster of Saddam Hussein, was to disband the Iraqi army. The decision, taken in May 2003, \"immediately created a large pool of unemployed and armed men who felt humiliated and hostile to the U.S. occupiers,\" as James P. Pfiffner put it in 2010. President George W. Bush told his biographer Robert Draper in 2006: \"The policy had been to keep the [Iraqi] army intact; didn't happen.\" The reasons have been disputed ever since. In some places there were riots among demobilized soldiers; at the same time training of Iraqi police was a desperately slow process because of the rapidly growing insurgency. In 2004, as in 2014, the security forces buckled as a Sunni insurgency spread through northern and western Iraq. Billions of dollars were spent creating a new Iraqi army from scratch. But it took two years to build a force of just 40,000 men in three light infantry divisions, so unofficial sectarian militia filled the vacuum -- militia that never quite went away. Over a seven-year period, more than $4 billion was spent on renovating and building Iraqi bases. Logistical and maintenance support: $2.6 billion. Supply of equipment: $3.4 billion (in addition to what the Iraqis bought themselves.) Training and staffing the Iraqi police: a cool $9.4 billion. With U.S. assistance and the \"Sons of Iraq\" program to coax Sunni tribes into fighting al Qaeda in Iraq, violence did diminish in 2009 and 2010. But once U.S. forces left at the end of 2011, and with them intelligence-gathering and training programs, things began to unravel. By then, the Iraqi security forces in their many guises had become an unwieldy machine that was more a welfare program than a fighting force -- providing wages to soldiers who lacked motivation and were frequently absent from duty. The only effective units were special forces such as the Golden Division. Sophisticated U.S. equipment, such as M-1 Abrams battle tanks, was not maintained. Corruption was rife -- and political interference in the military grew exponentially. As then Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki tightened his grip on power between 2006 and 2013, the high command of the Iraqi military became a political football -- with loyalty to al-Maliki prized above competence. He bypassed the defense and interior ministries and used elite units to pursue political enemies. The Institute for the Study of War reported in 2013, \"the lack of oversight on military appointments has allowed al-Maliki to choose his preferred officers (nearly all Shia) to head the most significant command positions in Iraq.\" Al-Maliki also began integrating Shia militia into army units. At the same time, the phenomenon of \"ghost soldiers\" went unchecked -- men who were either dead or AWOL but whose wages were still being paid, often to corrupt commanders. So the army, in numbers, looked much stronger than it was. In fact, by the time ISIS rolled south, the effective fighting force was less than a quarter of its peak strength of 400,000. Nearly half the army -- four divisions -- collapsed in short order as ISIS fighters stormed south from Syria in the early summer of 2014. ISIS used speed, discipline and ruthlessness in equal measure -- attributes the Iraqi army didn't have. It had also cultivated allies among members of Sunni tribes ready to act as a fifth column, and its fearsome reputation for wholesale executions of prisoners led many soldiers to strip off their uniforms and flee. The desperate situation in the summer of 2014 and an imminent threat to Shia shrines in Samarra prompted a rapid mobilization of Shia militia that had already been active around the elections -- including the Badr Organization and the Asaib Ahl al-Haq. Some members of these militia had gained combat experience fighting for the al-Assad regime in Syria. In June, the most respected religious authority among Iraqi Shi'ites, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, appealed to Iraqis to mobilize against the enemy.  The call was directed at and answered by hundreds of thousands of Shia, determined to protect gains made since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's Baathist regime. The militia -- called al Hashed al Shabi or Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) -- were trained, equipped and most importantly led by Iranian military advisers and quickly became battle hardened. What they lacked in military skills, they made up for in determination. The Iranians have invested heavily in the PMUs. The commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Quds Force, Gen. Qassim Suleimani, seems to have spent more time in Iraq than Iran since last summer and has been photographed around Tikrit. According to several analysts, it is Suleimani that has been organizing and directing the Shia militia in what appears to have been a more deliberate and better planned assault than previous operations. Christopher Harmer of the Institute for the Study of War says the role of both the Iranians and the Shia militia are evidence of the enduring weakness of the ISF. And he says that \"if the Tikrit operation is successful it presents a lot of problems for the Iraqi government's legitimacy -- somewhere down the road the Iranians and the PMU are going to demand payback.\" The role of Suleimani and al Quds -- a foreign terrorist organization in Washington's view -- means that US airpower has not been made available. \"The U.S. may not like Iranian influence in Iraq,\" says Harmer, \"but what it absolutely cannot do is provide direct support to an Iranian-led military operation.\" The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, alluded to the dilemma when in Baghdad on Monday. \"What I'm trying to sort out, actually, is the degree to which their near-term embrace of the assistance they're receiving from Iran is a reaction to the existential threat [posed by ISIS], or whether it is something longer-term,\" he said. Soon after taking office, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al Abadi fired 26 commanders and pushed 10 others into retirement.\u202fAt the time a statement on his website stressed \"the need to restore confidence in the security forces through real action and by combating corruption at the individual and institutional levels.\" U.S.-led efforts to train a new Iraqi army designed to defeat ISIS are well underway. The aim is to stand up 12 brigades each of about 5,000 troops -- including three brigades of Kurdish peshmerga. These should be ready for operations by the end of this year; the first brigade has already completed basic training. But as Harmer notes, \"the Iraqi Security Forces are yet to go head-to-head with ISIS and win without help from the PMUs. ISIS is demonstrably more capable than the ISF.\" Clearing ISIS from well-entrenched defenses around Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, seems well beyond the army's capability. In November, Gen. Dempsey said that roughly 80,000 effective troops would be needed in any attempt to win the city. That's problematic for several reasons. Kurdish officials told CNN last month that the longer the battle for Mosul is delayed, the tougher it will be. They claim that they cannot maintain the siege of the city on three sides indefinitely. The Iraqi government is under political pressure to reclaim the city and re-establish its authority there. But above all, the need for Shia militia outside the direct control of the government to help retake largely Sunni cities is fraught with peril. Human Rights Watch has already cataloged incidents of sectarian retaliation against Sunni communities by the militia. Tikrit is an especially sensitive area: in June last year, ISIS massacred by its own account as many as 1,600 air force cadets, the vast majority Shia, at Camp Speicher. Some families of the murdered recruits, and a few survivors, have claimed local Sunni tribes may have helped ISIS or even handed over the recruits after promising them safe passage. HRW Middle East Deputy Director Joe Stork says that \"past fighting raises grave concerns that Tikrit's civilians are at serious risk from both ISIS and government forces, and both sides need to protect civilians from more sectarian slaughter.\" Tit-for-tat atrocities are fuelled by a stream of social media videos showing abuses committed by all sides. ISIS' use of children: Propaganda and military training . During the Tikrit operation, both Prime Minister al Abadi and Hadi al Ameri of the Badr Organization have publicly called for civilians to be spared and human rights to be respected. Only when the city is taken, will we know whether their appeals were heeded. Harmer says he believes a majority of Iraqis want to see their country survive; far fewer want a return to sectarian conflict akin to civil war. But it remains a possibility. One of the greatest challenges -- politically -- will be to absorb the Shiite militia and Sunni tribal brigades into the Iraqi Security Forces, rather than have them operate as independent armies. They are meant to constitute a new National Guard, but the mechanics and timing remain problematic. The leaders of these militia have tasted power; their men have shed blood. They are not going to just hand over the reins -- even if and when ISIS are beaten. And they won't have to fear a strong army for a long time to come. CNN's Ben Wedeman and Kareem Khadder contributed to this story.","highlights":"Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) received $20 billion of U.S. money between 2005 and 2012 .\nIraq's military is starting over -- for the second or third time in a decade ."}

Jose Mourinho's side have let leads slip in no less than 10 games in all compeitions this season . Problems seemed to kick in after the draw against Sunday's opponents Southampton, at St Mary's, on 28 December. It was a day when Mourinho fumed about penalties not awarded and a 'campaign' against his team. Maybe the Chelsea manager had already detected signs of what might lie ahead. 2014-15: P43 W29 D11 L3 . Before Jan: P28 W21 D6 L1 . Since Jan: P15 W8 D5 L2 . Games are more difficult after the New Year, with Capital One Cup semi-finals and a final and the first knock-out round of the Champions League. Fatigue starts to bite with a manager with a small core of players he seems happy to use, which don't include Filipe Luis or Lois Remy. Yet it is Chelsea's inability to close out many games which will trouble Mourinho. His teams have consistently boasted this quality, and it remains. They closed out the Capital One Cup final against Spurs expertly, but seven times in 15 games since the turn of the year they have let a lead slip.

Diego Costa fronts up to Pablo Zabaleta at the Etihad, with Schalke celebrating in front of Fabregas . It might be more likely to develop into a battle if Manchester City were not misfiring, too. Arsenal and Liverpool are in more fluent form but a little further adrift. Too far adrift. Chelsea are not about to implode spectacularly. PSG h (CL) led twice 2-2 AET . Burnley h (PL) led 1-1. PSG a (CL) led 1-1. Man City\u00a0h (PL) led 1-1. Bradford h (FAC) led 2-0 lost 2-4. Liverpool a (C1C) led 1-1. Spurs a (PL) led 1-0 lost 3-5. Man United a (PL) led drew 1-1. Man City a (PL) led drew 1-1. Schalke h (CL) led drew 1-1 . Over the campaign, they have been easily the best in the Premier League. They will probably win the title. Rather, tiny problems have cropped up where there were none. If nothing else, it will keep Mourinho busy in the summer, in his restless quest for perfection. He will prioritise another central defender, with Raphael Varane top of the list, and will work to tighten up a defence which has shown tiny uncharacteristic flaws. Opposing teams will have noted how Thibaut Courtois, amid a brilliant season, has had issues with crosses whipped in, six yards from goal. Both PSG goals were headed in from this region. So was Burnley's equaliser. And Manchester City's equaliser came after he was beaten in such a duel by James Milner. Thibaut Courtois has started to struggle to deal with crosses whipped into the box, leading to goals conceded . Cesc Fabregas, battling Marco Verratti, has not been firing on all cylinders since Christmas . Mourinho will also like to add another defensive option in midfield, for the really big games at the business end of the Champions League. Missing only John Obi Mikel from his squad, his midfield was dominated by PSG and Nemanja Matic, outstanding all season, played at full stretch, his passing not at its best, under pressure against Blaise Matiudi, Thiago Motta and the excellent Marco Verratti. The form of Cesc Fabregas has been flat since his return from a hamstring injury and when he doesn't dazzle he does not have the defensive strengths to satisfy his manager. There are games against teams like PSG, when Mourinho would like another strong athletic presence alongside Matic. Diego Costa has been more noticeable for his physical play and histrionics than his goalscoring ability . Without the creative flair of Fabregas, the goals have dried up for Diego Costa, who may be off the pace because of his ban, as Mourinho claimed, but also seems to be distracted by the need to prove he will not change his physical game to appease those who don't like it. Eden Hazard shows no sign of losing his mojo but Drogba's influence has faded through the season and Remy does not appear to be trusted. So Chelsea expect be in the market for options up front, too. Mourinho always says a manager can never be happy and even if, as expected, he goes on to claim the title, he will be busy this summer. Some people thought he had already built one of the great teams of the modern era, but there is work to do and no-one knows it more than him.","highlights":"Chelsea have let leads slip 11 times this season .\nJose Mourinho's side now out of the Champions League .\nChelsea are currently five points clear with a game in hand .\nREAD: Mourinho and his snarling  beasts always find a way to offend .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Chelsea news ."}
{"article":"Peshawar, Pakistan (CNN)A former lawyer for the doctor who helped the CIA look for Osama bin Laden has been shot dead in northwest Pakistan, police said. Unidentified gunmen attacked the lawyer, Samiullah Afridi, in his car near the city of Peshawar on Tuesday, said Mian Saeed, a police superintendent in Peshawar. Two different militant groups claimed responsibility for the killing. The lawyer had represented Dr. Shakeel Afridi, who was convicted of treason in 2012 by a Pakistani tribal court and is now serving a 23-year prison sentence. The two men are not related. The doctor helped the CIA set up a fake vaccination campaign in an attempt to collect DNA samples from relatives of Bin Laden in an effort to verify his presence in a compound in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad. The Qaeda leader was killed in a U.S. raid on the compound in May 2011. It was unclear which of the two groups claiming responsibility for the attack was actually behind it. Fahad Marwat, a spokesman for the militant group Jundallah, told CNN that Afridi was on the group's hit list. But Ehsanullah Ehsan, a spokesman for a faction of the Pakistani Taliban, said his group had carried out the assassination because Samiullah Afridi defended the doctor, whom he described as \"a friend\" of bin Laden's killers. CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen said Jundallah is \"kind of a splinter group\" of the Pakistani Taliban that's \"been around for a long time.\" \"They're extremely violent,\" he said. \"They've been killing all sorts of religious minorities in Pakistan.\" Last month, the group claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing outside a Shiite mosque in the city of Rawalpindi. Bergen said Dr. Afridi is \"a very unpopular figure in Pakistan\" because of the perception that he was involved in helping find Bin Laden. \"And his lawyer, by extension, would also be seen as an unpopular person because of that perception,\" he said. But Bergen said he didn't think the doctor played a key role in the hunt for Bin Laden. \"The idea was the doctor and his staff would take DNA samples from the Bin Laden kids as part of this 'vaccination program,'\" he said.  \"That never happened because the kids never came out.\" Although Dr. Afridi was working for U.S. intelligence, \"the CIA wasn't telling the doctor, you're helping us find bin Laden,\" Bergen said. After the killing of bin Laden, health workers administering polio vaccinations have come to be viewed with suspicion by many Pakistanis. The vaccination teams have repeatedly been targeted by militants. The latest instance came Wednesday when unidentified attackers killed one polio vaccination worker and wounded another in Bajaur agency in northwestern Pakistan, local authorities said. Journalist Zahir Shah reported from Peshawar, and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Sophia Saifi and journalist Saleem Mehsud contributed to this report.","highlights":"A second militant group claims responsibility for the killing .\nSamiullah Afridi had represented Dr. Shakeel Afridi, who was convicted of treason ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Three and a half decades after calling for homosexuals to be stoned, former Bob Jones University President Bob Jones III has apologized. \"I take personal ownership of this inflammatory rhetoric,\" Jones said.  \"This reckless statement was made in the heat of a political controversy 35 years ago.\" The weekend apology came days after the conservative Christian school in South Carolina received a petition asking for an apology for a statement Jones made to the Associated Press in 1980 at the White House. \"I'm sure this will be greatly misquoted,\" Jones said at the time. \"But it would not be a bad idea to bring the swift justice today that was brought in Israel's day against murder and rape and homosexuality. I guarantee it would solve the problem post-haste if homosexuals were stoned, if murderers were immediately killed as the Bible commands.\" When he made the comments, Jones was part of a group of fundamentalist ministers who went to the White House with 70,000 signatures on a petition opposed to extending provisions of the Civil Rights Act to homosexuals. \"Upon now reading these long-forgotten words, they seem to me as words belonging to a total stranger -- were my name not attached,\" Jones said in Saturday's statement.  \"I cannot erase them, but wish I could, because they do not represent the belief of my heart or the content of my preaching.\" Bob Jones University has long been a center of controversy for its fundamentalist stances. In 1975, the school adopted rules banning interracial dating. BJU received national attention on the issue in 2000 when George W. Bush, then a presidential candidate, visited the campus.

{"article":"(CNN)On the basketball court, Karl Turk forgets that he walks with a limp and a cane. He'll get so caught up in the moment that he'll gesture with his hands to make a point and his cane will go flying. He's in the zone. Now, the man who was told he might never walk again is coaching his team in the state playoffs. Turk is the head basketball coach at West Oso High School in Corpus Christi, Texas. His team just clinched the district championship after an undefeated district season and are playing in the Texas State Basketball playoffs. It's an impressive run for his first season as head coach -- and an inspiration to his young players. \"Coach shows us to never give up on any of your dreams,\" says 14-year-old starter Creighton Avery, who has known Turk since he was 9. Turk has been obsessed with basketball since he was a boy growing up in Indiana. When he was 5 years old, he learned to read by studying the sports pages with his grandfather. By the time he was 13, he was dreaming of playing for the Indiana Pacers. All that changed on January 21, 1994. That night, the 14-year-old watched the Chicago Bulls beat his Pacers in an intense game. He walked to bed. He woke up paralyzed. He was rushed in an ambulance to the hospital. For two weeks, he was completely paralyzed from the waist down and had temporarily lost some of his eye sight.  After numerous tests, Turk was diagnosed with Transverse Myelitis, a rare disease that causes inflammation of the spinal cord. Turk and his family were facing the harsh truth about what his quality of life would be like. He had to cope with the fact that he may not walk again. \"Most patients do not recover well,\" said Turk. He spent the next 66 days in the hospital. A turning point came when Reggie Miller, the Indiana Pacers' all-star player and Turk's favorite basketballer, heard about what Turk was going through and paid him a visit in the hospital. Miller and Turk spent the next couple hours discussing each of their stories. The basketball player told him about growing up with pronated hips and having to wear leg braces, similar to the ones Turk was wearing at the time. He talked about what it took to be in the NBA: that many good ball players failed to embrace and work on what they were not good at, and personality and character weeded many good players out. \"Reggie inspired me and helped me to embrace who I was,\" Turk said. \"For that moment, I felt he believed in me and saw my potential for greatness.\" It's a message that stuck with him as he entered high school in a wheelchair and began to adjust his dreams. There was hope he could walk on his own again but he would have to have assistance. Turk participated in a rigorous physical therapy regimen and by his senior year he shed his last leg brace and began to walk with a cane, which he continues to walk with today. \"I keep that last leg brace today on my desk as a reminder of where I have come from,\" said Turk. Turk attended Indiana State University, where his dream to play college basketball turned into dreams of wanting to coach. In 2004, he met Coach Ronnie Arrow, the head basketball coach at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, at a summer basketball camp and later worked for Arrow as the school's director of basketball operations. \"When you first see him, you may think he can't do what others can,\" Arrow, now retired, told CNN. \"But he gets the job done no matter what.\" All Turk wanted was to coach his own basketball team. But it wasn't so easy. From 2009 to 2010, he applied for 10 high school head coaching positions and numerous assistant coaching positions. He only received one interview. The forced sabbatical led him to wonder if he really had a future in coaching. \"I knew my resume was competitive,\" he said. \"I knew my passion for the game wasn't exceeded by anyone.\" He began to wonder if \"having a cane and an unusual gait\" would prevent him from ever coaching. In the two years when he didn't have a team to coach, he studied other coaches' methods and sought their advice on how he could improve. In 2010, he was hired as assistant coach at West Oso. And in 2014, almost 10 years after moving to Corpus Christi, he became the head coach. He has strived to embody the ideals that Reggie Miller imparted to him all those years ago in the hospital. \"I want my students to know that I care about them, that I work for and belong to them,\" said Turk. \"So often, it's the messenger more than the message, I want to be the messenger that my students embrace.\" In his dreams, he can still play basketball. In reality, he has fallen down in practice, and during games. There isn't much room on the sidelines to walk up and down, and he often trips over his athletes' feet. \"It hurts me that there are things that I cannot physically demonstrate -- a lot of the footwork stuff with stops, turns and jumps.\" But his players don't seem to mind. \"We don't notice his disability, we see him as a great coach,\" said starter Creighton Avery. \"He is always positive and inspires us.\"","highlights":"Karl Turk, who was told he may never walk again, is coaching in the state playoffs .\nIndiana Pacer visited Turk and inspired him to embrace his disability .\nTurk applied for 10 head coaching positions, only to have one interview ."}
{"article":"New York (CNN)The house is primitive, constructed of baked mud and stone. The landscape is sparse and mountainous, with snow cover in the winter. The terrain is rugged and challenging for the long walks the owner liked to take with his sons. Photographs quietly introduced as evidence in the latest major terrorism trial in Manhattan federal court offer a rare look inside Osama bin Laden's lair -- years before al Qaeda flew hijacked planes into buildings or bombed U.S. embassies in Africa and even before the FBI placed bin Laden on its Most Wanted List. Still, bin Laden was preparing, hiding out in a remote, mountainous area of Afghanistan known as Tora Bora. A remarkable set of photos -- the first showing bin Laden in the hideout where he would seek refuge after 9\/11 -- came to light only last month in the terrorism conspiracy trial of bin Laden lieutenant Khaled al-Fawwaz, a communications conduit for al Qaeda in London in the mid-1990s. Al-Fawwaz would arrange bin Laden's first television interview for CNN's Peter Arnett and Peter Bergen in 1997 and a sit-down for ABC News' John Miller a year later. But before then, al-Fawwaz called on a Palestinian print journalist, whose 1996 journey to Afghanistan yielded these photos. Bin Laden had declared war on the United States and wanted more people to know it, especially in the Arab world. He reached out to Abdel Barri Atwan, the founder and then-editor-in-chief of Al-Quds Al-Arabi, an independent Arabic weekly published in London that had been critical of certain Arab regimes and the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Atwan had broken the story about bin Laden's first fatwa, or religious decree, stating his grievances against the United States, such as the presence of U.S troops in Saudi Arabia. He published the entire screed in August 1996. The next month, al-Fawwaz went to Atwan's office to offer him the first print interview with the emerging jihadist leader in Afghanistan. \"I was told that Osama bin Laden was fond of my writing, he liked my style, and he wanted to meet me personally,\" Atwan recalled in an interview for Bergen's 2006 book, \"The Osama bin Laden I Know.\" \"I was hesitant, because it was very dangerous.\" Danger aside, in November 1996, Atwan was airborne to Afghanistan. The date-stamped photographs from his trip -- which Scotland Yard detectives discovered two years later in a search of al-Fawwaz's London home -- show a healthy, relaxed, sometimes smiling bin Laden, not yet 40, conversing, hiking, videotaping pronouncements, surrounded by children. The photos also show rare images of another man who has become an influential ideologue in the global jihadist movement -- Mustafa Setmariam Nasar, better known as Abu Musab al-Suri, a Syrian now in his mid-50s who has not been seen in public or heard from in a decade. Still, al-Suri is arguably the most influential strategic thinker in Islamist militant circles today. \"A generation of jihadis were influenced by his teachings,\" said Paul Cruickshank, a CNN terrorism analyst who has written about al-Suri. \"He wanted a global jihadist intifada, where people rose up and fought  as individuals. \"His teachings have deeply influenced jihadis in Syria -- how to build up an organization, how to win support for it,\" he said. Bin Laden, from Saudi Arabia, first went to Afghanistan in the 1980s to participate in the armed resistance to Soviet invaders, one of thousands of Arab fighters defending a Muslim nation. As the anti-Soviet jihad wound down, bin Laden began organizing al Qaeda, meaning \"the base,\" around the border city of Peshawar, Pakistan. By 1992, Pakistan forced him and his fighters to leave. Bin Laden relocated to Khartoum, Sudan, welcomed by a new Islamist regime. But after four years headquartered there, in 1996, under pressure from the United States, Sudan made bin Laden go. By then, the ideologically in sync Taliban had taken control of Afghanistan, and bin Laden decided to move there. In May 1996, bin Laden settled in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad. His mountain fortress in Tora Bora was a long drive up a dirt road he had built. Atwan was driven there in a red Toyota pickup in a twisting seven-hour drive through the mountains. As a photo of him shows, Atwan donned Afghan-style baggy trousers and a turban to get past security checkpoints and fit in. Atwan met bin Laden in his cave. It was small, 13 by 20 feet in Atwan's estimation, and as the new photos show, it was lined with shelves of books about the Koran and the Prophet Mohammed. Bin Laden liked to use the bookshelves as a backdrop for his videotaped edicts and interviews. The cave not only offered bin Laden a hiding place but also street credibility in the Muslim world, as the prophet is believed to have received the revelations of the Koran while camped in his own mountain cave. After hours of conversation and an inedible dinner featuring salty cheese and sandy bread, Atwan ended up bunking in the cave on a mattress that rested on boxes of grenades. \"He wanted media exposure,\" Atwan recalled in the interview for Bergen's 2006 book. \"He wants to say, 'Now I am an international figure; I'm not just a Saudi. I am aggrieved at  Americans who are occupying Saudi Arabia who are desecrating the Holy Land.' \" As seen in the photographs, bin Laden always carried a Russian-made Kalashnikov rifle. His comrades addressed him as \"Abu Abdullah,\" for father of Abdullah, his eldest son. Two younger sons, Saad and Ali, then in their early teens, sometimes were at the compound. As one photo shows, Atwan and bin Laden took a two-hour walk around Tora Bora. \"He loved that nature there. He loved the mountain. They were trying to have their own community, grow their foods,\" Atwan recalled. \"It's like an oasis in Afghanistan.\" Bin Laden's three wives and more than a dozen children did not share bin Laden's joy in living the life of medieval peasants in the Tora Bora mountains, where the only light at night was from the moon and gas lanterns, and the only heat in a place where tremendous blizzards were common was a wood-burning metal stove. Hunger was a frequent companion to the bin Laden children who lived on a subsistence diet of rice, bread, eggs and that salty cheese. In December 2001, with U.S. troops retaliating for 9\/11 closing in, bin Laden fled Tora Bora, eventually making his way to Pakistan, where U.S. Navy SEALs ended a decade-long manhunt by killing him in his Abbottabad hideout, an hour north of Islamabad. Atwan stepped down from the helm of Al-Quds in 2013 and recapped his journey in a deposition for the al-Fawwaz trial. Al-Fawwaz was convicted in Manhattan federal court on February 26 and faces a possible life sentence. Even in Tora Bora, Atwan felt bin Laden was vulnerable to intelligence agencies. \"I thought this man would not last,\" Atwan said Tuesday. \"He wasn't really well-protected. He was visible and moving freely.\" In 1996, bin Laden knew but certainly did not disclose the lethal plots he had set in motion -- the embassy bombings, the planes plot that would become 9\/11. Atwan said, \"He was very optimistic, and it never occurred to me that this would be the most be dangerous man in the world.\" With his pale skin, short red hair and beard, and green wool hat, Abu Musab al-Suri could pass for Irish.  But he is Syrian, originally from the ancient city of Aleppo, fought in the anti-Soviet Afghan war, and lived in London in the 1990s. Al-Suri was close to bin Laden, which explains his comfortable presence in the 1996 photos of Tora Bora, seated next to al Qaeda's leader in his cave or hiking with him, carrying his own cameras. (Al-Suri also accompanied Bergen and Arnett on their visit to bin Laden in 1997.) The United States has since accused al-Suri of training recruits at al Qaeda's pre-9\/11 al-Ghuraba and Derunta camps in Afghanistan, where operatives such as Ahmed Ressam, who planned to bomb Los Angeles International Airport in December 1999, learned how to kill with poisons and chemicals. Eventually, al-Suri publicly criticized bin Laden for making al Qaeda so hierarchical, for courting publicity and being so controlling, even calling him a \"Pharoah\" for his imperial leadership style. But al-Suri was no less militant. He set up his own training camp in Afghanistan and advocated a \"leaderless jihad\" featuring, as he put it, \"spontaneous operations performed by individuals and cells all over the whole world without connection between them.\" Al-Suri summarized his philosophy in his 1,600-page treatise, \"The Call for Global Islamic Resistance,\" which he published on the Internet in 2004. He coined the Arabic slogan nizam, la tanzim, meaning \"a system, not an organization,\" to describe his belief that there should be no organizational bonds between \"resistance fighters.\" Al-Suri advocated terrorist cells of no more than 10 men and envisioned more \"lone-wolf\" attacks, such as the Fort Hood, Texas, massacre carried out in 2009 by rogue U.S. Army Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, who was inspired by the radical Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, himself an al-Suri disciple. Strategically, al-Suri argued, a less centralized jihadist network would make operatives who were arrested less likely to expose fellow militants to intelligence or law enforcement agencies, because the fighters would not know who else was part of the movement. Al-Suri was forward thinking about al Qaeda evolving into an international ideology more than a centrally controlled organization. After 9\/11, al-Suri appeared on the U.S. Most Wanted Terrorists list with a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. In 2005, al-Suri was tracked down in Quetta, Pakistan, and sent to Syria, where he was imprisoned. There were unconfirmed reports that he was released in 2012, followed by al Qaeda statements by leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and spokesman Adam Gadahn in 2014 saying, \"May Allah release him.\" A decade after his arrest, al-Suri's whereabouts are a mystery.

{"article":"Delhi (CNN)A court in New Delhi Wednesday summoned India's former Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, as a suspect in a trial over alleged irregularities in the allocation of coal blocks, a spokeswoman for the investigating agency told CNN. Singh and his former government have repeatedly denied accusations they cost the treasury billions of dollars in lost revenue by selling coalfields to private companies, without allowing competitive bidding. The 82-year-old leader, who served as the nation's prime minister for two successive terms until last year, was not named as a defendant in the original dossier of charges, said Kanchan Prasad, the spokeswoman for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Nevertheless, the trial court summoned him and some other corporate leaders to testify in person on April 8, she said. The case Singh has been asked to appear for relates to the licensing of a coal block to a private firm some 10 years ago, when he was also guardian of the nation's coal ministry. The summons has been issued under India's anti-corruption law. Singh said he was open to legal scrutiny. \"(I) Am sure that the truth will prevail and I will get a chance to put forward my case with all the facts. I have always said I am open for legal scrutiny. Of course I am upset,  but this is part of life,\" he said in a text message issued by his office. Singh's Congress Party also came to his defense. The former prime minister functioned with \"utmost probity and utmost transparency\" during his term, said senior Congress Party leader Manish Tiwari. He said Singh's legal team would thoroughly examine the summons, and indicated it may be challenged in a higher court. The Oxford-Cambridge educated Singh has been credited with ushering in economic reforms in India as its finance minister in the 1990s. In his first term as prime minister, he initiated a historic nuclear deal with the United States that ended the South Asian nation's decades-old isolation in the global nuclear market. His second tenure was hit by the unearthing of a series of scandals spread across various sectors. In 2012, the national auditor alleged a widespread scam in the allocation of coal blocks. India depends heavily on coal for power. The fuel is abundantly available in the country, but that's still not enough to satisfy the demand for energy in Asia's third-largest economy. For the current financial year, national demand for thermal coal to produce energy has been estimated at 551.6 million tonnes, according to official figures. Of it, at least 84.7 million tonnes is being met through imports, coal minister Piyush Goyal told the Indian parliament in December. The state-run monopoly Coal India Limited (CIL) accounts for more than 80% of the output. Plans by current Prime Minister Narendra Modi for future privatization of the industry faced resistance recently, when CIL workers stopped work in January. The two-day strike -- the biggest of its kind in four decades -- not only severely limited the ability of the companies to meet their production quotas, but forced the government to go slow on reforms.","highlights":"Court summons former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh .\nDue to appear on April 8; case relates to the licensing of a coal block to a private firm 10 years ago ."}
{"article":"Even the world-renowned composer himself might have struggled to orchestrate better than Arsenal's 'Little Mozart' on his day. Rosicky earned that nickname during his five years with Borussia Dortmund, yet it was in Germany where he was labelled 'wasted talent' and Arsenal gladly signed the maestro in May 2006. 'When he is fit...' seem to be the same, old four words that crop up when Rosicky becomes the topic of discussion yet, even at the age of 34, he still knows how to make Arsenal tick. Tomas Rosicky earned the nickname 'Little Mozart' in Germany and he continues to make Arsenal tick at 34 . Olivier Giroud celebrates with Rosicky during their Premier League win against Queens Park Rangers . Rosicky has found minutes hard to come by at Arsenal previously but injuries can prove problematic . Pulling on the yellow of Dortmund from 2001, the all-round midfielder's potential was recognised. Remember Nike's Scorpion advert in 2002? Francesco Totti, Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Paul Scholes, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Luis Figo and Ronaldinho, among others, playing in a 'secret tournament' hosted by Eric Cantona. Then, among the world's finest footballers, was a 20-something Rosicky. More than a decade on he is in his mid-thirties, and getting better with age. Take the former Sparta Prague youth's cameo against Everton on March 1, for example. There was a moment when Rosicky chased the ball from Phil Jagielka, to Ross Barkley, to Steven Naismith, then back to Barkley, and won the tackle. It merited a standing ovation, before he settled the bag of nerves the Emirates Stadium had become with an 89th-minute goal to make it 2-0. 'This geezer's unreal, how is he 34? Still producing moments of class like that, he's a brilliant player,' one supporter said in his analysis on ArsenalFanTV afterwards. Rosicky scores against Everton previously as he came on as a substitute with just eight minutes remaining . Rosicky shoots to make it 2-0 to Arsenal against Everton on March 1 and settle their nerves . Rosicky should start against Manchester United but is not guaranteed to do so under Wenger . Rosicky mocked up as his nickname 'Little Mozart' 87 - vs QPR (March 4) 8 - vs Everton (March 1) 9 - vs Monaco (February 25) 14 - vs Crystal Palace (February 21) 18 - vs Middlesbrough (February 15) That's exactly how it comes \u2013 in 'moments'.\u00a0The Czech Republic captain doesn't devastate week in, week out yet he is guaranteed to put in a shift. The mentality to pass sideways is lost on Rosicky, who prefers to move the ball quickly and forward, showing as much energy and pace as those with years on him in the Premier League. Yet Rosicky\u00a0\u2013 a one-two kind of player, who bleeds the Arsenal way\u00a0\u2013 has averaged just 19 games per Barclays Premier League season under Wenger in his nine years in north London. The injury-prone playmaker has been unlucky, rupturing his knee tendon in 2008 before requiring surgery on an\u00a0Achilles\u00a0tendon in 2012. It cost him more than two years, and a niggle has always seemed to be round the corner since. Minutes have been hard to come by. Eighteen against Middlesbrough in the FA Cup, 14 against Crystal Palace in the Premier League, and just nine in the 3-1 defeat by Monaco in the Champions League at the Emirates. His eight minutes against Everton led to a rare start against Queens Park Rangers, and Wenger should persist with the playmaker. There is no doubt the Arsenal manager likes the man due a testimonial next year if he signs a contract extension.\u00a0'If you love football, you love Rosicky,' purred Wenger after their 3-2 win against Brighton & Hove Albion in the FA Cup fourth round. Rosicky treated that match as an exhibition.\u00a0His assist for Mesut Ozil's first half goal was ridiculous enough before a no-look pass led to a one-two that allowed Rosicky to score a volley in the second. You may remember it better for Phil Neville declaring he would 'two-foot him' if he tried that in his neck of the woods, but most saw it as sheer class from a thinker that views football akin to chess. Rosicky makes a no-look pass against Brighton which pundit Phil Neville found disrespectful . The Czech midfielder used the same move a number of times during Arsenal's 3-2 defeat of Brighton . During interviews Rosicky can look uneasy, like a teenager making a television debut, not a player just one cap short of a century for Czech Republic. Modesty, can be another way to put it. This week we heard Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 33, has years left. Can Rosicky keep being his tireless self? Well, a Jaguar Land Rover may be aged but, when it's only got so many miles on the clock, it runs as good as any.\u00a0Rosicky has been seen to by mechanics on the treatment table far more than he deserves but, with him now fit, Wenger should start the 34-year-old against Manchester United on Monday, then watch him go.","highlights":"Tomas Rosicky's career has been hampered by injury at times .\nRosicky earned the nickname 'Little Mozart' at Borussia Dortmund .\nThe 34-year-old averages just 19 games per season under Arsene Wenger .\nRosicky starred in Nike's Scorpion advert in 2002 with others such as Francesco Totti, Thierry Henry, Luis Figo, Ronaldinho and Ronaldo ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Under harsh lights in a private, rented room in Berlin, women face each other in violent, sometimes bloody battles of brute strength. There are no official rules to this female fight club. The fighters are both beginners and professionals, anywhere from age 20 to 50, said photographer Katarzyna Mazur, who spent months documenting the club in 2013 and 2014. Led by founders nicknamed Anna Konda and Red Devil, a match might pit a bodybuilder against a martial arts master. They can wrestle, throw punches or \"cat fight.\" There's no judge, just someone who knows the parameters they've decided for the match. The small audience is mostly made up of men, but it's a place for women to shed the roles they play outside. \"When I saw this kind of fighting for the first time, I was quite shocked. I had never seen something like that before, and it was really interesting to experience all of this so close,\" said Mazur, who photographed the fight club as part of her work toward graduation from photography school. \"Inhibition and fear do not exist on the mat.\" At first, Mazur said, she shot the fight club in color, but the look of the blue mat and neon lights didn't satisfy her. She shifted to black-and-white images and reduced her point of view, getting as close as she could to the action. \"It was not easy to work like that, because the matches were going very quickly and were unpredictable,\" she said, although fighters were respectful and would stop if someone was seriously hurt. \"I had to be very careful not to get hit. Fortunately, there are chairs on the side, so I could jump on them if the female fighters suddenly rolled under my feet.\" For all the aggression built into fighting, Mazur said, the project required a lot of sensitivity. She had to work quickly, and she didn't always know her subjects well. The bouts, the motivations, the scene can all leave a lot of room for interpretation. Mazur said she had to examine her own limitations, questioning \"How far can I go? Do they trust me? Am I allowed to do that?\" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. \"I enjoy exploring new worlds, especially a world which exists in a gray area,\" she said. She also had to remember that the fighters pushing and pummeling inside the club have lives outside, too -- they're mothers, partners, friends. Their actions on the mat might contradict how they live the rest of their lives. Even years later, the fight club is still running and is \"better than ever,\" Mazur said. \"Very often, I was very moved after seeing and editing the pictures, realizing what exactly happened there,\" Mazur said. \"It is important to always remember my role as a photographer and to always approach the subject with interest and (an open mind).\" Katarzyna Mazur is a Polish photographer based in Berlin.

{"article":"In the wake of Manchester City\u2019s recent Barclays Premier League defeat by Liverpool, the first thing the club\u2019s Brazilian midfielder Fernando did was seek out compatriot Philippe Coutinho. \u2018I wanted to say \u2018\u2018well done\u2019\u2019 to him after his winning goal,\u2019 revealed Fernando. \u2018To me, he is the best Brazilian playing in Europe at the moment.\u2019 Elsewhere at Anfield, the criticism of the City midfield that had started after the home defeat by Barcelona four days earlier was being cranked up to the next level. Fernando admits he is finding life in the Premier League tough in his first season since moving from Porto . Fernando (right) and Fernandinho (left) attends a Disability Awareness Workshop with local kids on Thursday . Fernando says Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho, tracked by his mate Fernandinho, is the best current Europe-based Brazilian player . According to those on TV paid to know, City had lost back-to-back games simply because of failings in central midfield. Fernando played in the first game and not the second. Was he, therefore, at least partly culpable for setbacks that seem to have done so much to damage City\u2019s aspirations at home and in the Champions League? Fernando: 'I haven\u2019t reached my level here yet and the language is a problem' \u2018It\u2019s really hard,\u2019 Fernando admitted on Thursday. \u2018I haven\u2019t reached my level here yet and the language is a problem. The Premier League is very challenging. \u2018This season has gone OK, I think, but I\u2019m hoping my next season will be a lot better. It was really difficult against Barcelona. We were not playing a normal team. \u2018We want to get to that level but we need to learn if we are going to be successful in the Champions League. We know we can win in Barcelona. But having an attacking mentality won\u2019t help us if we go over the top with that. Our mentality has to be right. \u2018The criticism will always come if things aren\u2019t going well. It can be aimed at the strikers or the defence and now at this time it is the midfield. It shouldn\u2019t do but that is just what happens.\u2019 City\u2019s shot at European redemption comes next Wednesday at the Nou Camp. Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s team trail 2-1 and need a huge result if they are going to become an isolated Premier League representative in the last eight. At home, City trail Chelsea in the Premier League by five points and have played a game more. On Tuesday, Fernando watched Jose Mourinho\u2019s team exit Europe in a rather feisty game at Stamford Bridge. On a night more memorable for needle than football, it was tempting to wonder if Chelsea were beginning to show signs of frailty. The Brazilian midfielder has come under fire as part of the under-performing City midfield, but showed some skills playing sitting volleyball for school children in Manchester . Fernando, who says mentality will be the most important factor for City in their bid to turn around a 2-1 margin against Barcelona in the Champions League last-16, attempts to play football with a blindfold . Certainly Fernando revealed he could not imagine his City team-mates hounding a referee in similar fashion. He did, however, have an interesting take on why some footballers - including friends such as David Luiz, Oscar and Thiago Silva - behave the way they do. \u2018It\u2019s not something that would happen in our team,\u2019 he told Sportsmail. \u2018We are mainly a very calm team that concentrates on actually trying to win the game on the pitch. \u2018We play according to whatever happens and we don\u2019t try to change things by altering decisions and trying to influence the result that way. The 27-year-old is assisted by a girl during the appearance as part of City in the Community . \u2018Every player has to hold things in. There are so many occasions when you actually want to say things but you must not. \u2018At City I follow the example of people like James Milner, Joe Hart and Pablo Zabaleta. They are players who just try to play and not talk too much. \u2018But you have to understand that the Champions League is a huge competition and the players were aware of that on Tuesday. \u2018It was two great teams wanting to go through. \u2018The players were aware of the investment each club had made so they had that pressure too. \u2018The players were tense and that\u2019s why these things happen. It\u2019s adrenaline and tension.\u2019 On Thursday at City\u2019s training base, Fernando and his team-mate and fellow Brazilian Fernandinho took part in a Disability Awareness Workshop with local schoolchildren organised by the club\u2019s City in the Community scheme. So close are the two that when Fernandinho was chosen for random doping after training, his friend waited for him before arriving to take part in the event. Fernando was also there at Anfield, of course, when Fernandinho and City captain Vincent Kompany had a rather frank exchange of views about what was going wrong. \u2018In every team and every player there is a need to talk,\u2019 he said. \u2018It has to happen. It helps. We are working to improve when things are going wrong. It\u2019s a quality and we will carry on with that. 'Fernandinho isn\u2019t even a tiny bit upset about. It\u2019s a story for a day and people like to talk but it means nothing to us.\u2019 Back at home in Brazil, they are still coming to terms with their own bad news day. That came last July when the national team flunked a World Cup semi-final, losing 7-1 to Germany. Fernando watched that game in a Brazilian restaurant in Manchester and put his hands to his head at mention of it yesterday. Now 27, he has international aspirations of his own but knows he - and his country - have much to learn. Chelsea players remonstrate with referee Bjorn Kuipers as he sends of Zlatan Ibrahimovic . Fernando attempts to hold off Leicester's Esteban Cambiasso as he continues to find his feet in England . \u2018It is really hard for Brazil now,\u2019 he said. \u2018We have had to learn a lesson from what happened. \u2018The Germans and the Dutch have improved and we needed to realise that we have to catch up. \u2018Tactically we have fallen behind. If I get called up then of course I will be extremely happy. I am focused on my performance here, though. \u2018Every players needs time to get settled and get his status. This is what I am doing.\u2019 Isaias paved the way for Brazilians in the Premier League on his signing with Coventry in 1995 . FIRST BRAZILIAN IN THE PREMIER\u00a0LEAGUE (AND FIRST GOAL SCORER): .

{"article":"(CNN)Spirit Airlines has a new fare deal and is announcing it with sex jokes. The low-cost carrier just acquired its 69th plane and is celebrating with $69 round-trip fares in April and May that include taxes and fees -- although additional baggage charges may apply. Round-trip purchase is not required, so you could actually pay $34.50 for a one-way flight. But the airline is getting more attention for its cheeky ad copy, which obliquely references a sexual act. \"We've been waiting to hit 69 planes for years,\" reads the offer on Spirit's website. \"It's our favorite number -- ever since we were twelve and found that magazine under our brother's bed (the one with the fantastic articles). Use your mouth to spread the word: Spirit is in an even better position to get you where you're going.\" Some observers say the promotion is sophomoric and has crossed the limits of good taste. \"You can't object to that price point, but you certainly can object to the discount airline's marketing strategy, which is so juvenile it led us to wonder if Spirit's website was hacked,\" wrote Aaron Rupar of KMSP in Minneapolis. Spirit spokesman Paul Berry, in a prepared statement, said the promotion reflects the airline's quirky culture. \"Spirit isn't your typical airline and we don't want to be. We enjoy being different than other airlines,\" said Berry, Spirit's director of corporate communications. \"When it comes to advertising, different means we don't spend a lot of money on advertising -- because that just increases fares.  But we're also different because our ads are fun, provocative, sometimes silly and often irreverent. They get lots of attention,\" he added. \"The vast majority of our customers find these types of ads humorous and accept them for what they are. We understand there is a small group of people who feel differently.\" The $69 fares must be booked by the end of the day Tuesday. Questionable taste or not, the promotion may be working: People were complaining on Twitter that they couldn't access Spirit's website to book flights. Based in Florida, Spirit Airlines is famous for charging fees for almost everything it possibly can. The airline's defense is simple: Pay for what you want on your flight, and don't pay for what you don't want.

{"article":"(CNN)Ferguson's police chief is gone. So is the city manager. And the top court clerk was fired for sending racist emails. But are these high-level changes enough to satisfy all residents? Absolutely not, they say. Protesters amassed in front of the Ferguson Police Department on Wednesday night, demanding the entire force be disbanded and calling for Mayor James Knowles to step down. \"Racist cops have got to go,\" some chanted. \"The people, united, will never be defeated,\" others said. Amid the protests, two officers were shot -- one in the face, the other in the shoulder. They were hospitalized in serious condition, and it's not clear who the shooter was. So what will it take to calm Ferguson? DeRay McKesson told CNN that protesters want the entire police department dissolved. McKesson was part of a group that appeared to be the largest crowd since November when a grand jury decided not to indict Officer Darren Wilson for shooting Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager. The killing was the spark that started a national wildfire of dialogue about police brutality. Many have decried rampant racism within the Ferguson Police Department. And a scathing 102-page Justice Department report backed up some of their claims -- citing widespread and systemic discrimination against blacks, including targeting them disproportionately for tickets. On Wednesday, Police Chief Thomas Jackson announced he's stepping down, effective March 19. He'll still get one year's worth of pay and insurance. CNN legal analyst Mark O'Mara said the entire department needs to be gutted. \"The Department of Justice report revealing unquestionable racist bias that permeated the entire department cannot be ignored, and the problems it reveals cannot be fixed from the inside,\" O'Mara wrote. \"If there are a few good cops in the Ferguson Police Department, they need to leave, and they need to go elsewhere to continue their proud law enforcement career without being overshadowed by their involvement in a poisoned organization.\" But city officials believe the police department can be reformed without being eliminated, the mayor told reporters. \"We continue to go through that report and talk about where the breakdown was,\" Knowles said. \"The city of Ferguson looks to become an example of how a community can move forward in the face of adversity,\" he added. \"We are committed to keeping our police department and having one that exhibits the highest degree of professionalism and fairness.\" Even if protesters get their wishes -- the resignation of Knowles and the disbanding of the police department -- they still won't get what they originally wanted: charges against Wilson. A local grand jury decided not to indict Wilson in November for the shooting death of Brown, who died August 9. The Justice Department launched its own investigation to see if there were any federal civil rights violations. \"There is no evidence upon which prosecutors can rely to disprove Wilson's stated subjective belief that he feared for his safety\" when he shot Brown, the Justice Department report said. Wilson resigned from the police department in November, citing security concerns. But he remains a controversial figure in Ferguson. When resident Sue Schmidt defended Wilson at Tuesday's City Council meeting, she heard vocal objections from the crowd. \"I'd like to say a lot of people in this room owe Darren Wilson an apology,\" Schmidt said, prompting laughter by some in the audience. \"The same Justice report that you're basing all your opinions on cleared him 100%.\" It's not clear who else may resign or get fired after the critical Justice Department report, which said Ferguson operated a vertically integrated system -- from street cop to court clerk to judge to city administration and City Council -- to raise revenue through increased ticketing and fining. Read the Department of Justice report . The investigators also found evidence of racist jokes being sent around by Ferguson police and court officials. One November 2008 email said President Barack Obama wouldn't likely be President for long because \"what black man holds a steady job for four years.\" Another email joked that African-American women should use abortion to control crime. \"Our investigation has not revealed any indication that any officer or court clerk engaged in these communications was ever disciplined,\" the Justice Department's report said. After the report came out, the city's top court clerk was fired for sending racist emails, and two others were being investigated, the mayor said. But the mayor hasn't resigned -- to the ire of many protesters Wednesday night. \"You got rid of Jackson, but we want Knowles\" gone, protester Kayla Reed said. Knowles said other reforms are already underway in an attempt to \"move this city, its residents and our entire community forward.\" But the community is clearly at odds about how to move forward.","highlights":"Two officers are shot in Ferguson overnight .\nPolice Chief Thomas Jackson's resignation is effective March 19 .\nProtesters want the entire department gutted and for the mayor to resign ."}
{"article":"(CNN)\"A picture of horror.\" That's how German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier described the site where a Germanwings Airbus A320 plane crashed in the French Alps on Tuesday. \"The grief of the families and loved ones is immeasurable,\" Steinmeier said, after flying over the area in the Alps in southeastern France. \"We must stand with them. We are all united in great grief.\" Departure: Barcelona, Spain, at 10:01 a.m. (26 minutes late) Destination: Scheduled to land in Dusseldorf, Germany, at 11:39 a.m. Passengers: 150 (144 passengers, six crew members) Airplane: Airbus A320 (twin-jet) Airline: Germanwings (budget airline owned by Lufthansa) Flight distance: 726 miles . Last known tracking data: 10:38 a.m. Last known speed: 480 mph . Last known altitude: 11,400 feet . Last known location: Near Digne-les-Bains, France, in the Alps . Sources: CNN and flightaware.com . Flight 9525 took off just after 10 a.m. Tuesday from Barcelona, Spain, for Dusseldorf, Germany, with 144 passengers -- among them two babies -- and six crew members. It went down at 10:53 a.m. (5:53 a.m. ET) in a remote area near Digne-les-Bains in the Alpes de Haute Provence region. All aboard are presumed dead. Helicopter crews found the airliner in pieces, none of them bigger than a small car, and human remains strewn for several hundred meters, according to Gilbert Sauvan, a high-level official in the Alpes de Haute Provence region who is being briefed on the operation. Authorities were not able to retrieve any bodies Tuesday, with the frozen ground complicating the effort. Wednesday may not be much easier, with snow in the forecast. Spanish and German officials moved to join hundreds of French firefighters and police in the area, working together to help in the recovery effort and try to figure out exactly what happened. As of Tuesday evening, there were few clues. One of the aircraft's data recorders, the so-called black boxes, has been found, according to French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, but it was too early to tell what it would say about the crash. \"We don't know much about the flight and the crash yet,\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said. \"And we don't know the cause.\" Relatives of those believed to be on the flight, fearing the worst, gathered at the Barcelona airport, where a crisis center was set up. French authorities set up a chapel near the crash site. Lufthansa Group said the company will look after the relatives of those on board. \"There will be a contact center established in France; relatives who would like to take advantage of this will be transferred to the contact center at no cost -- and their accommodation paid for -- just as soon as the center has been established,\" Lufthansa said. Those aboard included a \"high number of Spaniards, Germans and Turks,\" according to Spain's King Felipe VI. Germanwings CEO Thomas Winkelmann said it's believed 67 people, or nearly half those on the plane, are German citizens. Germanwings crash: Who was on the plane? Sixteen students and two teachers from one German high school, called Joseph Koenig Gymnasium, were among those booked on Flight 9525, according to Florian Adamik, a municipal official in Haltern, the town where the school is located. A crisis center has been established at the city hall in Haltern, which is about 77 kilometers (48 miles) north of Dusseldorf's airport. Winkelmann confirmed the 16 students and two teachers were on the plane. Haltern's mayor, Bodo Klimpel, said they had been heading home after taking part in a foreign exchange program. \"The whole city is shocked, and we can feel it everywhere,\" Klimpel said. A Dutch citizen and a Belgian -- the latter a resident of Barcelona -- were among those on the flight, according to those countries' foreign ministries. Two Australians and two Colombians were also believed to be on board. Germanwings started in 2002 and was taken over by Lufthansa seven years later as its low-cost airline, handling an increasing number of midrange flights around Europe. It was forced to cancel some flights Tuesday because there were crews that didn't want to fly upon hearing news of the crash. The valley where the plane went down is long and snow-covered, and access is difficult, said the mayor of the nearby town of Barcelonnette, Pierre Martin-Charpenel. It was well populated in the 19th century but there are almost no people living there now, he said. It's an out-of-the-way place with magnificent scenery, he said. The sports hall of a local school has been freed up to take in bodies of the victims of the plane crash, said Sandrine Julien from the town hall of Seyne-les-Alpes village. Seyne-les-Alpes is about 10 kilometers from the crash site. Mountain guide Yvan Theaudin told BFMTV the crash was in the area of the Massif des Trois Eveches, where there are peaks of nearly 3,000 meters (1.9 miles). It's very snowy in the area and the weather is worsening, he said, which could complicate search and rescue efforts. Responders may have to use skis to reach the crash site on the ground, he said. Sandrine Boisse, president of the tourism office at the Pra Loup ski resort, said she heard the plane crash and called the police and the local government office to find out what had happened. \"It was about 11 (a.m.) here. I was outside the garage, and we heard a strange noise, and at first we thought it was an avalanche,\" she said. \"Something was wrong. ... We didn't know what.\" A mountain guide who heard a plane fly at alarmingly low altitude shortly before the crash, Michel Suhubiette, said helicopters may be the only way to get to the crash site. According to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, just under 16% of aviation accidents occur during the cruise portion of a flight -- meaning after the climb and before descent. Accidents are more common during takeoff and landing. The twin-engine Airbus A320s, which entered service in 1988, is generally considered among the most reliable aircraft, aviation analyst David Soucie said. The captain of the crashed plane had flown for Germanwings for more than 10 years, and had more than 6,000 flight hours on this model of Airbus. The plane itself dates to 1991 and was last checked in Dusseldorf on Monday, according to Winkelmann. So what happened? CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo said the plane's speed is one clue. According to Germanwings, the plane reached its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet, and then dropped for eight minutes. The plane lost contact with French radar at a height of approximately 6,000 feet. Then it crashed. This could indicate that there was not a stall, but that the pilot was still controlling the plane to some extent, Schiavo said. Had there been an engine stall, the plane would have crashed in a matter of minutes, she said. That small piece of information about the descent means that the pilot could have been trying to make an emergency landing, or that the plane was gliding with the pilot's guidance, Schiavo said. A scenario where the plane was gliding is potentially more dangerous because wide fields for landing would be hard to come by in the mountains, she said. The crash spurred officials in several countries to offer their condolences and pledge solidarity and cooperation to help those affected and determine what happened. \"Our thoughts and our prayers are with our friends in Europe, especially the people of Germany and Spain, following the terrible airplane crash in France,\" U.S. President Barack Obama told reporters. \"It's particularly heartbreaking because it apparently includes the loss of so many children, some of them infants.\" Germany's Merkel said she was sending two ministers to France on Tuesday and would travel to the crash site on Wednesday to see it for herself. \"We have to think of the victims and their families and their friends,\" she said. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the German government had set up a crisis center in response to the \"terrible news\" and was in close contact with the French authorities. \"In these difficult hours, our thoughts are with those who have to fear that their close ones are among the passengers and crew,\" he said. CNN's Mariano Castillo, Hala Gorani, Laura Akhoun, Stephanie Halasz, Lindsay Isaac, Josh Levs, Richard Greene, Karl Penhaul and Sara Delgrossi contributed to this report.","highlights":"The plane reached 38,000 feet, and then dropped for eight minutes, Germanwings says .\nVictims from Germany, France, Spain, Turkey, Belgium, Holland, Colombia, Australia .\nOne data recorder found from Germanwings plane that crashed in Alps ."}
{"article":"The Tartan Army (officer class) march on Twickenham in a mood pitched somewhere between resignation and outright dejection. In the circumstances, none but the most blinkered of uber-patriots would castigate the fans for losing a little faith . With even some in the camp sounding as if there may be no beginning to their ambitions on Saturday evening, it\u2019s hard to foresee anything but a handsome home victory. It is almost impossible to imagine this young \u2013 in parts - visiting side succeeding where so many hardened men have failed. Oh, if ever we needed a touch of the gallus swagger that plays such a beloved part in our nation\u2019s sporting mythology, it is today at Rugger HQ. Somewhere amid the mix of technique and aggression required to stifle England, it would be awfully nice if someone from the current crop showed some inspired \u2013 maybe even swashbuckling \u2013 leadership. Vern Cotter's squad need to find a new source of inspiration if they are to triumph at Twickenham . Jonny Gray may only turn 21 on Saturday, but he has emerged as a key leader in this Scottish squad . Stuart Hogg (second left) is all smiles ahead of Saturday's Calcutta Cup clash in London . Greig Laidlaw is captain, of course. A tidy enough scrum-half well positioned to make split-second decisions on how to use the ball, he has plenty to concern himself with. Among the forwards, an increasing burden is falling on Jonny Gray, who turns 21 on Saturday. Many happy returns and all that. A member of Vern Cotter\u2019s \u2018leadership group\u2019, the man to whom Laidlaw hands his armband when replaced, the youngster is involved in calling line-outs and directing the pack. The risk, of course, is that the burden of responsibility dulls the energy and skills that make Gray such an exciting prospect. Would it be better, perhaps, to leave him to concentrate on his own game? Scotland know they will need to be strong in the battle up front if they want to be in touch towards the end . Scotland hooker Ross Ford leads a passing drill during Scotland's final preparations for Saturday's game . \u2018Ideally, yeah, you may think that,\u2019 admits Scotland assistant coach Jonathan Humphreys, the former Wales captain adding: \u2018But I compare him to Alun Wyn Jones, who I coached at a very similar age. \u2018These kids, they want it, they demand it. It is a growth within them. And, with Jonny, he doesn\u2019t see it as a burden. He wants to grow, he wants to learn. \u2018What I\u2019ve seen from him, he\u2019s a 20-year-old kid, I\u2019ve seen a huge growth in him in terms of how he handles himself within the group. He will use the experience of the last game, losing to Italy. He is a kid who will not repeat errors. He learns all the time. What Scotland will get out of this is just a phenomenal leader and a phenomenal character.\u2019 If it\u2019s obviously asking a bit much for Gray to emerge chrysalis-like from his cocoon in time to out-think and overpower a hugely effective English pack today, this might also be a perfect opportunity for the kid \u2013 winning only his 12th cap \u2013 to provide some firm and effective direction. The Scotland players have spent part of this week watching video footage of last season\u2019s humiliation at the hands of England, as well as dissecting the horror show against Italy just a fortnight ago. Scotland go through their paces at Twickenham on Friday - it's an important game for them to restore pride . Humphreys warned: \u2018If you go into a game just with passion and heated fervour then that lasts maybe 15 or 20 minutes. It is about process, the technicalities of what you are trying to do. \u2018That\u2019s the thing about getting it right. I don\u2019t think we got that wrong last year, it was just systematic errors that are still in our game at the moment. We need to learn from them and eradicate them. We need to get smarter as a group. \u2018We have a young group who need to understand that being on the wrong end of the penalty count does exert a lot of pressure on yourself. How do we eradicate that and make sure we are a little more disciplined in those areas? \u2018Obviously, you pull apart a game piece by piece. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done with the Italy game. We obviously took a step back in that game.\u2019 The last thing we wanted, heading into this penultimate Six Nations weekend, was a loss of momentum. Twickenham is a tough enough venue for visitors on a high, never mind those struggling for confidence. Scotland coach Jonathan Humphreys says Gray is thriving under the pressure, just as Alun Wyn Jones did . Scotland fly half Finn Russell (left) and full back Stuart Hogg work on their kicking on Friday . Those of us who have been making this pilgrimage, on and off, since the dying days of the amateur era can remember when Scotland\u2019s miserable streak here \u2013 only four wins in history, the most \u2018recent\u2019 in 1983 \u2013 felt odd, given that both sides were usually closely matched. With each passing loss, though, the sequence of results becomes more of a reflection on the gulf between these former rivals. England have moved on, found new best enemies, chucked us. Stick on the mournful Adele numbers and weep into your cloudy local ale \u2026 . Today, they *shouldn\u2019t* need to do much more than bully the Scottish forwards, a unit so effectively driven about Murrayfield by their Italian tormentors. \u2018The game will be based around scrummaging for penalties and driving lineouts,\u2019 said Humphreys, seeking no prizes for predicting the obvious. \u2018We defended 19 driving lineouts at Murrayfield last year, so we are aware of the strengths and how they want to play.\u2019 They will take some stopping. At the end of a week when even head coach Cotter has spoken about keeping things tight and staying in the game until the final 20 minutes, it feels like Scotland will do well to avoid being absolutely flattened. Unless \u2026 unless. Ah, we\u2019re not going to go down that road again. Are we?","highlights":"Scotland haven't beaten England at HQ since 1983 .\nYoung second row Jonny Gray is becoming a big leader for Scotland .\nVisitors will need to be tough up front to avoid being steamrollered ."}
{"article":"(CNN)A year ago, when Dr. Stephane Hugonnet was dispatched to Guinea to investigate a series of unexplained deaths, he had little  idea that he'd be contending with an outbreak that would quickly spread from a small southern rainforest village, across borders, and around the world. The Ebola outbreak, ravaging primarily Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, is a year old today. According to one official count, it's infected 24,000 people and killed 10,000. And it's managed to do so because of an institutional failure on several levels: weak public health systems locally and a painfully slow response globally. But in order to get to where we are, we need to go back to how it began. It takes a village . Before the virus ravaged West Africa, before the deaths soared into the thousands, before the outbreak triggered global fears, Ebola struck a toddler named Emile Ouamouno . The 2-year-old boy is who researchers with The New England Journal of Medicine believe was the first person to contract the disease in December 2013. Emile lived in a rainforest village in southern Guinea. How he got infected, no one is sure, but Ebola can be spread from animals to humans through infected fluids or tissue. One thing that is certain, within a month Ebola not only took Emile's life, but also those of his mother, sister and grandmother. From there, it spread like wildfire, passing to neighboring villages and beyond when people attended the grandmother's funeral. Where they went, the virus followed. By the time Dr. Hugonnet landed in Guinea, he didn't yet know that it was already too late. Hugonnet leads the Global Capacities, Alert and Responses team of the World Health Organization, and was one of the first doctors on the ground. \"We were following this rumor of a small cluster of unexplained deaths in Guinea,\" he said in a first-hand account of the early days of the crisis.  \"When the lab results came back, we learned that there was Ebola Zaire in West Africa. This was a first.\" Hugonnet was working with a team of logisticians, a medical anthropologist, laboratory technicians, virologists and infection prevention and control specialists. It was an impressive collection of professionals with the goal of rapidly assessing the situation and getting it under control, keep it localized. But this outbreak was different, Hugonnet said. \"Person-to-person transmission had quickly spread from a rural area to a large urban city,\" making it harder to contain, he said.  \"And, the outbreak was becoming multi-national; cases were confirmed in Liberia and were suspected in Sierra Leone.\" From those early days, the outbreak would mushroom. In July, Patrick Sawyer became the first American citizen to die at a hospital in Monrovia, Liberia. His case raised fears the virus could spread beyond the countries at the heart of the outbreak. And it does. International flights took the disease as far as Spain and the United States. On August 6, a businessman with Ebola died in a hospital in Saudi Arabia. He had been to Sierra Leone for work. Five days later, a Spanish Catholic Brother died in Madrid. And on September 20, . The Spanish Catholic Brother with Ebola, Brother Miguel Pajares, dies in Madrid. September 20, a Liberian named Thomas Duncan arrived in Dallas to visit relatives. He had been unknowingly exposed to the Ebola virus -- and he became the first known case of Ebola diagnosed in the U.S. He died a few days later. Meanwhile, the disease took an ugly toll in West Africa . By September, it had orphaned about 3,700 children in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.  Scared relatives didn't want to take them in, and officials worried the number of kids without parents would rise higher -- much higher. \"Ebola is turning a basic human reaction like comforting a sick child into a potential death sentence,\" said Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF's regional director. \"We cannot respond to a crisis of this nature and this scale in the usual ways. We need more courage, more creativity, and far, far more resources.\" Why didn't we? In a scathing new report, published Monday, Doctors Without Borders puts the blame squarely on a \"global coalition of inaction\" that waited months to respond to the epidemic. \"The Ebola epidemic proved to be an exceptional event that exposed the reality of how inefficient and slow health and aid systems are to respond to emergencies,\" said  said Dr Joanne Liu, the organization's international president in the report, \"Pushed to the Limit and Beyond.\" For example, by March 21, 2014, 78 victims had died, mostly in Guinea. The World Health Organization said at the time that while the Ebola outbreak is serious, it is \"relatively small, still.\" \"For the Ebola outbreak to spiral this far out of control required many institutions to fail,\" said Christopher Stokes, the director general for Doctors Without Borders.  \"And they did, with tragic and avoidable consequences.\" Local hospitals were overwhelmed. International response was weak. By October, when Sierra Leone was reporting a rate of five infections an hour, UNICEF said it had received only 25% of the $200 million it needed for emergency assistance for families affected by Ebola in the region. A significant challenge remains ahead, Doctors Without Borders says. \"To declare an end to the outbreak, every single person in contact with someone infected with Ebola must be identified. There is no room for mistakes or complacency; the number of cases weekly is still higher than in any previous outbreak, and overall cases have not significantly declined since late January.\" It's sobering news a year into the outbreak. Although the headlines have faded a bit from public view, the threat has not.

The FA are investigating the trouble, with Villa facing a large fine or even a partial stadium closure if negligence is established. West Brom manager Tony Pulis was disappointed that fans ripped out seats at Villa Park . Pulis compared scenes with fans on the pitch at Villa Park to trouble in the 1970s . Thousands of Villa supporters celebrated their win against West Brom by storming the pitch on Saturday . Questions will be asked about the meagre number of stewards, who were overwhelmed by a rush of Villa supporters. In 2010 West Ham were fined \u00a3115,000 for failing to control their fans when violence flared at a League Cup tie against Millwall. West Brom could also face sanctions over their fans, with one Villa supporter revealing to Sportsmail that he suffered a bloody head wound caused by a seat flung down from the upper section of the North Stand. Estimates suggested up to 25 chairs had been used as weapons. Pulis said: \u2018Those supporters should never come into another ground.

{"article":"(CNN)If you think \"my teen would never sext,\" you might be mistaken. And if you think the only teens who sext are the ones engaging in high-risk behaviors, like drinking, using drugs or skipping school, keep reading. Studies suggest that sexting is more common than many parents might realize or want to admit. More than half the undergraduate students who took part in an anonymous online survey said they sent sexually suggestive texts when they were teenagers, according to the study by Drexel University, which was published last year by the Journal of Sexuality Research and Social Policy. Nearly 30% said they included photos in their sexts, and an astonishing 61% did not know that sending nude photos via text could be considered child pornography. Another study, this one by the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, found that while students who admitted sexting were 32% more likely to report having sex the next year, sexting by teenagers was not linked to risky sexual behavior over time. The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, found that teens who sexted were not more likely to have multiple sexual partners, use drugs or alcohol before sex or not use birth control. Sexting may be the new \"normal' when it comes to adolescent sexual behavior, the study concluded. \"There are now a few pieces of research, which are sort of converging on the same finding, namely that this is not a rare behavior,\" said Elizabeth Englander, a professor of psychology at Bridgewater State University and director of the Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center. \"I'm not saying that it's healthy or that it's harmless, but it's not a situation where kids who are depressed are doing this or kids who have very bad self-esteem are doing it,\" said Englander, who researched sexting, as well as a host of other teenager behaviors, for her recent book \"Bullying and Cyberbullying.\" \"It appears to be widespread. It's engaged in by many kids who are functioning well and not having problems and it's not very unusual or rare.\" You're probably thinking: \"I check my kids' phones. No sexting happening in this household.\" But there are plenty of apps teens can use to send messages their parents can't find later. Snapchat, Cyber Dust, VaporChat and others allow users to send messages that disappear on both the sender and recipient's phones after a certain period of time. These apps are used by kids and adults alike to send a variety of messages -- from perfectly harmless to potentially dangerous. Brutally Honest: Is it OK to spy on your kids? Diana Graber, who teaches \"cyber civics\" to middle schoolers in Aliso Viejo, California, was blown away by the response she got from eighth graders when she, for the first time, included a session on sexting. When she asked her students if they knew what a sext was, everyone in the class said they did, but what they didn't know was what the penalties for sending a sext could be, including how it could be prosecuted as a felony under child pornography laws in some states. \"They had no idea what the consequences were,\" said Graber, co-founder of CyberWise.org, a digital literacy site for parents, educators, and tweens and teens. \"I mean that was a complete surprise to literally all 28 kids, so it occurred to me that no one's ever bothered to tell these kids they couldn't do that.\" Graber said she experienced another first that day. A few students wanted to hang around after the class, which is held at the end of the school day, to talk more about sexting and related things. \"That's never happened to me before with this class ... and I realized that I had created a safe space for them to talk about something that was super relevant to their lives.\" She now plans to make it part of her \"cyber civics\" curriculum, and believes parents and educators need to be talking to kids at even younger ages about sexting. It should be part of sex education, she said. \"We know that throwing the book at them, it's too much too late, so that's not working,\" said Graber, who offers tips for parents on how to help children have safe online relationships. \"It's very normal teenage behavior ... and we need to get with the times and get ahead of the problem, and just have these very easy to have discussions.\" Englander, the psychology professor and researcher, says in her experience, it's not that adults aren't warning teens about the criminal consequences for underage sexting or how devastating it could be to a teen if their nude photo became public. The problem, she says, is kids don't hear the warnings because the reality doesn't fit them. In a online article, she used an example of telling someone to use a seat belt because half the car rides in the country result in someone going through the windshield. Since half of car rides don't result in someone going through the windshield, a person might not listen to that warning, she says. \"If you want to convince somebody that something is a danger, you have to convince them that you know what you're talking about, \" said Englander. \"So you can't say to kids 'Oh, you are going to go to jail if you sext.' It's not 100% impossible but even in the early cases of sexting, when (law enforcement) did prosecute kids, they didn't go to jail.\" \"People have a hard time with this. It's not that I'm saying we shouldn't teach kids that child pornography is a crime. It is a crime, but if we emphasize that that's the big danger then we've lost our audience.\" Englander said what she is most troubled by is not how widespread sexting might be but how teens feel after they sext, especially if they felt pressured to do it. In her own research, she said she found that 92% of the teens who said they were not pressured to sext reported no problems afterward, but that number is only 68% for teens who felt pressured into doing it. \"They felt crummy afterwards,\" said Englander. \"That was actually the most common result, that they just felt worse.\" Lori Cunningham, founder of Well Connected Mom, a site specializing in simplifying technology for families, said parents need to remind their children about their own self-worth. \"And that no matter how tempting it is to want to be 'liked' by someone, they are worth more than degrading themselves for someone else's enjoyment,\" said Cunningham, a mom of two in Los Angeles. \"If parents aren't having this conversation, their kids could be going through some tremendous pressure.\" Cunningham also says parents need to be actively involved in their children's online lives. In an eBook, she outlines the points parents should go over with their child when they get a phone, including setting up a contract so they understand their phone will be monitored. \"Phones are a privilege, not a right. They should only be given to kids with the expectation that mom or dad will be checking it on a daily basis.\" What all the experts believe is that parents and educators should be talking to kids about obeying the law, protecting their privacy and reputation, and respecting everyone's right to keep their bodies private, but also their own values about the issue. \"Your kids can go into these things knowing absolutely nothing, having no idea of what you think is right or wrong, having no idea of the facts or you can talk to them about it. Those are the only two choices,\" said Englander. \"I don't think in today's world you can assume that they're never going to run across sexting, they're never going to see it, they're never going to know it happens.\" \"That's a big assumption to make.\"","highlights":"Sexting is more common than parents might realize, studies suggest .\nTeens can hide texts they send using apps like Snapchat, CyberDust and VaporChat ."}
{"article":"Warren Gatland has told Adam Jones that he will not \u2018get on his knees\u2019 and beg the curly haired Welsh prop to come out of retirement following a World Cup threatening injury to Samson Lee. Lee, 22, was on Tuesday given a \u201950-50\u2019 chance of being ready for the \u2018pool of death\u2019 later this year because of a ruptured Achilles tendon, with his recovery already delayed by a week after specialists in London decided there is too much swelling to perform an immediate operation. It has left Wales painfully low on experience in the front-row \u2013 the four props in the matchday squad to face Italy have just 11 Test starts between them \u2013 but Gatland maintains the onus is on Jones, capped 100 times, to reverse his decision to hang up his international boots. Warren Gatland has told Adam Jones that he will not \u2018get on his knees\u2019 and beg the prop to play . Samson Lee injured his achilles during Wales' 23-16 win against Ireland in the Six Nations . \u2018I was surprised at the timing of his announcement,\u2019 said Gatland. \u2018He wasn\u2019t out of our thoughts: we had played a little bit of phone tag, leaving messages and going backwards and forwards. If he has changed his mind and wants to get on the phone and say \u201cI made a rash decision, retired too early and want to be part of the World Cup squad,\u201d that is a different conversation. Jones passes the ball during the British and Irish Lions training session held at Scotch College in 2013 . Wales captain Sam Warburton reacts with Jones during the Six Nations in 2013 . \u2018At the moment I will not be going on bended knees ringing him saying \u201cplease come back, we really desperately need you\u201d. For us, it\u2019s about dealing with the other players. If Adam Jones wasn\u2019t retired from international rugby, then he may very well be in the squad now.\u2019 Making his Test debut in 2003, Jones became a household feature in the Welsh pack alongside fellow front-row Gethin Jenkins. While Jones will not feature on Saturday because of his retirement, Jenkins will play no part because of a hamstring injury. Asides from the changes up front, Gatland has stuck with the same starting XV that beat Ireland at the Millennium Stadium, with his side needing to overturn the points advantage of England and Ireland if they are going to snatch the championship. Prop Lee had to leave the field on a stretcher at the Millennium Stadium during Wales' win over Ireland . Lee was pictured on crutches with his foot in a protective boot after the match . If Wales do enjoy a landslide result at the Stadio Olimpico and pip their rivals to the title, they will find themselves in a position where there is no silverware to celebrate with. The two trophies are due to be sent elsewhere and - while there is understood to be disappointment behind the scenes - Gatland accepts that it is a logical decision. \u2018We can understand from the points difference that they are taking one to Twickenham and one to Edinburgh,\u2019 he said. \u2018If we do get enough points and win, we will celebrate in our own way. Maybe we will get some medals to hang around our necks or maybe we will have to wait 24 hours; we\u2019ll wait and see.\u2018 . Sergio Parisse limped off during Italy's defeat by France in Rome at the weekend . If Parisse plays he will be a major factor in Wales' attempts to win the Six Nations . After their early kick-off at the Stadio Olimpico, the tourists will move on to a black tie function at the Palazzo Venezia in central Rome. They will have to wait on tenterhooks, but any hopes of a thumping victory could hinge on the fitness of Italian skipper Sergio Parisse, who is struggling with a foot injury and is the heartbeat of the Azzurri team. \u2018He\u2019s a catalyst for them,\u2019 said Gatland. \u2018If they defend heavily in the front line with 14 or 15 men and we try to play too much rugby too early, they might get a chance of turnovers and penalties or intercepts. We have to negate two or three of their obvious strengths and put ourselves in a position to score some points.\u2019 Warren Gatland knows his team need a large victory to overhaul England and Ireland . Wales beat Ireland 23-16 at the Millennium Stadium to force themselves into title contention . Wales have identified the final 20 minutes as the opportunity to rack up their points difference and Gatland has named a bench loaded with attacking intent. Gareth Davies has usurped Mike Phillips to provide scrum-half cover for Rhys Webb, who on Tuesday signed a dual contract, while Justin Tipuric and Scott Williams will also be expected to make a late impact. \u2018If the championship comes down to points difference, that says to me there is not a lot of difference between the three of the four teams at the top,\u2019 said Gatland. \u2018We improve as a squad through campaigns and we have demonstrated that again in this competition. The exciting thing about the World Cup is the time we will have together to do in-depth coaching and stuff we do not have the opportunity to do in the Six Nations. The time we have together will make a massive difference.\u2019 Gatland's Wales side have a plus-12 points difference, 25 behind England and 21 adrift of Ireland .","highlights":"Samson Lee suffered a World Cup threatening injury in Cardiff .\nThe 22-year-old has been given a 50-50 chance of being ready to play .\nBut Warren Gatland has refused to beg Adam Jones to play in the game .\nGatland says onus is on Jones to come out of international retirement ."}

The clash between second-placed Derby and fifth-placed Norwich got off to a cagey start, with Bradley Johnson's off-target shot from long range for the home side the only effort of note in the opening stages. Norwich were very much on the front foot though and Alex Tettey and Jonny Howson also tried their luck from distance with no success against a Derby side who looked as though they had come for a point. On-loan midfielder Graeme Dorrans then had a clear sight of goal, only for a poor first touch to allow Johnny Russell to clear for a corner, before Cameron Jerome steered the ball just wide after being put in by Wes Hoolahan. Norwich City's Cameron Jerome scores his sides first goal of the game at Carrow Road on Saturday . Without their main men up front - Darren Bent and Chris Martin - the Rams barely posed a threat at the other end and it was no surprise when Jerome opened the scoring for the hosts on 31 minutes. A slick one-touch move instigated by Tettey ended with Martin Olsson crossing low for Norwich's top scorer to slot home from close range. Derby's appeals for offside were waved away and Norwich continued to dominate, although Russell's quick dart into the box did provide a rare moment of alarm for the home side. Norwich maintained their grip on the game in the early part of the second period, with Jerome heading over from a corner before Lee Grant's parry from a Steven Whittaker snap-shot prompted a scramble in the visitors' box.

Jamie Hanson and  Wesley Hoolahan compete for the ball as both side look for the winner at Carrow Road . Derby's lack of a specialist front man was painfully obvious although Tom Ince's low shot on the hour mark did draw a save out of Ruddy. But the Norwich keeper then made a horrible mistake to hand the Rams an equaliser they scarcely deserved. Hanson's 66th-minute corner from the right should have been a routine gather for the former England keeper but he took his eye off the ball and somehow fumbled it into the back of the net. City responded well to the shock and it required a brilliant one-handed save from Grant to keep out Sebastien Bassong's header from an in swinging Hoolahan free-kick. Grant then denied substitute Gary Hooper as Norwich looked for a grandstand finish before Jerome wastefully headed a Whittaker cross just over and Johnson then followed suit with his left foot.","highlights":"Cameron Jerome's 18th goal of the season gave the Canaries the lead .\nA blunder from Norwich keeper John Ruddy meant they were pegged back .\nIn the end both sides had to settle for a share of the spoils at Carrow Road .\nJust one point\u00a0separates\u00a0both sides in the\u00a0Championship after the draw ."}

{"article":"(CNN)The maker of a controversial documentary about rape in India, Leslee Udwin, told CNN she is shocked by the Indian authorities' move to ban the film without even having seen it. The storm over \"India's Daughter\" blew up out of nowhere and is \"based on nothing,\" Udwin said, in an interview for CNN's \"The World Right Now with Hala Gorani.\" \"The tragedy here is it's a missed opportunity for India to actually show by embracing the film... to show the world that India is as concerned as the rest of the world is to put gender inequality on the agenda,\" she said. The BBC documentary featured an interview with one of the men convicted in an infamous 2012 gang rape case in New Delhi that sparked massive outrage and protests in India. An Indian court restricted the publication and airing of the film in India as well as the dissemination of excerpts from it after comments by Mukesh Singh, the interviewed convict, were released in several media outlets. Singh appeared to show no remorse and blamed the rape victim for being out at night, according to the documentary. The government has also asked Google to remove excerpts of the film from video sharing site YouTube. A Google India spokeswoman, Paroma Roy Chowdhury, said it would comply on the Indian YouTube site, \"as we are required to do so by the local law.\" A statement from the company read: \"While we believe that access to information is the foundation of a free society, and that services like YouTube help people express themselves and share different points of view, we continue to remove content that is illegal or violates our community guidelines, once notified.\" Udwin told CNN the restrictions appear to have been motivated by fear of \"public disorder.\" \"I presume they mean protests,\" she said. It was, in fact, the street protests, not the brutality of the crime, that first inspired Udwin to make the film. But Udwin, who spent 16 hours interviewing Singh in prison over the course of three days, said the experience was chilling. \"He told me everything that happened that night, he told me everything about his attitudes towards society, women, hanging, all sorts... He blamed her -- the society blames girls, the society itself,\" she said. \"Look here's the thing: All this hysteria... people must understand these men are products of a learned attitude. They are programmed, they are brainwashed. The society itself tells girls to stay indoors after dark.\" Udwin said she had done everything she could to elicit a human response from Singh. She even had a list of the girl's horrific rape-inflicted injuries, from which she died, read to him in Hindi while she recorded his face. \"There were a few twitches but there was no remorse, there was no emotion, I don't think he is capable of emotion,\" she said. Singh, who was driving the bus on which the girl was attacked while traveling home from the movies with a male friend, is now on death row and has filed an appeal. But all Singh says about how he, and the other men convicted over the rape, have been treated is to ask why such a fuss is being made about them when \"everybody's doing it,\" Udwin said. At the heart of the matter, she said, is the issue of gender inequality. From birth, boys in India and many other countries are accorded a higher status than girls, so it's unsurprising that they go on to treat women as lesser beings. She compares gender inequality to a cancerous tumor that shows its spread through offenses against women. The dead girl's father, who is also interviewed in the film, explained that in order to send his daughter to medical college, he sold a piece of ancestral land -- a big deal in India, Udwin said. \"When he did that, his whole family was in revolt,\" said Udwin. \"They said, 'Why are you selling it to educate a girl?' \"Now that is a comment that is in the documentary, uttered by the father. Why is nobody saying to me, 'How dare you put that comment in the documentary'?\" In a statement, India's home minister said the documentary crew violated the conditions granting the jail interview, which stipulated that the authorities be shown all unedited footage. But Udwin strongly rejected that claim. \"It would appear that the home minister has been utterly misinformed,\" she said. \"The permissions to interview this man were absolutely cast iron and all of the conditions imposed by them were obeyed by me and my team.\" Udwin also speaks out for the \"massive swaths of Indian people who are so forward looking, who are so embracing of change and are agents of that change. \"There are extraordinary women's groups who have been working for generations towards this change. Those protests were so admirable -- that's what took me out there.\" And she stresses that the issues of gender inequality and sexual violence against women are not confined to India. The film ends with a series of statistics on sexual violence from other countries, she said, including the United States and United Kingdom. This means that \"no viewer is is left off the hook at the end of the film in terms of thinking, 'This is something that happens to people over there.' This happens to us, to every country,\" Udwin said. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.","highlights":"Documentary maker Leslee Udwin says she's shocked by Indian authorities' ban on showing her film .\nShe says the ban is a \"missed opportunity\" for India to show it cares about equality for women .\nUdwin says the root of the problem of sexual violence in India and elsewhere is gender inequality ."}
{"article":"High streets were given a helping hand yesterday as George Osborne (pictured) announced a \u2018wide-ranging review\u2019 into crippling business rates . High streets were given a helping hand yesterday as George Osborne announced a \u2018wide-ranging review\u2019 into crippling business rates. Introduced in Elizabethan times, the tax is accused of pushing independent shops out of business by charging punishingly high rates. High street retailers claim it places them at a disadvantage to online rivals because it is only charged on \u2018bricks and mortar\u2019. Business rates are forecast to raise \u00a322.4billion in England in 2014-15, from 1.8million non-domestic properties. But the Chancellor announced a review into the controversial levy, saying \u2018you cannot create jobs without successful businesses\u2019. \u2018In my opinion, the current system of business rates has not kept pace with the needs of a modern economy and changes to our town centres,\u2019 he said. \u2018It needs far-reaching reform.\u2019 Business rates are currently calculated according to the rental value of the property a company uses. But this is based on prices from 2008, the height of the property boom, which do not take into account the effect of the recession. The system also means some small shops on busy high streets pay very high rates, while online giants such as Amazon, with large warehouses in cheaper locations, pay less. Tax expert Richard Rose, of BDO accountants, said the review launch was \u2018welcome but long overdue\u2019, adding that \u2018any benefits of change are unlikely to filter through until well into the next Parliament\u2019. \u2018It will, therefore, be a watching brief for some time yet, which will offer little respite for mid-market retailers who continue to feel the pain of rates set in 2008.\u2019 Scroll down for video . 'Now the Budget's out of the way we can focus on serious issues like who's going to host top gear' Jules Winstanley, 51, who will pay \u00a315,000 in business rates for her two clothing boutiques, in Bath and Teddington, south-west London, urged the review to radically reduce rates for small businesses. \u2018We need a resurgence of help for independent shops so that we can compete fairly with the big boys,\u2019 she added. \u2018It is so expensive to have bricks and mortar and, if we don\u2019t protect them \u2026 we will lose that service and face-to-face contact that you will never get online.\u2019 Rain Newton-Smith, of the Confederation of British Industry, said the smallest businesses should be removed from the rates. The review began on Monday and retailers and organisations will be invited to give their opinions. But shops hoping for a large tax cut could be disappointed, as ministers have already warned any changes are likely to be \u2018fiscally neutral\u2019, meaning the Treasury would still generate the same amount of tax. Joanna Elson, of the Money Advice Trust said it was \u2018crucial\u2019 that the review considers how the rates system can \u2018better support small business owners who are struggling\u2019. Last year, MPs on the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee suggested the business rates system should be \u2018based on sales rather than the rateable value of a property\u2019. A raft of measures were unveiled to appeal to young workers. The national minimum wage will increase by 20p an hour to \u00a36.70 from October. This represents the largest increase, when adjusted for inflation, in almost ten years. The hourly rate for apprentices will also go up by a record 57p to \u00a33.30 an hour. This will result in an annual salary rise of over \u00a31,000 for a full-time apprentice and benefit 67,000 young people. The Government said this would ensure that \u2018those undertaking this important type of training are rewarded\u2019. Employers\u2019 National Insurance contributions will also be abolished for under-21s from next month, and for young apprentices from April 2016. This will encourage more businesses to hire young workers. Budget documents revealed that more than two million people have started apprenticeships under the current Government. In the last year, the highest ever number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds also applied to, and were accepted into, university. George Osborne promised income-contingent loans of up to \u00a325,000 for UK students studying for PhDs and research-based master\u2019s degrees. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of The Sutton Trust, said: \u2018The plans should improve the chances of low and middle income graduates taking on research master\u2019s and doctoral courses which have become the preserve of better off students.\u2019 Helen Dickinson, of the British Retail Consortium welcomed the boost for young workers. She said: \u2018Over one million of the three million people who work in retail are under 24. \u2018The abolition of national insurance contributions for under-21s will allow retailers of all sizes to create new job opportunities. \u2018The industry also employs almost 20 per cent of the UK\u2019s apprentices and abolishing national insurance contributions will make it easier and more cost-effective to employ and train them.\u2019 Charlotte Balbier, 34, (pictured above) is a wedding dress designer who pays \u00a328,000 in business rates per year. She welcomed the Government\u2019s review of the rates, which she said should be lowered to keep small businesses thriving. The designer, of Heald Green, near Stockport, started her business in 2003 and stocks 40 shops across Europe. She has seen business rates rise steadily. The rates affect her own showroom, which occupies two floors of an office block, but also the shops on the high street which she relies upon to stock her dresses. \u2018I would like to see lower business rates and less red tape,\u2019 she said. \u2018We supply 350 stores \u2026 and they are the shops on the high street who could really stand to benefit from a reduction in rates.\u2019 \u00a3143-a-year tax break for 4.6million who work for themselves . The self-employed were given a \u00a3143-a-year tax break yesterday. The Chancellor announced the Government would axe a \u00a32.75-a-week national insurance contribution (NIC) \u2018in the next Parliament\u2019, for the 4.6million who work for themselves. But it emerged the tax break could be a sweetener before a huge shake-up of NI, which funds benefits such as the State pension and maternity leave. The small print of the Budget revealed ministers were planning a \u2018contributory benefit test\u2019 \u2013 suggesting the self-employed may soon have to pay more for benefits such as the State pension. They usually pay two types of NIC \u2013 class 2, a weekly charge if profits are more than \u00a35,885 a year, and class 4, an annual charge if profits are over \u00a37,956. Mr Osborne made no mention of the new \u2018test\u2019 in his speech, saying only that he would be scrapping the unpopular class 2 NIC. The self-employed will continue to pay class 4, which is charged at either 2 or 9 per cent of profits depending on earnings. The class 2 tax, while not enormous, was seen as an administrative burden to pay weekly. Joanna Elson, of the Money Advice Trust, said: \u2018The scrapping of class 2 NICs will provide welcome relief for the self-employed, at least in the short term. \u2018What this means for their level of pension and welfare entitlement in the long-term, however, needs to be examined.\u2019 The self-employed traditionally pay less national insurance because they receive less in benefits, including the second State pension, sick pay and holiday pay. But, from April 2015, everyone will receive a flat-rate State pension irrelevant of contributions \u2013 which could put the self-employed at an unfair advantage. Ros Altmann, the Government\u2019s older workers adviser, said yesterday: \u2018It is possible the Government could off-set the tax break by asking [the self-employed] to contribute more towards the flat-rate State pension.\u2019","highlights":"Chancellor has announced a 'wide-ranging review' into business rates .\nTax is accused of pushing independent shops out of business .\nHigh street retailers claim it places them at a disadvantage to online rivals .\nBusiness rates are forecast to raise \u00a322.4billion in England in 2014-15 ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Could a simple blood test someday tell if you're genetically predisposed to post-traumatic stress disorder? That's what a team of international researchers is hoping after finding a genetic marker linked to PTSD in the blood samples of Marines stationed in conflict zones. \"We'll draw the blood and have a way to do this very rapidly and start to tease apart who is a little more at risk and who is a little more resilient for PTSD,\" says principal investigator Dr. Dewleen Baker of the University of California-San Diego. \"It's exciting.\" PTSD can occur after many types of trauma: rape, torture, child abuse, natural disasters and car, plane, and train wrecks, to name a few. According to the PTSD Alliance, more than 13 million Americans have PTSD and the societal cost is in the billions. Women are about twice as likely as men to develop the disorder. Symptoms tend to cluster into three areas: . \u2022Reliving the event via nightmares or vivid images, along with an extreme reaction such as uncontrollable shaking, chills or heart palpitations. \u2022Avoiding reminders of the event, including becoming emotionally withdrawn and detached from friends, family and everyday activities. \u2022Being hyperaroused, easily startled, irritable, angry, or having difficulty sleeping or concentrating. As one might expect, service members are hardest hit. The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates 30% of all Vietnam vets have experienced PTSD. Among troops recently deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, PTSD can run as high as 20% in any given year. But why does severe emotional trauma trigger PTSD in some people and not others? The idea that your genes play a role in whether you develop PTSD is a popular focus of recent research. Scientists have discovered genes that help regulate fear reactions in mice. The lack of a fear-regulating brain chemical called gastrin-releasing peptide led to greater fear response among the rodents. In another study, mice without a protein necessary to form \"fear memories\" were less likely to freeze up and more willing to explore unknown spaces. Studies of twins show heredity accounts for about 30% of the differences in response to trauma, with identical twins much more likely to both develop PTSD than fraternal twins. Other research has looked into the role of inherited brain differences, mental disorders, or addictive tendencies. An unusual avenue of research is how our immune systems may contribute to the development of PTSD symptoms. Prior studies of people diagnosed with PTSD compared to control groups without the disorder suggest differences in genes related to inflammation may play a role. \"The body is built to keep us alive and it functions as one big system,\" says Baker, discussing the interface between stress and immune chemicals. \"The systems all talk to each other.\" The recent study, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, is unique because it compares blood samples from 188 Marines taken before and after they were deployed to combat zones. Another group of 96 Marines was also studied to verify the results. \"Under this experimental design, not only can we identify differences between U.S. Marines with PTSD and without, but we can go back in time, so to speak, to see if any of the Marines who eventually developed PTSD\" showed evidence that it would emerge, says the study's co-senior author, Christopher Woelk. \"In this vein, we are able to start labeling findings as being putatively 'causal' in nature.\" In the blood of Marines ultimately diagnosed with PTSD, the study found biomarkers associated with gene networks that regulate innate immune function -- the body's first line of defense -- and interferon, a protein responsible for kicking the immune system into action. In addition, this hypervigilant immune response occurred before and after exposure to trauma. \"Why do certain people start out with slightly higher immune response and others have less? Is it somehow just built in or have they been exposed to some kind of pathogen?\" asks Baker. Instead of pathogens, another possible explanation is that the inflammatory response is activated by the stress of going off to war. \"You could try to dampen down the activation and see if that improves symptoms or prevents development of PTSD,\" says Baker. Baker stresses these questions are purely hypothetical at this time and that the study needs to be replicated and expanded. \"We're early in the process of having some clues as to what might predict risk and resilience, and with more research we'll begin to have effective preventions and treatments,\" says Baker.","highlights":"More than 13 million Americans have PTSD .\nGenes account for about 30% of risk .\nImmune system plays a role in risk and resilience ."}

{"article":"Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff has urged Formula One's moaners to visit the Wailing Wall if they want their prayers answered on a change to the sport's regulations. Wolff was responding to the latest complaints from Red Bull team boss Christian Horner in the wake of Mercedes' crushing start to the 2015 season as Lewis Hamilton spearheaded a one-two in the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. Horner was left to reflect on 'a s***** Sunday' and the fear fans will turn off F1 after Mercedes' domination of the race at Melbourne's Albert Park . Nico Rosberg showers winner Lewis Hamilton after Mercedes finish on-two at Australian Grand Prix . Hamilton races to victory as Mercedes extend last season's dominance into the new campaign . Mercedes chief Toto Wolff has told critics of his team to work to find a solution . After winning the constructors' and drivers' titles for four years from 2010-2013, with Sebastian Vettel at the helm, Mercedes have taken up the mantle of F1 powerhouse. Having won 16 of 19 grands prix in 2014 to claim the constructors' crown, and with Hamilton clinching his second championship, the start to the new year was a breeze for Mercedes. Hamilton beat team-mate Nico Rosberg by 1.3secs, with Vettel third on his debut for Ferrari but 34.5secs off the pace. Predicting 'a two-horse race at every grand prix this year', Horner has called on the FIA to act to prevent an F1 yawn, and he is fully aware of how his comments will be viewed given Red Bull's success. 'When we were winning - and we were never winning to the advantage they have - I remember double diffusers were banned, exhausts were moved, flexible bodywork was prohibited, engine mapping mid-season was changed,' said Horner of the steps taken to negate his team's performance. Red Bull's Christian Horner has complained about Mercedes, despite his team winning four consecutive titles . Horner claim that leaving Hamilton and Rosberg to fight it out for the title is unhealthy for the sport . Re-live every lap of the Melbourne race . 'Anything was done and that wasn't just unique to Red Bull, but Williams in previous years and McLaren, etcetera. 'Is it healthy to have this situation? The FIA, within the rules, have an equalisation mechanism and it is perhaps something we need to look at. 'Mercedes, take nothing away from them, they have done a great job and they have a good car, a fantastic engine, and two very good drivers. 'The problem is the gap is so big you end up with three-tier racing and that's not healthy for Formula One. 'The FIA have the facts and they could quite easily come up with some form of equalisation otherwise I fear the interest will wane. 'I didn't see Mercedes much on the TV and I can only imagine that's because it's not interesting watching a procession and the producer was looking to pick out other battles in the race.' Referring to the fact Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger conducted the podium ceremony, Horner added: 'The highlight for me was to see Arnie on the podium!' Hollywood star\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger interviews Hamilton after his winning start to the season . Responding to the call for equalisation, Wolff said: 'If you come into Formula One, try to beat each other and perform at the highest level and then you need equalisation after the first race - you cry out after the first race - that's not how we've done things in the past. 'I think 'Just get your f****** head down, work hard and try to sort it out'.' Quickly clarifying his remark, Wolff added: 'I didn't mean the f-word in relation to him (Horner).' Asked whether he feared another political season, Wolff replied: 'It is always a political season. It was last year and it is this year. 'There is this wall in Jerusalem that you can stand in front of and complain. Maybe the guys should go there.' 1. Lewis Hamilton (Britain) Mercedes 1:31:54.067 . 2.

{"article":"(CNN)An employee at the Tulane National Primate Research Center near New Orleans has tested positive for a potentially deadly strain of bacteria kept at the facility. The employee is not sick, and Jason McDonald, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the bacteria are not likely to be a threat to the general population. The worker tested positive to exposure of Burkholderia pseudomallei, which can cause can cause melioidosis, or Whitmore's disease. \"It is predominately a disease of tropical climates, especially in Southeast Asia and northern Australia where it is widespread,\" according to the CDC website. The CDC is waiting on additional test results to determine if the exposure occurred at the research center or somewhere else, McDonald said. The CDC and U.S. Department of Agriculture are at the campus, continuing an investigation that began in November when two monkeys were diagnosed with Whitmore's disease. Six others have antibodies indicating exposure to the bacterium. Since then federal health officials have been working with state and local officials to investigate the source. Blood tests have been conducted on nearly 70 primates at the center, with one testing positive for antibodies, McDonald said. According to the CDC, \"the bacteria causing melioidosis are found in contaminated water and soil.

{"article":"(CNN)Starbucks charges more than $5 for a large (\"venti\" in Starbucks speak) Caramel Frappuccino, yet no one bats an eye. But when the CEO of Starbucks announced a plan he hoped would ease racial tensions, the response was immediate outrage! This latest controversy started Monday when Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz unveiled a new initiative in which Starbucks baristas would write the words \"Race Together\" on coffee cups to help spark a dialogue on race. Schultz even took out full-page ads in The New York Times and USA Today touting this effort. Twitter immediately lit up with a flurry of angry tweets -- apparently from people who have consumed far too much caffeine. Surprisingly, though, the backlash came from all sides. One self-described conservative tweeted this: . A person who noted her support of progressive causes in her Twitter profile tweeted: . Even people in the middle expressed scorn with tweets such as: . I, on the other hand, applaud Schultz's efforts, at least in theory. As Schultz correctly stated when discussing the genesis for \"Race Together,\" \"If we just keep going about our business ... and ignoring this (racial issue), then I think we are, in a sense, part of the problem.\" Sure, I also see some logistical problems with the \"get your iced Mocha Frappuccino with a shot of racial tolerance\" approach. First, I live in New York City, where New Yorkers barely have the patience to wait for a cup of plain old coffee to be poured let alone stand in line longer while people engage in a nuanced discourse on race. I can envision awkward situations where the baristas ask a customer, \"So how do you want your coffee?\" to which the customer responds, \"Black.\" For some reason saying \"black\" in the context of this program could feel uncomfortable. Next thing you know, Starbucks will have to coin politically correct terms for \"black\" coffee. And as a practical matter, only 40% of Starbucks employees are minorities. Consequently, in most Starbucks, the conversation about racial tolerance will between be between two white people. But let's put those issues aside. The swift and angry backlash against Schultz's idea proves once again that not only don't we live in a post-racial America, we live in a hyper-racial one. In fact, a recent CNN\/ORC poll found 40% of Americans believe racial relations have become worse during the six years Barack Obama has been in the White House. It's strikingly obvious that if we are going to improve this situation, we need to have a candid and brutally honest discussion about the underlying factors contributing to racism, the lack of empathy for people of other races, etc. And that's simply what Starbucks' \"Race Together\" stated goal is: \"to stimulate conversation, compassion and positive action regarding race in America.\" Starbucks' senior vice president of communications, Corey duBrowa, deleted his Twitter account Monday after \"feeling personally attacked in a cascade of negativity\" and being \"overwhelmed by the volume and tenor of the discussion\" in response to \"Race Together.\" But duBrowa was back on Twitter on Tuesday night. Why? Because he truly believed in \"the power of meaningful, civil, thoughtful, respectful open conversation.\" DuBrowa's reaction may just be a teachable moment on discussing race. It's truly not an easy topic to broach. The initial response by some, like duBrowa, may be to shut down when racial discussions become uncomfortable. But then, hopefully like duBrowa did later, the conversation can be rejoined within a framework that's respectful to all involved. But to be blunt, one of the biggest obstacles in even starting this conversation is that most white Americans don't want to discuss race, as polls have confirmed. For example, after the grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, didn't indict police Officer Darren Wilson in the killing of teenager Michael Brown, a poll found that 80% of blacks felt that the shooting raised important issues about race that needed to be discussed. How many white people agreed? Only 37%. And personally I have seen some white friends become defensive when race issues are raised. Why? Because many view it as an accusation that they are somehow racist (or at least complicit in racism) as opposed to a starting point for a productive conversation. The question is how can we begin that talk about race that our nation desperately needs to have? True, the line at Starbucks might not be the best place. But it has to start somewhere if we are going to close the racial gap that many, including myself, feel is growing.","highlights":"Response mostly negative after Starbucks launches initiative to talk about race relations .\nDean Obeidallah: Starbucks might not be best place, but how do we start a talk about race?"}
{"article":"Andre Spicer is Professor of Organizational Behavior, Cass Business School at City University London. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. LondonApple CEO Tim Cook has released the much-anticipated Apple watch -- his company's first new product since the iPad. Cook said the new watch, in addition to telling the time, was a \"comprehensive health and fitness companion.\" But we're unlikely to hear much about how people will actually use this new product for some time. Our research has found that smartwatches certainly do have some benefits for users. But they also have a hidden, darker side which the companies selling them are unlikely to talk about. As part of a research project with Alberto Rizzoli, we have tried to understand what drives people to invest in smartwatches. One participant, a judge, hoped he could keep track of the deluge of emails during long hours in the courtroom when he had to pay attention -- and be seen to pay attention. The dilemma is familiar to many of us. We spend our days engaged in social interaction. Huge proportions of our time are taken up with meetings or impromptu encounters with colleagues. However when we are in these meetings, our smartphone is buzzing away reminding us that our inbox is filling up. We may want to check these incoming messages, but know it would be rude to glance at our phone. When one of the first smartwatches came to market, the judge thought he had found the solution to this problem. We found that heavy smartwatch users valued how the devices helped them track information as it arrived while still appearing socially attentive. It also saved users the hassle of having to dig through their pockets or handbags to find a buzzing phone. Surprisingly only about half the people we spoke with actually used all the health tracking technology built in to the watches. They were more interested in keeping abreast of their inbox than their calorie count. We also noticed a worrying side to these new devices as heavy users of the watches incorporate them into their daily routines -- we call it the \"phantom device effect.\" They would compulsive check their watch not just for the time, but for a wide range of information. In some cases their new gizmo would become such an instinctive part of their life that even when not wearing one they would check their bare wrist. Some would feel a phantom buzz, notifying them of an imaginary incoming email. The phantom device effect leads us to ask about just how ingrained in our daily habits these devices might become. Recent research has suggested that average smartphone users check their phone 150 times a day, starting just minutes after waking up. We also know this has the effect of extending work into all areas of our lives -- monitoring work emails late into the night or during social or family events. We used to worry that the average American watched television for six hours a day. Now we accept as a matter of course the fact that we tied to our devices for most of the time we're awake. Indeed many of us go to bed with our smart devices quietly monitoring our rhythms as we sleep. This raises the question of what impact it will have on our lives. In the work Carl Cederstr\u00f6m and I have done on the hidden dangers of wearables, a big big concern is privacy. The Apple Watch, like most wearables, is essentially a tracking device, recording heart rate, sleep patterns, movement, whereabouts, and much more depending on the apps installed. All this is packaged and transmitted to datacentres for analysis. The result? A database of personal information of which the Stasi could only have dreamed. As well as sucking up personal information, wearables could fuel an unhealthy obsession with personal wellness. By pumping health and wellbeing information at us non-stop, we start to become a little too focused on our bio-rhythms. Data which would have been generated only in the most unusual situations now becomes commonplace, making people not just health conscious, but also self-obsessed. Instead of checking in with social networks, we spend more time checking in with our own bodily rhythms. As a result other people start to become more interested in what is going on inside themselves rather than what is happening in the world. As we pay more attention to our feed of personal biodata we're likely to become more anxious about things that we may never have given a second thought to in the past. Not walking your allotted steps in a day or finding you had a poor sleeping pattern at night can become a source of significant personal guilt or worry. As a result, we pour more attention into monitoring and controlling ourselves, giving us less time to do the things which actually make us happy. If Apple's projections are indeed correct and tens of millions of people purchase smartwatches, it's likely to create a step change in our lives. We already see people routinely posting on social media information they would have only shared with their doctor a few years ago. Widespread use of smartwatches could mean that instead of relieving our boredom by answering emails, people will spend their time sifting through their biodata stream, planning ways to maximize their personal wellness ratings. Rather than talking about what was on television last night, people will start comparing charts of their sleeping patterns. When this happens we will know that the internet of me has arrived.

{"article":"(CNN)It's called the Grand Renaissance Dam -- and the clue is in the name. With some 8,500 laborers working around the clock on its construction, the imposingly-named dam is surely one of Africa's most ambitious infrastructure projects, reaffirming Ethiopia's ambitions of becoming a big regional player and a major exporter of power. When completed, the project will generate around 6,000 megawatts of electricity for both domestic use and exports. The most striking aspect of the nearly $5 billion enterprise is, however, that it is entirely funded by Ethiopia, without any foreign investment. According to the authorities, 20% of the project is financed from bond offerings to Ethiopians, and the remaining 80% from tax collection. \"It was seen as a strategically important initiative that the government and the Ethiopian people are financing it 100%,\" says Zemedeneh Negatu, managing partner at Ernst & Young Ethiopia. \"They have come up with a very creative and innovative way that I think will be a lesson for other African countries who want to embark on such large infrastructure projects, and want to have the flexibility to do it themselves,\" he adds. Hydroelectric powerhouse . So far, Ethiopians at home and abroad have contributed about $350 million, and the government says that the 170 meter tall dam is on track for a 2017 opening, with 40% of the work already complete. Ethiopia's per capita income might be one of the lowest in the world, but the country has enjoyed an impressive economic growth since 2000, averaging 10.9% annually, which has resulted in a 33% reduction of people living in poverty. If the Grand Renaissance Dam and other hydroelectric projects, such as the Gibe III dam on the Omo river, are completed on time, The World Bank estimates Ethiopia could earn $1 billion a year from electricity exports. Negatu says that this would make the country the largest exporter of power in Africa, and second only to South Africa when it comes to installed capacity. Unhappy neighbors . Yet, not everyone is happy about Ethiopia's energetic drive to harness its water resources. The Grand Renaissance Dam is being built on Blue Nile, a tributary of the Nile River which has been powering the agriculture of Sudan and Egypt -- through which it flows -- for millennia. These countries have opposed the project in the past, fearing that the dam will reduce their share of the Nile water. The ousted Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi had even threatened to defend \"each drop of Nile water with our blood if necessary\" back in 2013. Passions have been calmer more recently, and today the Reuters news agency reported that representatives of Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia reached a preliminary agreement  in Khartoum on how to operate the dam. Negatu is convinced that a compromise will be reached, as he thinks that the dam will ultimately benefit not just Ethiopia but most other East African nations. \"This is actually a regional project because up from Egypt all the way down to Rwanda, countries are going to buy the power that's generated by this dam,\" Negatu says, adding that both Rwanda and Kenya have already agreed to purchase thousands of megawatts once the project is finished. A lack of reliable power has long stunted Africa's development, with 600 million people on the continent not connected to the grid and getting by on a mix of generators, kerosene lamps and candles. In Ethiopia, only 15 to 20% of the population has access to power according to a study by Chatham House. \"It's Africa's Achilles' heel,\" says Negatu. \"With anyone who wants to build a factory in Africa, the first thing they ask is infrastructure, and within infrastructure, whether there is sufficient electricity. Industrialization has always been about electricity, and this [dam] addresses this basic need.\" He adds that, after depending on exporting raw commodities for decades, governments across Africa should be pursuing a strategy of industrialization, following the example of China. \"We've got to move up the value chain, and it's what Ethiopia is doing right now. Its strategy is industrial-based -- not to export commodities but to manufacture value-added things, and other African nations are trying to emulate that. But without electricity there won't be industrialization in Africa.\" More from Africa View . Read this: New railway links to transform West Africa .

{"article":"(CNN)The sounds recorded on one of the \"black boxes\" recovered from downed Germanwings Flight 9525 firms up investigators' theory that the co-pilot locked the captain out of the cockpit and then crashed the plane. \"For God's sake, open the door!\" Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer screamed as he banged on the cockpit door, pleading with the co-pilot. Thirteen minutes later, the plane slammed into the French Alps. The audio from the plane's cockpit voice recorder has not been released, but the German newspaper Bild published Sunday what it claims is a summary of the transcript from the recording. CNN translated Bild's report --  which the newspaper says is based on the 1.5 hours of audio that was on  the cockpit voice recorder -- but cannot independently verify the information. France's accident investigation agency, BEA, told CNN that the agency is \"dismayed\" by the voice recording leak to Bild. Martine Del Bono, a spokeswoman for the agency, said the leak could not have come from a BEA agent. She said the agency considers the report mere \"voyeurism.\" According to Bild's report, Sondenheimer told co-pilot Andreas Lubitz that he didn't manage to go to the bathroom before takeoff. Lubitz tells him he can go anytime. Lubitz is believed to have locked the pilot of Flight 9525 out of the cockpit before putting the plane on a rapid descent into the mountains, French authorities have said. The flight took off 20 minutes late. After reaching cruising altitude, Sondenheimer asked Lubitz to prepare the landing. Once that's finished, Lubitz again tells the captain he \"can go anytime.\" There is the sound of a seat being pushed backward after which the captain says, \"You can take over.\" At 10:29 a.m., air traffic radar detects that the plane is starting to descend. Three minutes later, air traffic controllers try to contact the plane and receive no answer -- shortly after which an alarm goes off in the cockpit, warning of the \"sink rate,\" Bild reported. Next comes the banging. Sondenheimer begs Lubitz to let him in. Passengers then begin to scream, according to the transcript obtained by Bild. Another three minutes pass. A loud metallic bang is heard at 7,000 meters (almost 23,000 feet). A minute and half later and 2,000 meters (about 6,500 feet) lower to the ground, an alarm says \"Terrain -- pull up!\" \"Open the damn door!\" the pilot says. It's 10:38, and the plane is at 4,000 meters (about 13,000 feet). Lubitz's breathing can still be heard on the voice recorder, according to Bild's report. Two minutes later, investigators think they hear the plane's right wing scrape a mountaintop. Screams can be heard one final time. Cockpit recordings are some of the most sensitive and closely held parts of aviation crash investigations. They're never officially released, according to CNN aviation reporter Richard Quest. Quest called it \"unbelievable\" that the black box audio would be leaked in this manner. Communications between air traffic control and a plane's cockpit can be downloaded privately, but that's less common in Europe than it is in the United States. An edited and redacted version of the transcript is usually published in part of a final report on an incident. Although search teams have recovered the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder remains missing. That device could reveal crucial details about what happened during the final moments of the flight. Jean Pierre Michel, lead investigator for the French inquiry, said on Saturday that investigators are not ruling out any scenario with respect to the crash out at this point. But French authorities have said that Lubitz appeared to have crashed Germanwings Flight 9525 deliberately into the Alps on Tuesday as it flew from Barcelona, Spain, toward Dusseldorf, Germany, with 150 people on board. Much attention has focused on Lubitz's state of mind since then, with suggestions that he may have had mental health issues. Lubitz, 27, passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014, a German aviation source told CNN. An official with Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, said that the exam only tests physical health, not psychological health. The official also said that the company was never given any indication Lubitz was depressed, and that if he went to a doctor on his own, he would have been required to self-report if deemed unfit to fly. A Dusseldorf clinic said he'd gone there twice, most recently on March 10, \"concerning a diagnosis.\" But the University Clinic said it had not treated Lubitz for depression. The speculation about Lubitz' mental state is based on a letter found in a waste bin in his Dusseldorf apartment. The note, which was \"slashed,\" said Lubitz was not able to do his job, city prosecutor Christoph Kumpa said Friday. The fact that investigators found \"ripped, recent medical leave notes, including for the day of the offense, leads to the preliminary conclusion that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment,\" prosecutors said. Germanwings corroborated that assertion, saying it had never received a sick note from Lubitz. A handful of publications, citing unnamed sources, have reported that Lubitz suffered from various psychological maladies. CNN has not been able to confirm these reports. Lubitz suffered from \"generalized anxiety disorder,\" and from severe depression in the past, Le Parisien newspaper reported Sunday, citing sources close to the investigation. In 2010, Lubitz received injections of antipsychotic medication, the paper said. He was also prescribed a medication that influences neurotransmitters, but it's unclear when that happened, according to Le Parisien. The newspaper said investigators found a handful of pills in his apartment in addition to two sick notes, which forbade him from working from March 16 to March 29. The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported Friday that Lubitz suffered from mental illness and kept his diagnosis concealed from his employer. A subsequent report from the Times on Saturday, citing two officials with knowledge of the investigation, said Lubitz sought treatment before the crash for vision problems that might have put his career at risk.  However, an official with Lufthansa, said that if Lubitz had vision problems, they would have been discovered during his pilot recertification medical examination. Authorities have not ruled out the vision problems could have been psychosomatic, according to the Times. Citing an unidentified senior investigator, German newspaper Die Welt said that Lubitz suffered from a severe \"psychosomatic illness\" and that German police seized prescription drugs that treat the condition. Lubitz suffered from a \"severe subjective burnout syndrome\" and from severe depression, the source told the newspaper. News reports also stated that antidepressants were found during the search of his apartment. Investigators are expected to question his relatives, friends and co-workers as they try to pin down what could have prompted the co-pilot to steer a jetliner full of people into a mountainside. Lubitz had a girlfriend, a teacher at a school in Dusseldorf not far from his apartment, according to German media. Who was co-pilot Andreas Lubitz? Dozens of people attended a remembrance ceremony Saturday for the victims of the crash at a church in a nearby town, Digne-les-Bains, France. Most of the people on the plane were from Germany and Spain. Relatives of the victims and local residents also gathered Saturday afternoon by a simple stone memorial set up near the crash site, in the village of Le Vernet. Flowers have been laid there, in the shadow of the snow-covered peaks of the French Alps. The mayor of one local community said he had seen Lubitz's father on Thursday evening, describing him as \"a man in deep distress.\" \"We get the impression that that man is bearing the whole weight of the disaster on his shoulders,\" Bernard Bartolini, the mayor of Prads-Haute-Bleone, said Saturday. \"I can tell that this is a man whose life is totally broken,\" Bartolini said. \"He had so much emotion in him.\" CNN's Steve Almasy, Laura Smith-Spark, Frederik Pleitgen, Sandrine Amiel, Jethro Mullen, Lynn Franco, Margot Haddad and Tim Lister contributed to this report.","highlights":"France's accident investigation agency, BEA, \"dismayed\" by the voice recording leak .\nGerman newspaper Bild releases a timeline of the flight's final moments .\nAndreas Lubitz suffered from \"generalized anxiety disorder,\" and from severe depression in the past, Le Parisien newspaper reports ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson is about to be out of a job. Jackson and city officials in the St. Louis suburb have announced his resignation, effective March 19. It's the latest fallout after a Justice Department investigation slammed his department's tactics. Speculation has swirled for months that Jackson would step down, and critics have pointed to several key points as signs that the police chief was in hot water. Here's a look at some key moments leading up to his resignation: . A police officer shoots and kills Michael Brown, an unarmed African-American teen. The incident exposes feelings of distrust between Ferguson's black community and its Police Department, which is overwhelmingly white. Anger begins to simmer on that first day, when Brown's body isn't removed from the street for four hours. Protests erupt. Among demonstrators' demands: that the Police Department release the name of the officer who shot Brown. Jackson reveals the name of the officer who shot Brown, Darren Wilson. On that same day, the department releases surveillance video that he says shows Brown robbing a store. Jackson says he distributed the store videotape \"because the press asked for it,\" noting he couldn't withhold it indefinitely. The chief adds, \"we needed to release that at the same time we needed to release the name of the officer involved in the shooting,\" though he doesn't elaborate on why . Critics accuse him of inflaming tensions rather than getting the situation under control. In a YouTube video, Jackson apologizes to Brown's parents. \"I'm truly sorry for the loss of your son. I'm also sorry that it took so long to remove Michael from the street,\" he said during his video statement. Investigators were doing \"important work\" trying to uncover the truth and collect evidence during those four hours, Jackson said, but \"it was just too long, and I'm truly sorry for that.\" \"Overnight I went from being a small-town police chief to being part of a conversation about racism, equality and the role of policing in that conversation,\" he says in the video. \"As chief of police, I want to be part of that conversation. I also want to be part of the solution.\" That night, he meets with protesters, agreeing to march with them. But even that meeting turns ugly; a scuffle breaks out and arrests are made. Jackson tells CNN's Erin Burnett he plans to stay in his job as police chief. \"I intend to see this thing through. And I've been working with a lot of community members to work on some progressive changes that will bring the community together and to open up dialogue and getting us all talking about serious issues and actually creating solutions to problems,\" he says. \"So, yes, I think I can -- I think I can see this through and come out on the other side with the community, the region and even the country a whole lot better.\" The Justice Department slams the Ferguson Police Department for tactics that federal investigators say targeted African-Americans. Investigators also find evidence of racist jokes being sent around by Ferguson police and court officials. Asked about his reaction to the report by CNN's Sara Sidner, Jackson keeps mum, saying that he needs to analyze it further before he comments. Asked what he'll do in response, he says he will \"take action as necessary.\" The city says it has reached a deal for the police chief to resign, effective March 19. Jackson confirms his resignation in a letter, saying \"it is with profound sadness that I am announcing I am stepping down.\" In a text message response to CNN, Jackson says, \"It's a really hard pill to swallow.\" CNN's Sara Sidner, Eliott C. McLaughlin, Dana Ford and Jason Carroll contributed to this report.","highlights":"Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson says he's stepping down .\nCritics accused him of raising tensions rather than calming the situation .\nJackson defended his department and vowed to work with the community ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Thirty years ago, a journey across Europe meant a passport full of stamps, a wallet full of different currencies and plenty of time spent waiting in line to be glared at by border officials. That all began to change in June 1985, when the continent's countries began signing up to the Schengen agreement -- a deal that lifted frontier controls between cooperating neighbors. Today, 20 years after it came into force, with more than 26 states now participating, Schengen has completely altered the experience of traversing Europe. Nowhere is this more visible than at the old crossing points -- places that were once hives of activity but are now ghostly, vacated shells of their former selves. Not entirely forgotten though. Spanish photographer Ignacio Evangelista spent several years criss-crossing the continent to capture these abandoned checkpoints on camera for a project he calls \"After Schengen.\" The result is a fascinating gallery of images that charts the unusual architecture of places whose fate has been intertwined with Europe's ever-evolving political and economic allegiances. \"I don't know why but from many years ago, I feel very attracted to situations or places where the natural and the artificial come together, sometimes a little bit in conflict,\" Evangelista tells CNN, explaining his interest in frontiers. He says he spent his formative years poring over the World Atlas, marveling at the straight-line borders carved by colonialists across the map of Africa and wondering why Europeans couldn't iron the kinks out of their own squiggled frontiers. \"When you are a young child in front of a map you feel ... you have the whole world in front of you and you can travel with your mind of course, with your imagination,\" he says. As a young adult in the early 1990s, Evangelista experienced many of these borders firsthand when he embarked on an Interailing trip -- a country-hopping rite of passage that sees many young Europeans take advantage of cheap pan-continental train tickets. \"Before, when I was young, if you traveled from Spain to Germany you had to cross three countries and take three currencies,\" he recalls. \"Once I was traveling with my friend, Interailing ... from Italy to Greece, we had to cross the old Yugoslavia. \"I think into the night,  2 or 3 a.m.,  we cross the border from Italy into Yugoslavia and the train stopped. We were sleeping, of course. Then three or four soldiers come into the train and shouted at everybody, very aggressively, like in a spy movie. \"We waited half an hour, then half an hour later the train went on. It was exciting, even funny as I was 18 years old, but now it's not so funny.\" As Evangelista points out, in a Europe cleaved by the Cold War, many borders were not just the cultural dividing lines they are today. Back then they were fortifications demarcating places of oppression and freedom. The checkpoints themselves were sometimes places of fear, of hostile bureaucracy -- a past Evangelista says lingers on in the buildings left behind. \"For me it's fascinating because you can see the passage of the time, the human footprint. \"These places had a very strong coercive role, people had to stop the car and the policeman had to ask you who you are, you showed your passport, maybe you had to open your bags. The police had the power to not let you go on. \"It's interesting to me, looking at these places now they are a little bit spooky, because at most of them you can feel this ghostly atmosphere.\" The frontier buildings range in size and style, from giant Soviet declarations of authority that loom over major highways to tiny huts in deep, dark forests. Europe's richer countries tend to maintain old posts, while less wealthier states seem content to let them deteriorate, Evangelista says. Some, he says, are gone completely, marked only on maps and located using GPS trackers or by talking to locals. A strong supporter for an open Europe at a time when some of the continent's nations are talking about severing the close economic and political bonds they share with their neighbors, Evangelista recalls one encounter that underscored the human side to his project. While setting up his camera at a checkpoint on the Austria-Hungary frontier, he watched as a man drove in from the Austrian side and parked, followed by a woman, two minutes later, from the Hungarian side. \"They began to speak and they were kissing very much. After 10 minutes they went back their separate ways, and I thought, before the Schengen agreement, this couple had no future.\" Follow Evangelista's ongoing project at www.ignacioevangelista.com .","highlights":"Spanish photographer Ignacio Evangelista's \"After Schengen\" project captures images of abandoned European checkpoints .\nSchengen agreement came into force 20 years ago, lifting border controls between participating European nations .\nBorder checkpoints range from giant Soviet statements to small huts in deep, dark forests ."}
{"article":"Boston (CNN)Bill Richard knew his son wasn't going to make it. But the father of three told his wife he couldn't stay by 8-year-old Martin's side. The boy's body was torn apart by an explosion near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. His skin had changed color. A crowd hovered over him, frantically trying to help, but he was dying. Speaking from the witness stand at Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's trial on Thursday, Richard told jurors he was faced with a heartbreaking choice. \"I knew in my head that I needed to act quickly, or we might not only lose Martin,\" he said. \"We might lose Jane, too.\" Moments after the blast, Richard had stumbled toward Jane, his 7-year-old daughter. His pants and sneakers were torn apart. His legs felt like they were on fire. He could barely hear. And the air smelled \"vile,\" he said, like gunpowder, sulfur and burned hair. But he soon realized the situation was much worse for his daughter. \"She tried to get up and she fell. That was when I noticed her leg,\" he said. \"She didn't have it. It was blown off.\" So Richard left one son to die near the marathon finish line, and shielded his other son's eyes from the carnage as they raced to the hospital, hoping that doctors could save his daughter's life. \"It was,\" Richard said Thursday, \"the last time I saw my son alive -- barely.\" Richard's description of the explosion's horrifying aftermath capped a day of dramatic testimony as survivors shared their stories in the second day of the high-profile trial. Tsarnaev's attorneys admit that he carried out the 2013 attacks, which killed three people and injured more than 260 others at the marathon. A fourth person, an MIT police officer, was ambushed and killed in his patrol car three days after the bombings as Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, allegedly ran from police. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed after a gunbattle with police. And now, his younger brother sits in court facing 30 federal charges related to the bombings. His attorneys say he was influenced by his slain brother to participate in the attacks. They argued Thursday that now isn't the right time for jurors to hear the string of harrowing stories from survivors of the explosions, arguing that testimony should be part of a later phase of the trial, when jurors will decide what penalty Tsarnaev should face. But the judge sided with prosecutors, who argued the testimony was necessary to support their indictment. On Thursday, jurors relived the moments after the marathon bombings through the eyes of some of the people most affected by the blasts. Defense attorneys didn't ask them any questions. Jeff Bauman was suspicious as soon as he noticed a black backpack on the ground near the finish line. \"I thought it was weird,\" he said Thursday. \"If you are at the airport, if you see any unattended luggage, you notify authorities.\" But this was Boston, he thought, where stuff like that doesn't happen. Still, he told a friend they should move. An explosion came two seconds later. \"I saw a flash, heard like three pops and I was on the ground,\" Bauman said from the witness stand Thursday. \"At first I opened my eyes and saw the sky. The first thought was, that was a big firework.\" Bauman's ears were ringing, and everything was muffled, but he heard the screams. The first bomb had exploded. \"I looked down and saw my legs, and it was pure carnage,\" he told jurors. \"I could see my bone.\" Bauman testified about becoming aware of his injuries -- burns, wounds on his back, and his legs. \"I knew my legs were gone. I know that instantly,\" he said. He kept repeating to himself, \"This is messed up, this is messed up, this is messed up.\" Then the second explosion. \"We are under attack,\" he thought to himself. All he wanted to do was call his mom. When Boston Police Officer Lauren Woods saw people running by, screaming, she ran against the grain, toward Boylston Street, the last leg on the marathon route. One of the first victims Woods came across was Lu Lingzi, a graduate student at Boston University. Lu was vomiting profusely, Woods recalled Thursday. Others were already performing CPR on her, and the officer attempted to clear Lu's airway. \"I smelled the residue of smoke,\" Woods said. \"Smelled like fireworks, cannons.\" Paramedics arrived, and eventually told Woods the young woman was not going to make it and they had to move on to other people. Lu became one of the three fatalities at the scene. It smelled like gunpowder, Alan Hern told the jury, and \"kind of felt like we were underwater.\" Hern's wife -- who was pregnant -- was running the race. He found her uninjured, but hysterical from the explosions and ensuing chaos, he said. There were powder marks on her jacket. Hern, a high school football coach, then went searching for his 11-year-old son, Aaron. A figure covered in black soot and hair standing straight up caught Hern's eye, and he knew it was Aaron, he testified. His son's left thigh was cratered, mangled flesh and blood, Hern said. \"It was like something you'd see in a war movie,\" he said. \"His eyebrows were singed and his hair was sticking straight up.\" Another of Thursday's witnesses, Roseann Sdoia, also referred to it as something out of a movie. Before she hit the ground from the blast, she said, it registered in her mind that she had lost her leg. \"When I looked down, my leg was tucked under me, but blood was pouring out,\" she told jurors. In front of her lay a socked foot. She started thinking -- Did I wear socks today? She decided she hadn't worn socks that day. It was someone else's foot. \"It was almost like I was starring in a horror movie,\" she said, \"as was everybody else around me.\" Doctors had to amputate her leg below the knee. Traveling from the marathon finish line to the hospital, Bill Richard went from one terrifying scene to another. \"You know it's not going to be good when you see the look of horror on doctors' faces,\" he told the court Thursday. \"Jane was devastatingly injured.\" Doctors amputated her left leg below the knee and removed more than 20 shrapnel pieces from her body, he said. Richard soon learned that, as he'd feared, Martin didn't survive the bombing. His wife, Denise, was also hospitalized after the attack. She lost sight in one eye. The father said his own injuries were much less severe than the wounds many other victims suffered. The ringing in his ears never stops, and he lost some of his hearing. But Richard said he could still hear the lawyer questioning him at Thursday's trial. He can still hear music. And the most important thing. \"I can still hear,\" he said, \"the beautiful voices of my family.\"\u200b . CNN's Ann O'Neill reported from Boston. Mariano Castillo and Catherine E. Shoichet wrote the story in Atlanta.","highlights":"Father describes the moment when he realized 8-year-old Martin Richard wouldn't survive .\nThe second day of the Boston Marathon bombings trial is underway .\nSurvivor Jeff Bauman recounts how he lost his legs in the attack ."}

On Tuesday, a man convicted of blinding another man in an acid attack was himself forcibly blinded in one eye, according to Amnesty International and Tasnim News, a semi-official news website. The punishment is believed to be Iran's first case of Qasas, meaning retribution in kind, Tasnim News said. Amnesty International denounced the sentence. \"This punishment exposes the utter brutality of Iran's justice system and underlines the Iranian authorities' shocking disregard for basic humanity,\"  said Raha Bahreini, Amnesty International's Iran researcher. \"Meting out cruel and inhuman retribution punishments is not justice. Blinding, like stoning, amputation and flogging, is a form of corporal punishment prohibited by international law. Such punishments should not be carried out under any circumstances.\" The acid attacker had been hired by the victim's wife to throw acid in his face, Tasnim News said. Amnesty International said the attack occurred in 2009 in the city of Qom. The defendant was blinded in his left eye at Rajai Shahr Prison, but the blinding of his right eye was postponed, Amnesty International said. The man was ordered to pay \"blood money\" and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Amnesty International said punishment has been delayed for another Iranian man in a \"retribution in kind\" case.

{"article":"(CNN)It turns out that Jupiter may be more than just an enormous ball of gas spinning a few hundred million miles farther out in the solar system. We earthlings might have the giant planet to thank for our very existence. Two scientists are suggesting that the inner solar system once played host to a bunch of \"super-Earths\" -- planets that were larger than our own but smaller than Neptune. Jupiter, however, put an end to those early occupiers of the inner orbits, bulldozing in and sweeping them into the sun, according to a paper published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Jupiter's epic, planet-shattering journey toward the sun and back out again laid the foundations for the creation of Earth and the other smaller planets nearby -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. \"Our work suggests that Jupiter's inward-outward migration could have destroyed a first generation of planets and set the stage for the formation of the mass-depleted terrestrial planets that our solar system has today,\" said Konstantin Batygin of Caltech, one of the authors of the paper. The theory attempts to explain why our solar system is a bit of an oddball in our galactic neighborhood. Most other systems that have planets orbiting around a star similar to our sun look very different. They generally have at least one planet significantly larger than Earth that's in a closer orbit than Mercury's. But they don't have many objects farther out. Maybe that's because of Jupiter's destructive romp in the early history of the solar system. \"There is no reason to think that the dominant mode of planet formation throughout the galaxy should not have occurred here,\" Batygin said. \"It is more likely that subsequent changes have altered its original makeup.\" He and his co-author -- Gregory Laughlin of University of California, Santa Cruz -- are building on a scenario of Jupiter's migration that was previously put forward by other scientists. Known as the Grand Tack scenario, it describes Jupiter getting drawn toward the sun in the early era of the solar system thanks to its huge mass. What stops it from being sucked right into the sun is Saturn. The two gas giants start to exert gravitational influence on one another, entering a planetary dance that eventually sends them back farther out into the solar system. Batygin and Laughlin suggest that during its inward journey, Jupiter dragged a load of planetary building blocks, known as planetesimals, along with it. That sent the planetesimals smashing into debris in the inner solar system, causing them to break apart and fall into the sun at a faster rate. The scientists say they ran a simulation of what would happen if there were also a number of super-Earths in the vicinity as well. They found that a wave of decaying planetesimals would steer the super-Earths into the sun over the course of 20,000 years. \"It's a very effective physical process,\" Batygin said. \"You only need a few Earth masses worth of material to drive tens of Earth masses worth of planets into the sun.\" On its way back out, Jupiter left some remaining planetesimals in its wake -- the building blocks that over millions of years would come to form Earth, Mercury, Venus and Mars.","highlights":"Scientists: An epic migration by Jupiter led to destruction of \"super-Earths\"\nThe planet-shattering journey laid foundations for Earth, they say ."}

Yet it could have been a lot worse for the BT Sport pundit when you compare it to others that suffered similar fates when presenting by the pitch. Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown was victim to a flying ball during his punditry duty at the Emirates in 2012, and even manager Harry Redknapp fell foul during a training session. Paul Scholes discovered the perils of reporting on the touchline at St James' Park on Wednesday night . Scholes reacts after the ball hits him during the warm-up for Newcastle vs Manchester United . Redknapp reacted furiously during a television interview when a ball hit the then-Portsmouth manager as he shouted: 'How can you kick that over here? You try kicking it in the goal and you hit me? 'Got to get some f****** brains, haven't you? No wonder he's in the f****** reserves.' Speaking with FourFourTwo in 2003, he refused to name which player he was yelling at: 'I mustn't tell you the name of the player. It wouldn't be fair. He was on shooting practice and I was standing at the corner flag when the ball hit me \u2013 that tells you everything.' At least that wasn't in front of an audience like Sportsmail's unfortunate columnist in January 2012. Arsenal legend Keown got smacked in the face while on duty for ESPN\u00a0by a stray ball during the warm-up for an FA Cup match at the Emirates where Leeds United were the visitors. Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown is smacked by the ball during the warm-up for Arsenal vs Leeds United . The Arsenal legend is hit as he is asked a question during his punditry duty for ESPN in January 2012 . Keown was hit by a stray ball during the warm-up but joked about it in his column for the Daily Mail later . Writing in his column for the Daily Mail\u00a0days later, Keown joked about the incident: 'It was a former Spurs man who you may have seen hit me with the ball while I was on-air on Monday night. 'Alex Bruce tipped me off that his Leeds team-mate Michael Brown \u2013 the ex-Tottenham midfielder \u2013 was the culprit. At least he was apparently trying to aim at Robbie Savage, not me.' Over to Germany, where SkySports reporter Jessica Kastrop was smacked in the back of the head by a stray shot from\u00a0former Chelsea player Khalid Boulahrouz in 2010. The footage shows the ball getting closer and closer to its victim until it knocks her forward. Kastrop said afterwards: 'I was fine eventually. Boulahrouz ran over to me straight away and apologised.' What about in other sports? American football has its moments, too, such as when Fox reporter Pam Oliver was hit by a Chandler Harnish throw.

{"article":"(CNN)Students en route to Yangon, Myanmar, to protest an education bill were met with violence from police Tuesday, according to multiple media reports and international watch groups. \"We all watched while a young man was beaten extremely hard and repeatedly by about three or four policemen in heavy riot gear,\" U Zarni, a spokesman for the Cooperative Committee for Trade Unions, told CNN. Students are seeking changes to an education bill that they say limits academic freedom and have been in negotiations with authorities, but these have been curbed because of the crackdown. The violence Tuesday occurred in Letpadan, a town of about 145 kilometers (90 miles) north of Yangon, the nation's largest city. The students' march began in Mandalay, about 640 kilometers (400 miles) north of Yangon. Zarni said the students had been \"given the red light\" on proceeding to Yangon. \"They had decided they would drive into the city, meet with other students there for 15 minutes of talks and then disperse,\" Zarni said. \"But within about an hour of being given this information, they were told that wasn't the case.\" \"Some students decided they would try, thinking the police would just take them away, but the police were so brutal.\" Police arrested about 40 to 50 people, according to Zarni. \"They broke a reporter's camera and cheered about it. They hit women. They hit monks who were also there. They went into the monastery and detained everyone who had run to hide in there,\" Zarni said. Human rights issues have been at the forefront in Myanmar, also known as Burma, as the country emerges from decades of authoritarian military rule, with elections planned for late this year. \"The public and we are losing confidence in the democratic transitions,\" Zarni said. Khin Lay, director of the Triangle Women Support Group, agreed. \"Students, human rights, women's rights -- we're all extremely angry about the way we have been treated over the years,\" said Lay. \"But we've been waiting for the 2015 elections with patience because we believe in the democracy movement, and we're hoping that we have the opportunity to exercise our right to vote.

{"article":"(CNN)Empathy. Confidence. Passion. These are the traits the next police chief in Ferguson, Missouri, will need to shrink the ocean of distrust between community and police. So says Cecil Smith. And maybe he should know. Smith is the police chief in Sanford, Florida, another community rocked by racial tensions and poor police-community relations after the high-profile shooting of a black teenager -- the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin. And if Smith's experience is any guide, it will take \"a lot of prayer and a little goading\" to convince someone to step into the job vacated this week by Chief Thomas Jackson. \"That community, as we see, has been hurting and struggling for some time now,\" he says. And how: . -- The community remains deeply scarred by the events last year, after the August shooting death of unarmed African-American teenager Michael Brown by a white Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson, and the November decision by the St. Louis County Grand Jury not to charge Wilson, who later resigned. Occasionally violent protests and sometimes heavy-handed responses by police deepened divisions and distrust. -- The police department was already groaning under the epic weight of months of nearly constant protest and last week's release of a damning Department of Justice report that found evidence of discriminatory conduct on the part of Ferguson officials. -- Add to that the obvious fears facing officers following the shooting early Thursday of two police officers only hours after Jackson resigned. The decision for Jackson to step aside was a mutual one between the chief and city, Mayor James Knowles told reporters. He'll get severance and a year of health insurance and will turn the reins over to Ferguson police Lt. Col Al Eickhoff next week. The city will launch a nationwide search for a permanent replacement, Knowles said. \"The City of Ferguson looks to become an example of how a community can move forward in the face of adversity.  We are committed to keeping our police department and having one that exhibits the highest degree of professionalism and fairness,\" said Knowles -- who has himself been targeted by protesters demanding he resign. To get there, it might look to Sanford for guidance. There, trust in the police department bottomed out in the aftermath of the Trayvon Martin shooting. While no police officers were involved in the shooting, anger over their perceived failure to arrest the teenager's killer, George Zimmerman, pushed relations in the community to a boiling point, eventually resulting in the firing of Chief Bill Lee. Zimmerman eventually was arrested, and a jury acquitted him. Smith watched the chaos play out from Elgin, Illinois, where he was deputy police chief. A former boss in Illinois suggested he look at the job, so he traveled to Florida on his own time, getting to know the community and learning what divided residents and police. He still isn't sure how to explain why he took the job. \"The first year, I was still wondering, was it a smart move?\" Smith joked. But things are better now, he says. After taking the job, Smith made it a point of spending time \"walking and talking\" in Sanford, building relationships with community leaders and everyday residents. Inside the department, stepped up training in engagement and ethical policing. He also stepped up recruitment of African-American officers. \"One of the things that's going on is we don't have people who look like us in the community,\" said Smith, himself an African-American. He handed out long-delayed promotions. And he even presided over a makeover, enlisting officers to help choose new uniforms. The new chief in Ferguson will likely need to do some of the same things, Smith says. Community leaders and other officials agree. \"We need to deal with the culture issue here to make sure whoever is coming in behind Chief Jackson is not a new face and a new name on the same type of issues,\" Patricia Bynes, a Democratic committeewoman for Ferguson Township,\" told CNN Wednesday. \"We need to seriously deal with the culture of the police department and the municipal courts and the way the city is run.\" New York police Commissioner William Bratton said there are two issues confronting the heads of police forces. There is the lack of trust on the community's part and the lack of confidence some officers have in their leadership. On the first issue, he said: \"You need to be willing to embrace that there is a need to change.\" To police leadership consultant John Vanek, whoever takes over the Ferguson department will need to have the same leadership traits valued in boardrooms across the world -- the ability to form partnerships across organizational lines, to think differently, to turn failure into success and to do it all in a harsh media spotlight. But that's easier said than done. \"There's going to be a lot of hostility in Ferguson for a long time,\" he said. So will the new chief need to be African-American to help defuse the racial tensions roiling the city? Here's the politic answer: Find the right candidate, regardless of race. \"You want to find the best candidate to be police chief,\" said attorney Benjamin Crump, who has represented the families of both Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown.  \"But diversity is very important. It's very important that the police officers understand the communities, at least want to engage with members of the community they are going to be protecting and serving.\" \"There's an old saying in the black community that everybody else is protected and served but we are policed,\" Crump said. \"We don't want to be policed. We want to be protected and served as any American citizen.\" CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","highlights":"NYPD commissioner: Chiefs need to embrace need for change .\nFerguson might look to Sanford, Florida's experience when choosing a new chief .\nThat city also had to find ways to heal divisions between community and police ."}

Police have said singer-songwriter David Crosby hit a jogger with his car Sunday evening in Santa Ynez, California, near where the Hall of Fame musician lives. On Tuesday the highway patrol released two 911 calls from the incident in which the frantic caller pleads for medical help for the man. The operator tells him the highway patrol is on the way. He asks the caller if the person is walking. The caller says he didn't see the man because of the setting sun and again worries about medical assistance. \"I need an ambulance, man. Ambulance. Fast,\" the man tells 911. They're on the way, he's told as the call disconnects. Later, Crosby calls back, worried that the ambulance was not there yet. \"We need the ambulance now. This guy is hurt,\" the caller says. Another 911 dispatcher tells him the ambulance is already en route and transfers him to a medical services dispatcher. Crosby was driving at approximately 50 mph when he struck the jogger, California Highway Patrol Spokesman Don Clotworthy said Monday. The posted speed limit was 55. The jogger, identified as Jose LuQuin Jimenez,  was in fair condition Tuesday, a spokesman for Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital said. The man suffered multiple fractures, Clotworthy said earlier. \"Mr. Crosby was cooperative with authorities and he was not impaired or intoxicated in any way,\" said Clotworthy. According to the spokesman, the jogger and Crosby were on the same side of the road. Pedestrians are supposed to be on the left side of the road walking toward traffic, Clotworthy said. Joggers are considered pedestrians. Crosby is known for weaving multilayered harmonies over sweet melodies. He is part of the celebrated rock group Crosby, Stills & Nash, and was also a member of the Byrds. \"David Crosby is obviously very upset that he accidentally hit anyone.

{"article":"(CNN)The FBI has increased its reward for information on missing American Robert Levinson from $1 million to $5 million, it announced Monday. Levinson, a retired FBI agent, vanished after traveling to the Iranian island of Kish in March 2007 and is one of the longest-held U.S. citizens in history. The FBI announced the reward increase on the eighth anniversary of Levinson's disappearance -- and the day before his 67th birthday. \"Levinson traveled to Kish Island, Iran, on March 8, 2007, working on behalf of several large corporations, and his whereabouts, well-being and the circumstances surrounding his disappearance have been unknown since that time,\" it said in a statement. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry issued a statement asking Iran to cooperate with the investigation into Levinson's whereabouts. \"He has spent more than 2,900 days separated from those who love him, and is one of the longest held U.S. citizens in history. Year after year, the family has endured the pain of his absence. It is time for him to come home,\" Kerry said. \"We remain committed to the safe return of Mr. Levinson to his family and appreciate the support and assistance from our international partners. We remain concerned about Mr. Levinson's health given his age and the length of his disappearance.\" Iran's government repeatedly has said it is not holding Levinson and does not know his whereabouts. The FBI says he was in Iran as a private investigator. But news reports in 2013 said he was working as an independent CIA contractor when he disappeared. That prompted his family to speak out, saying they kept it quiet for years that Levinson was working for the CIA, because the U.S. government had warned them that revealing it would put him in more jeopardy. The FBI, White House and CIA have not publicly acknowledged any connection between the CIA and Levinson. It's unclear exactly who is holding him, but U.S. officials have said they believe he is somewhere in southwest Asia. Whoever his captors are, in 2010 they sent a \"proof of life\" videotape and photographs of Levinson to his family. In the video, he asked the U.S. government for help: \"Please help me get home,\" a gaunt-looking Levinson said on the tape, citing his 33 years of service in the FBI as a reason for that help. The photographs showed him with a large beard.","highlights":"The FBI says it is increasing the reward for missing American Robert Levinson to $5 million .\nLevinson, a former FBI agent, went missing in Iran eight years ago; Iran says it does not know where he is .\nSecretary of State John Kerry has issued a statement asking for Iran to cooperate in the search for Levinson ."}
{"article":"Selma, Alabama (CNN)In a passionate speech about racial progress in America, President Barack Obama on Saturday told thousands of people who gathered here to commemorate the 50th anniversary of \"Bloody Sunday\" that \"our march is not yet finished. But we are getting closer.\" Obama emphasized that a day of commemoration is not enough to repay the debt paid by the marchers who were brutally beaten 50 years ago as they demonstrated for voting rights. \"If Selma taught us anything, it's that our work is never done,\" the President said near Edmund Pettus Bridge, where the confrontation between authorities and marchers was captured in film and photographs that jolted the nation. Read President Obama's prepared remarks . The President said that what civil rights marchers did years ago \"will reverberate through the ages. Not because the change they won was preordained; not because their victory was complete; but because they proved that nonviolent change is possible; that love and hope can conquer hate.\" He hailed the marchers as heroes. The President said that \"the Americans who crossed this bridge, they were not physically imposing, but they gave courage to millions. They held no elected office. But they led a nation.\" The \"Bloody Sunday\" anniversary marks 50 years from the day hundreds of people were brutally attacked by Alabama state troopers as they marched from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, to protest racial discrimination in voter registration. About 600 people participated in the planned 50-mile journey on March 7, 1965. The marchers were protesting discrimination that kept black people from voting. But as the marchers approached the foot of the bridge, state troopers used force and tear gas to push them back. As events were underway Saturday in Selma, hundreds of people marched across the Brooklyn Bridge in New York to symbolize their unity with the Alabama commemoration. Television coverage of the event in 1965 triggered national outrage and eventually led Congress to pass the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, which mandated federal oversight over elections in states with histories of discrimination. 50 years later: Memories from 'Bloody Sunday' nurse . Many of the nation's leaders, activists and celebrities were in Selma on Saturday attending various activities taking place in memory of the historic event. On Saturday, Rep. John Lewis -- one of the demonstrators bloodied by troopers 50 years ago -- and nearly 100 other members of Congress from both parties joined the President  at the bridge in Selma -- a bridge that still bears the name of Pettus, a Confederate general who was also a Ku Klux Klan leader. \"We must use this moment to recommit ourselves to do all we can to finish this work. There's still work to be done,\" said Lewis, adding this is an opportunity to \"redeem the soul of America.\" The President said that though progress has been made, racism is still too prevalent in America. \"We just need to open our eyes, and ears, and hearts, to know that this nation's racial history still casts its long shadow upon us,\" he said.  \"We know the march is not yet over, the race is not yet won, and that reaching that blessed destination where we are judged by the content of our character -- requires admitting as much.\" The President called on Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act, first passed in 1965. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a key provision of the law that required certain states with a history of racial discrimination at the polls to \"pre-clear\" any changes to the law with the federal government before implementing them. Efforts to revive key provisions of the act have stalled in Congress. John Lewis's memories of the march . Reflecting a sense of change in the half century since Bloody Sunday, and with Selma again in a national media spotlight, the mood in the crowd Saturday was of unity, and talks were focused on how to move America forward. But some current Selma residents worried that after the dignitaries leave their town -- with a population 82% black and with more than 40% of its people living below the national poverty level -- will fade from view except for its historical significance. Many black residents of Selma say they still live in a divisive society and still feel the sting of racism, with true change yet to come. Geraldine Martin, 59, has lived in Selma all her life. She was 9 years old on \"Bloody Sunday\" and with her mother had just welcomed a little sister, Belinda, to the world on that day. The two sisters grew up in Selma less than a decade apart. They graduated from Selma High School and both had to make decisions about whether to stay in their hometown when few opportunities existed for young people. \"We need to reevaluate our education system,\" said Geraldine, who became a special education teacher at Selma High.  \"We need incentives for young people. I am hoping today's events will help us move forward.\" Opinion: Selma's historic bridge deserves a better name . Belinda shook her head. She left Selma after high school and now lives in Atlanta. Her view of Selma has changed over the years -- looking in from the outside. \"I don't see how Selma will move forward without togetherness,\" said Belinda. \"There is no diversity in Selma. People don't live together. \"I want to ask white people: 'So why are you so angry at us? Is it really the color of my skin or something deeper?'\" Maybe, she said, the attention on Selma this weekend will help spark a relevant dialogue. 50 years later: The house where MLK stayed .

{"article":"(CNN)Actress Taraji P. Henson is apologizing for claiming her son was racially profiled during a traffic stop in Southern California last year. The Glendale Police Department released dash cam video of the encounter Friday, which contradicted her son's claims. Police released the footage after Henson commented about the alleged profiling in  an Uptown Magazine interview published last month. In her interview, the star of the hit television show \"Empire\" said her son, Marcell Johnson, 20, was racially profiled in Glendale  and at the University of Southern California, where she accused campus police of stopping him for \"having his hands in his pockets.\" After her son's claim, she vowed to send him to Howard University in Washington instead. \"I'm not paying $50K so I can't sleep at night wondering is this the night my son is getting racially profiled on campus,\" she said. Even the University of Southern California stepped in, with its public safety director, John Thomas, saying he was disturbed by the report of the profiling, and was investigating it further. \"We encourage reporting of allegations of bias and I hope for the opportunity to have a conversation with the young man and his mother,\" Thomas said. But Henson retracted her accusations Friday,  and publicly apologized to the Glendale Police Department. \"A mother's job is not easy and neither is a police officer's,\" she said  in a post on Instagram.  \"Sometimes as humans we overreact without gathering all of the facts.  As a mother in this case I overreacted and for that I apologize.  Thank you to that officer for being kind to my son.\" Police Chief Robert Castro said his agency researched the traffic stop after her comments to the magazine. The incident started when a Glendale officer pulled over Johnson in October for failing to yield to a pedestrian at a cross walk. During the traffic stop, Johnson admitted to having marijuana, an infraction and Ritalin without a prescription, a felony, according to Castro. He consented to a search of the vehicle, and officers found marijuana, honey oil (concentrated marijuana), a marijuana grinder and a knife, Castro said.  Johnson was not driving while impaired and was only cited for possession of marijuana, he said. \"Misinformation that was reported in the story in Uptown Magazine with Taraji P. Henson impairs and weakens the relationships between law enforcement and the communities,\" Castro said. The Glendale Police Department said Friday it appreciated Henson's apology and is sharing it with its officers.","highlights":"Glendale authorities release dash cam video of the encounter .\nIt contradicts her son's claims ."}

He was 91. Lee passed away peacefully at Singapore General Hospital at 3:18 a.m., the statement said. He had been in the hospital with pneumonia since February 5. Born in 1923, Lee co-founded the city state in 1965 when it declared its independence from Malaysia and was its prime minister for more than three decades. \"The first of our founding fathers is no more,\" Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is Lee's son,  told the nation in a televised speech Monday. \"He fought for our independence, built a nation where there was none and made us proud to be Singaporeans,\" Lee said. Building up Singapore was his passion, the Prime Minister said, reading out a quote from his father:  \"At the end of the day what have I got? A successful Singapore. What have I given up? My life.\" Lee's body will lie in state at Parliament House from Wednesday through Saturday.  A state funeral will be held Sunday. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon issued a condolence statement and said Lee \"helped Singapore to transition from a developing country to one of the most developed in the world, transforming it into a thriving international business hub.\" President Obama called Lee a visionary who helped him formulate U.S. policy of \"rebalancing to the Asia Pacific,\" when the two met in Singapore in 2009. \"He was a true giant of history who will be remembered for generations to come as the father of modern Singapore and as one the great strategists of Asian affairs,\" the President said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry also praised the advice he got from Lee, calling it \"the most valuable and insightful I have received.\" \"He was, of course, a uniquely astute analyst and observer of Asia, and it is largely through his life's work that Singapore became one of the United States' strongest strategic partners in the region,\" Kerry said. Former President George H. W. Bush said he respected Lee's effective leadership of a \"wonderful, resilient and innovative country in ways that lifted living standards without indulging a culture of corruption.\" He added, \" Because of the example set by Lee Kuan Yew's singular leadership, I am confident that the future will be bright for Singapore.\" China's foreign ministry called Lee \"a uniquely influential Asian statesman,\" and Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott said \"our region owes much to Lee Kuan Yew.\" Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Indonesia's foreign ministry also praised Lee's leadership in their condolence notices. Singapore's President Tony Tan Keng Yam called Lee the \"architect of our modern Republic,\" in a letter to Lee's son, the current prime minister. \"Few have demonstrated such complete commitment to a cause greater than themselves,\" President Tan said.","highlights":"Lee Kuan Yew was the founding Prime Minister of Singapore .\nPresident Obama called him a \"true giant of history\""}

That's not a slight on Austin, who also would have impressed Hodgson. But when the England manager names his squad for the games against Lithuania and Italy on Thursday, in Kane he has a striker who has every hallmark of an international footballer. For Austin, the jury is still out. Kane was, essentially, the difference between the two teams at QPR. It wouldn't have come as surprise to Rangers boss Chris Ramsey, who played an influential role in nurturing the striker in the White Hart Lane academy. Spurs striker Kane celebrates as his goals keep Tottenham in the hunt for a top four finish . Rangers star Austin is denied from adding to his impressive goals tally by a save from Hugo Lloris . QPR striker Austin watches as his shot beats Lloris only to crash off the crossbar . 'He has polished himself, I was fortunate to have worked with him,' said Ramsey. 'Would I pick him for England? Yes, I would - but the way I'm going...' Two goals against QPR took his tally for the season to 26. That's a record you simply cannot ignore. Hodgson certainly won't. The only question for the England manager now is if he utilises the striker in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania or ease him in during the friendly against Italy. His first goal against Rangers showed great bravery, risking a hefty blow to the head to glance home Andros Townsend's free kick. His second showed great composure, skipping round Rob Green before finishing into an empty net. He ticks every box. But his goals only tell part of the story. Kane's heat map (right) in the opposition half showed he posed a greater threat than Austin (left) Twice he showed excellent vision to set up marauding right-back Kyle Walker with goal scoring opportunities, executing both passes with unerring accuracy. Had it not been for Green's heroics in Rangers' goal, Kane could easily have had four by the time Craig Pawson blew the final whistle.

On December 31, Delta Air Lines Flight 2566 from San Francisco to Minneapolis was diverted to Salt Lake City when a passenger went into labor during the flight. The woman was taken by the local fire department to the University of Utah Hospital, where she gave birth to a boy. US Airways requires passengers with a due date within seven days of flight to provide a doctor's certificate, dated within 72 hours of departure, \"stating that he or she has examined you and determined that you are fit to fly.\" If the mother on Tuesday's flight had been flying American Airlines, which owns US Airways, she might not have been able to travel. American hasn't created a single policy for both brands, and its policy is more restrictive. A medical certificate is required for travelers wishing to fly within four weeks of their delivery dates \"in a normal, uncomplicated pregnancy,\" according to the airline's website. She couldn't travel on domestic American flights of less than five hours within seven days before and after a the delivery date without a medical certificate and permission from the airline. Delta Air Lines doesn't restrict pregnant women from flying, but the airline doesn't waive ticket change fees and penalties for pregnancy. It recommends that pregnant travelers check with their doctors after the eighth month of pregnancy. Southwest Airlines recommends that female travelers consult with their doctors before traveling at any stage of pregnancy and warns specifically against air travel beginning at the 38th week of pregnancy. Southwest goes into even more detail. \"While air travel does not usually cause problems during pregnancy unless delivery is expected within 14 days or less, in some cases, traveling by air has been known to cause complications or premature labor. \"Depending on their physical condition, strength, and agility, pregnant women may, in some cases, be asked not to sit in the emergency exit row.\"","highlights":"A US Airways flight diverts to Greensboro for a passenger in labor .\nThe flight was originally from Philadelphia to Charlotte, North Carolina .\nMother and daughter are doing well in a Greensboro hospital ."}
{"article":"(CNN)They died in separate shootings. Separated by more than 2,000 miles, they lived with the peril and uncertainty that hundreds of thousands of U.S. law enforcement officers face each day. One was a 14-year veteran; the other a rookie on his first day out on his own. Two law enforcement officers, one in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, and another in San Jose, California, were shot and killed in encounters with suspects Tuesday. Such encounters are all too common. The number of law enforcement officers shot to death in the line of duty rose more than 50% last year, according to the Washington-based National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. \"Officers were obviously crying, grieving,\" said Officer Alberto Morales, a San Jose police department spokesman.\"They will do so for some time, as will many of us in the department.\" They were grieving for San Jose police Officer Michael Johnson, a veteran killed while responding to a report of a man threatening to kill himself, police said. The suspect in the San Jose shooting was found dead on his balcony with a gunshot wound, authorities said. Thousands of miles away, officers grieved the shooting death of Wisconsin State Trooper Trevor Casper, 21, of Kiel, according to the Wisconsin Professional Police Association. The suspect  -- a suspected bank robber -- was killed. Casper had successfully completely his field training recently. He was on his first solo assignment, Capt. Anthony Burrell told reporters Wednesday. It's unclear whether the suspects were fatally shot by law enforcement officers or died of self-inflicted gunshot wounds. Johnson, a veteran, was killed while responding to a report of a man threatening to kill himself, police said. Part of his job was to work with new officers. Police received a call Tuesday evening about a \"despondent, intoxicated man, who possibly had access to a weapon, including a rifle,\" said San Jose police Chief Larry Esquivel. When officers arrived at the scene, they were met with gunfire, said Esquivel, adding that investigators were still trying \"to understand what truly happened.\" Johnson was the first San Jose officer killed in the line of duty in 14 years. The last officer killed in the line of duty, Jeffrey Fontana, was in the same academy graduating class, Esquivel said. \"It's unfortunate for any of our officers to lose their lives, whether it's that class or any class,\" he said. It's not known whether the suspect was wounded in the exchange of gunfire, the police chief said. \"SJPD grieves as we offer our condolences to the family of our brother,\" the police department tweeted. Morales said the death had shaken many officers. \"Our hearts, prayers go out with the family of Michael, our brother. This is a very, very difficult time right now.\" He remembered Johnson's smile and bright eyes, how he was \"full of life and cared a lot about his job.\" \"It's a tough thing to relay to your fellow officers who have to go out there to continue to do this job,\" Morales said. \"But rest assured, that we will keep him in our memories as we go out there and continue to do the job that we love to do, and I'm sure he loved to do.\" In  Wisconsin, Casper was killed after chasing a bank robbery suspect in Fond du Lac, authorities said. He had been sworn in as a state trooper in December, according to media reports and a Facebook page dedicated to his memory. \"Trevor Casper was a lively young man,\" Burrell recalled. \"He was very excited about his opportunity to be a trooper... He always had a smile on his face. When we met several times, I always asked if he was having fun and his response was, 'I sure am,' with a smile on his face.\" Gunfire rang out when the trooper was pursuing a car that matched the description of one used in a bank robbery, CNN affiliate WITI-TV in Milwaukee reported. The suspect, identified as Steven Timothy Snyder, also died, according to the Wisconsin Department of Justice. No other details of the pursuit were available. Police believe the suspect may have shot and killed a man in his 60s after leaving the bank, the station reported. Authorities are not looking for any additional suspects. Lt. Col. Brian Rahn of the Wisconsin State Patrol said the rookie officer's handling of the fatal encounter was \"absolute textbook -- from the time he made contact with the vehicle until the event was over.\" The Wisconsin Department of Justice's Division of Criminal Investigation will conduct an investigation, a requirement for officer-involved shootings in the state. \"Our son Trevor was an amazing young man who from a young age would do anything to help anyone,\" the trooper's family said in a statement posted on Facebook. \"It did not surprise us when he selected a career in law enforcement. Even as a young child he was always helping others. Trevor had a soft and good heart. He truly believed his sole purpose in life was to serve and protect others.\" When his family asked Casper whether he was ready for a career as a trooper, \"Trevor proudly told us that he was 'born ready to do this job.' Trevor was so very proud of his career as a Wisconsin State Trooper. As a family we are so deeply honored that our son served as a law enforcement officer with the Wisconsin State Patrol and we share in their grief and loss. We are so deeply saddened by this loss and wish to thank everyone who has assisted us during this time,\" the statement added. The shooting occurred on the four-year anniversary of the death of Fond du Lac police Officer Craig Birkholz, who was shot and killed during a standoff with a suspect, WITI reported. \"Our hearts go out to his fellow officers, his friends, and especially his family,\" said a statement on the Wisconsin Professional Police Association's Facebook page. \"May we never forget his sacrifice and that of his loved ones who shared and supported his devotion to our common security.\" A total of 1,501 law enforcement officers died in the line of duty between 2004 and 2013 -- an average of one death every 58 hours, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.

Henry Solis, a Los Angeles Police Department rookie, is accused of killing 23-year-old Salome Rodriguez Jr. early in the morning of March 13 in Pomona. Solis disappeared shortly after the shooting. Items left by Solis at the crime scene allowed Pomona police detectives to identify him \"as the individual responsible for killing Rodriguez,\" according to an affidavit signed Thursday by FBI Special Agent Scott Garriola. The document goes on to say that Solis made \"incriminating statements about his role in the murder\" to friends, family members and others, and said he would never be seen again. The affidavit says his father, Victor Solis, quickly left his home in Lancaster after receiving a call from him. The elder Solis was seen a day later in El Paso, Texas, at the home of family members.

{"article":"John Carver says he cannot defend Papiss Cisse after admitting the Newcastle striker spitting in the face of Jonny Evans was worse than breaking the leg of an opponent. Newcastle will be without their 11-goal top scorer for the first time at Everton on Sunday since he was hit with a seven-game ban following the altercation with Evans. The Manchester United defender was suspended for six matches for his part in the incident, in which he first spat at Cisse to provoke the reaction from the Magpies striker. Newcastle's Papiss Cisse and Manchester United's Jonny Evans squared up to each other at St James' Park . Cisse has been banned for seven games, while Evans has received a six game suspension for the altercation . There has been a lot of debate in the 10 days since the disgusting clash as to whether or not spitting merited a ban double the length of one for a tackle which could cause serious injury. Carver, though, was clear on his thoughts when that question was put to him. \u2018When you have played the game it (spitting) is worse, yes,\u2019 he said. \u2018It's one of the lowest forms of anything you can do on the pitch. A lot of players would have acted differently. He retaliated in the same manner, which is just as bad. \u2018I sat with him and I said, \u201cListen, I can't defend you on this. You've done wrong and have to accept whatever punishment you get\u201d. There's no place in the game for it. He got what he deserved.\u2019 Evans' actions have been described as 'simply disgusting' by the FA's regulatory committee . Both Evans and Cisse were charged and banned by the FA for spitting, but Cisse admitted the offence . Cisse\u2019s future on Tyneside is now uncertain. Despite boasting the best goals-per-minute ratio in the Premier League this season, Newcastle remain concerned about a lingering knee issue for which he underwent more treatment this week. When asked if the 29-year-old would be at the club next year, Carver said: \u2018It's a difficult question to answer because I'm only thinking about the now, and I haven't got him for seven games. \u2018But he scores goals and I don't think his knee is a big issue. We have always used this word \u201cmaintenance\u201d about his knee and it is just making sure that everything is right. But he\u2019s a big loss.\u2019 Meanwhile, Carver admits he has sympathy with under-fire Everton boss Roberto Martinez. Newcastle finished fifth in 2012 but were nearly relegated the following season and cited the rigours of a Europa League campaign as reason for their struggle. \u2018Ask any of these managers who qualified for Europe how it affects your league form - you all start fighting for your lives down the bottom of that league table - it's not easy,\u2019 he said. \u2018They've got to do something about it. I would go back to a straight knockout format. \u2018When you work so hard to get your team into a position to qualify for it and then you've got to play so many games it's detrimental to your bread and butter, which is Premier League football. \u2018Spurs have a massive squad and were almost playing two different sides. That's how they coped with it \u2013 but Everton can't and we couldn\u2019t either.\u2019 Paul Carver admits he has sympathy with under-fire Everton manager Roberto Martinez ahead of he game .","highlights":"Newcastle will be without Papiss Cisse for seven games following a ban .\nThe striker admitted spitting in the face of defender Jonny Evans .\nEvans received a six match ban for his part in the obscene altercation .\nCisse boasts the best goals-per-minute ratio in the league this season ."}
{"article":"The Chinese are certainly doing things by the book when it comes to their bid for world football domination. The most populous nation on the planet is in the process of producing a series of textbooks for children aimed at teaching them how to play the beautiful game. Football-mad president Xi Jinping has already made the sport a compulsory part of the national curriculum for schoolchildren, with the aim of turning his country into a football powerhouse. Xi Jinping kicks a football during a 2012 visit to Croke Park in Dublin, Ireland, when he was China's vice president. The football-mad leader wants to make set his country on the road to being world champions . Thirty football 'experts' are involved in the drafting of the books, including 'football education specialists' Young players, teachers and coaches will be able to access online football tutorials linked to the books . 'We paid particular attention on gender ratio when we did the 3D pictures for the textbooks because we didn't want to let male players dominate the books', says the man in charge of their creation\u00a0Chen Keqi . Xi Jinping has been a football fan since he played for his school team and is said to be very keen to see his country climb the world rankings . And now China's young players will hopefully have everything they need to become future World Cup winners thanks to the new tools at their disposal. According to the Chinese People's Daily, the first series of football textbooks for students in primary and secondary school will be completed at the end of this month by the People's Education Press (PEP). Chen Keqi, director of the Sports Office at the PEP, says 30 football 'experts' are involved in the drafting of the books, including 'football education specialists' and primary and secondary school PE teachers. The texts feature tips on individual skills such as ball striking, dribbling and passing, but also place great stress on teamwork in order to 'cultivate students' will and character'. Mr Keqi said, 'Given the nature of this sport, the textbooks will highlight students' awareness of teamwork and cooperation. It is hoped the 3D young footballers will encourage China's budding players to become world beaters . Pupils will be taught basic skills including 'balancing on a ball' and doing 'keepy-uppy' with their insteps . 'It will aim to cultivate their hard-working and optimistic spirit. All that reflects the educational value of football. 'We aim to improve students\u2019 overall ability and make them well-developed both in mind and body. 'Students\u2019 awareness of duty and responsibility can be raised in this process of learning.' 'Any type of education must take building people\u2019s characters and passing knowledge on to students into account, and PE education is no exception.' There are seven volumes of textbooks, four of which will be for primary, middle school and first year high school students, while the remaining three are teaching guides for primary and secondary school coaches. Pupils from primary grades 3-4 will be taught basic skills including 'balancing on a ball' and doing 'keepy-uppy' with their insteps, while students from secondary grades 5-6 will be learning some more 'complex' skills such as keeping a ball in the air using different parts of their feet. The books feature 3D pictures to help teach positional play and develop 'attacking strategy'. China's men's team. For a country of 1.37billion people their ranking of 82 does not sit well with Chinese fans . China's men take on Uruguay at the Wuhan Sports Center Stadium in October 2010. President Xi wants the country to qualify for a World Cup again, like they did in 2002, and eventually win the competition . They also have green QR codes which readers can scan with their mobile phones to access online football tutorial videos. Mr Keqi said: '3D technology brought football skills to life and graphics can be easily understood by students. 'We paid particular attention on gender ratio when we did the 3D pictures for the textbooks because we didn't want to let male players dominate the books. 'In addition to publishing paper textbooks, we will introduce CD and online video tutorials to help teachers learn more about the sport. 'We will organise some training if possible to ensure teachers are best able to use the set of textbooks.' Prince William meets Mr Xi at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing earlier this month. The Aston Villa fan mentioned the Chinese president's love of football during their talk . Mr Xi is a massive fan of the beautiful game and he and many of his 1.37billion countryman are said to be ashamed at the lowly number 82 ranking of the Chinese men's national team. He dreams his country will again qualify for a World Cup \u2013 they last did so in 2002 but went out after failing to score \u2013 will have the opportunity to host the tournament and, most optimistically, will one day win it. At least China's women's team has a much better chance of doing that any time soon as they are currently ranked a much more respectable 13th in the world. On his recent visit to China Prince William bonded with Mr Xi over their mutual love of the round ball game. William, who is an Aston Villa fan, told the president: 'I also gather you're quite a football fan. I'm looking forward to learning about China's football'.","highlights":"Xi Jinping wants to make country of 1.37billion into a football powerhouse .\nFootball textbooks soon to be completed by the People's Education Press .\nAs well as individual skills, they will highlight 'teamwork and cooperation'\nBooks aim to cultivate students' 'will and character' and 'optimistic spirit'\nPrimary school pupils will learn 'balancing on a ball' and 'keepy-uppy'\n3D images will teach positional play and help develop 'attacking strategy'\nMr Xi wants to raise the lowly number 82 ranking of China's men's team ."}
{"article":"Jenson Button can understand the reasoning why Fernando Alonso will not be making his second debut with McLaren this weekend. On the advice of doctors, Alonso is absent from the season-opening Australian Grand Prix after sustaining concussion following a heavy crash on the final day of the second pre-season test last month. Fears were expressed to Alonso of 'second-impact syndrome' whereby a serious brain injury, or even death, could occur should the 33-year-old be involved in a second incident so soon after the first. Jenson Button walks through the paddock\u00a0at the Albert Park circuit ahead of the Australian Grand Prix . After several weeks testing (above), the Formula One season gets underway in Melbourne on Sunday . Despite that there has been scepticism of the decision, particularly as Alonso spent three days in a local hospital and passed a variety of tests. Button knows what it is like to suffer concussion as he was involved in a severe accident in practice for the 2003 Monaco Grand Prix, yet just a fortnight later was back behind the wheel of his car in Canada. On reflection, Button knows he should arguably have never driven in that subsequent race, so can understand the precautions taken with Alonso, even if they appear extreme. 'As far as I know he (Alonso) had three days (in hospital) undergoing every scan and check under the sun,' said Button. 'I'm sure whatever they've chosen to do is the correct decision. The British F1 driver understands why McLaren team-mate Fernando Alonso will miss the race . Alonso suffered concussion after a high speed crash at the Circuit de Catalunya on February 22 . 'Concussions vary. Some are very light, and then you have different grades of concussion, brain damage. 'For me, I raced two weeks after an accident in Monaco in 2003, with checks of standing on a box, closing one eye and whatever else I had to do. 'To be honest, I scraped through, so they let me race, but that was nearly 13 years ago. Now the checks are very stringent. 'With the incidents we've had, in particular with Jules (Bianchi in Japan last year), the medical people are going to be more strict, and so they should be.' A helicopter takes Alonso to hospital after the former world champion crashed during pre-season testing . The Spaniard waves to supporters after leaving hospital, having passed numerous tests . Despite Alonso's incident at Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya, Button insists he has no issues with the car. Initially, speculation centred on mechanical failure or an electrical issue given the new McLaren is now powered by Honda. The Woking-based marque, however, categorically ruled out any such faults and instead stated a freak gust of wind played its part in the double world champion veering off track and into a wall. Heading into Sunday's race at Melbourne's Albert Park, despite the lack of running throughout testing given numerous other glitches, Button maintains the car is one of the best he has driven. Button was involved in a serious accident at the 2003 Monaco Grand Prix before returning two weeks later . 'Competitiveness is impossible to say, but in terms of feel and how the car is and what you want it to do, it does everything right and a lot better than last year,' assessed Button. 'This car is very different in that it does what you hope it will do, which is very important for myself, and also for Fernando as far as I can see. 'The basic philosophy of the car and idea of the aerodynamics and how it works is definitely right. I haven't driven a McLaren like this before, not in the way it works. 'I'm not saying it's the quickest McLaren I have ever driven, because it's not, but in the way it works, the basic car is very good.' McLaren reserve driver\u00a0Kevin Magnussen will race in Alonso's absence at the Australian Grand Prix . Whilst Button is confident of finishing Sunday's race, he appreciates McLaren Honda are a long way off from challenging their main rivals. 'You are going to have doubts, and it would be stupid not to have doubts when you look at winter testing because we haven't completed a simulated race distance yet,' said Button. 'Yes, I do know it's going to be a tough start, but it's also very different. 'The last two years have not been the easiest seasons for us, but I think the difference with this year is the understanding there could be something very special on the horizon with McLaren Honda. Button looks on as the\u00a0NSX concept vehicle at a Honda F1 Grand Prix press conference . 'The whole team is unbelievably excited about what could happen in the future. 'But we also understand there's a lot of work needed before we even start thinking too much about winning races, even podiums and fighting for the world championship. 'It's a great base for the future, but it is going to take time. It's not going to be an overnight thing.'","highlights":"Fernando Alonso will miss F1 opener in Australia after suffering concussion during pre-season testing .\nMcLaren team-mate Jenson Button understands the reasons for safety .\nBritish driver was involved in serious accident at 2003 Monaco Grand Prix ."}
{"article":"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN)Islamic militants with the extremist group Al-Shabaab mounted a bloody attack Thursday on government administration offices in Baidoa, Somalia. Initial reports to police indicate that nine people, including four attackers, were killed after gunmen in military uniforms attacked the house of the former Somali parliament speaker and current president of the newly established southwest regional administration, said Col. Mahad Abdi, a Somali police officer. The attack began when a car bomb detonated at the gate of the state palace in Baidoa city, some 250 kilometers (155 miles) northwest of the capital, Mogadishu. Heavy gunfire broke out between Somali troops backed by Ethiopian forces inside the house of the regional president, Sharif Hassan Sheikh Aden. Explosions and gunfire were still going on over an hour after the initial assault, Abdi said. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack. A broadcast by the group's official radio station, Andulus, said that Al-Shabaab gunmen had entered the regional president's house and killed seven Ethiopian soldiers. The African Union's special representative for Somalia, Ambassador Maman S. Sidikou, condemned the attack, saying it had targeted troops who have worked to restore peace to Baidoa. \"I am deeply saddened by news of the attack in Baidoa this morning,\" he said in a statement released by AMISOM, the African Union mission to Somalia. Sidikou said he had also received reports of an attempted attack at a Mogadishu hotel Wednesday night. \"These are desperate attempts by Al-Shabaab to seek relevance, following the massive defeats they continue to suffer from the Somali National Army working together with AMISOM troops,\" he said. Al-Shabaab started with a goal of waging a war against the Somali government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia. It has since shifted focus to terrorist attacks in Somalia and beyond, even calling, in a video released last month, for attacks on shopping malls in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. U.S. authorities downplayed the threat. How big a threat is Al-Shabaab to the United States?

{"article":"Teenager Ash Handley scored on his home debut as Leeds moved to within two points of Super League leaders St Helens with a hard-fought 26-14 win over Wigan in front of a bumper 18,350 crowd at Headingley. Handley, drafted in for only his second senior appearance as a replacement for shoulder injury victim Tom Briscoe, was among five different try scorers as the Rhinos overcame the absence of skipper Kevin Sinfield to condemn Wigan to a third defeat in six matches. Liam Sutcliffe proved an able deputy for the injured Sinfield, scoring a try and kicking three goals, but Leeds' hero was Australian prop Adam Cuthbertson, who also scored a try and proved a real handful for the visitors with his powerful running and skilful ball handling. Teenager Ash Handley scored the second try for Leeds Rhinos on Friday night . Leeds, who handed a recall to full-back Zak Hardaker pending the outcome of a disciplinary investigation, were good value for their fifth win of the campaign but could never relax against their injury-hit opponents. The home side made the brighter start without finding the finishing touches and Wigan, captained by Leeds-born hooker Michael McIlorum, opened the scoring from their first real attack, with centre Anthony Gelling breaking clear to get the supporting Matty Smith over after 10 minutes. Smith kicked the conversion and added a penalty six minutes later after Cuthbertson was pulled up for a high tackle on George Williams to make it 8-0 . However, the Warriors made a hash of the restart and never touched the ball for the next eight minutes as Leeds struck a purple patch with three tries. Substitute Brad Singleton went over for the third try for Leeds Rhinos . Cuthbertson, who qualifies for England, got the first, following up a grubber kick on the last tackle by hooker Paul Aiton and was also involved in a sweeping move that was finished at the corner by Handley. The former Newcastle Knights forward then produced a superb short pass to get substitute Brad Singleton over and Sutcliffe kicked his second goal to make it 18-6. Wigan finally managed to stem the tide and struck back four minutes before the break when left winger Joe Burgess caught Williams' kick on the full to dive over for a spectacular try, which was goaled by Smith to cut the gap to just two points. Defences got on top in the second half, with Wigan having to do most of the work as the Rhinos gained the momentum. Referee Richard Silverwood gave the visitors a team warning after they conceded a string of penalties and the pressure told on the hour when Sutcliffe stretched out of a two-man tackle to score his side's third try. Sutcliffe was off target with the conversion attempt but succeeded with a penalty five minutes later after he was tackled by Wigan's Liam Farrell from an offside position. Farrell was sin-binned for the offence and the Rhinos made the most of their man advantage when substitute Rob Burrow forced his way over from dummy half with 11 minutes to go.","highlights":"Teenager Ash Handley scored on his home debut on Friday night .\nLeeds moved to within two points of Super League leaders St Helens ."}

We are so incredibly grateful for your support as well as the hard work and dedication of our amazing legal team and experts.  We thank you all. We especially want to thank our mom Jan for her belief in what we were doing all along, and for her never ending support. We will celebrate what would have been our dad's 76th birthday next month, and though we miss him every day -- just like the many thousands of well-wishers who have expressed their heartfelt goodwill - it is through his music that we find our compass and our paths moving forward.  We are his children, but we too are his fans and we hold his music dear. It is in that spirit and on behalf of all those who Dad always considered an extended family, his fans, we take this opportunity to set the record straight on a few misconceptions echoing through some news and social media platforms about our intentions, our plans, and the so-called 'larger' ramifications of this case within the music industry. Originally released in 1977, \"Got to Give It Up\" became one of our dad's most cherished hits, still a favorite at backyard barbecues, weddings, parties, on the radio, or on your iPod.  As Oprah said, it is one of her \"favorite party songs of all time.\" The comments on social media, emails and calls we received after the verdict affirmed for us that the song continues to touch in even deeper ways, becoming part of the soundtrack to so many lives.  \"Got to Give It Up\" is also recognized by Billboard Magazine as the fourth biggest single of the 30 charting hits our dad created during his extraordinary career. It has been nearly 38 years since its initial release: tastes change, trends evolve, but we should all be able to agree that it's a testament to the enduring power of \"Got to Give It Up\" that we have arrived at this juncture with Mr. Thicke and Mr. Williams, at all.  The fact that they have openly acknowledged their respect and admiration for the song is public knowledge, and further proof of its resonance with an entirely new generation of music fans. However, most songwriting begins with an organic approach; a songwriter brings his or her influences to the table and then works creatively from a blank slate in the crafting of their song to ensure originality and the integrity of their creation.  If Mr. Thicke and Mr. Williams had tried to create a new song and coincidentally infused \"Got to Give It Up\" into their work, instead of deliberately undertaking to \"write a song with the same groove,\" we would probably be having a different conversation. Like most artists, they could have licensed and secured the song for appropriate usage; a simple procedure usually arranged in advance of the song's release.  This did not happen. We would have welcomed a conversation with them before the release of their work. This also did not happen. Instead of licensing our father's song and giving him the appropriate songwriter credit, Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams released \"Blurred Lines\" and then filed a pre-emptive lawsuit against us, forcing us into court.  They sought to quickly affirm that their song was \"starkly different,\" than \"Got to Give It Up.\"  The Judge denied their motion for Summary Judgement, and a jury was charged with determining the \"extrinsic and intrinsic similarities\" of the songs.  The jury has spoken. We wanted to also make clear that the jury was not permitted to listen to the actual sound recording of \"Got to Give It Up.\"  Our dad's powerful vocal performance of his own song along with unique background sounds were eliminated from the trial, and the copyright infringement was based entirely on the similarity of the basic musical compositions, not on \"style,\" or \"feel,\" or \"era,\" or \"genre.\"  His song is so iconic that its basic composition stood strong. We feel this further amplifies the soundness of the verdict. Like all music fans, we have an added appreciation for songs that touch us in mysterious ways.  Mr. Thicke and Mr. Williams certainly have a right to be inspired by \"Got to Give It Up\" but as the jury ruled, they did not have the right to use it without permission as a blueprint for a track they were constructing. Great artists like our dad intentionally build their music to last, but we as the caretakers of such treasures, have an obligation to be vigilant about preserving the integrity of the music so that future generations understand its origins and feel its effect as the artist intended, and to assure that it retains its value. We feel as many do that, our father, Marvin Gaye, is an artist for the ages.  But whether we're talking about a work created 50 years ago or a work created 50 years from now -- protecting the legacy of original artistry is not a personal obligation, but a universal commitment in support of enduring creative achievement, encouraging future artists to also aim for new ground and their own legacies. That is what copyright laws help us do; they give people the incentive to write original songs and then help protect those songs. Our dad spent his life writing music- that is his legacy to us all- he wrote from his heart and was a brilliant songwriter, arranger, producer and one-of-a-kind vocalist.  If he were alive today, we feel he would embrace the technology available to artists and the diverse music choices and spaces accessible to fans who can stream a song at a moment's notice. But we also know he would be vigilant about safeguarding the artist's rights; a sacred devotion to not only the artist, but key in encouraging and supporting innovation. He also gave credit where credit is due. Howard King, the attorney for Mr. Thicke and Mr. Williams stated after the verdict:  \"We owe it to songwriters around the world to make sure this verdict doesn't stand.  My clients know they wrote the song 'Blurred Lines' from their heart and souls and no other source.\" We never for a minute suggested that Mr. Thicke and Mr. Williams' hearts weren't in it.  But a jury of eight men and women have ruled that the source for \"Blurred Lines\" was the song \"Got to Give It Up,\" a song our dad wrote from his heart, and delivered to the world with pure joy. With the digital age upon us, the threat of greater infringement looms for every artist.  It is our wish that our dad's legacy, and all great music, past, present, and future, be enjoyed and protected, with the knowledge that adhering to copyright standards assures our musical treasures will always be valued. And finally, we want to put to rest any rumors that we are contemplating claims against Pharrell Williams for his song, \"Happy.\"  This is 100% false.  We have absolutely no claim whatsoever concerning \"Happy.\" Love and Respect, . Nona, Frankie, and Marvin III .

{"article":"(CNN)In Washington's polarized political environment, support for Israel has been a rare area of bipartisan cooperation -- at least until now. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress on Tuesday threatens to undermine the nearly 67-year tradition of bipartisan support that has endured since President Harry Truman became the first head of state to recognize Israel. Netanyahu is driven not only by his concerns about Iran's nuclear threat -- the topic of his address -- but also by domestic political considerations. Israel will hold its national elections just two weeks after his visit to Washington. Netanyahu is fighting for his political life as he faces a tougher than expected re-election campaign. He has been widely blamed at home for having failed to lower the high cost of living, an issue that his rivals have eagerly exploited. Netanyahu has tried to offset some of this criticism by focusing on his perennial issue: Iran. A major televised address in Washington concerning Iran's threat, interrupted only by standing ovations from American lawmakers, has the potential to be far more effective than any campaign ad in projecting gravitas, reinforcing his security credentials and reminding voters of his vast experience -- in contrast to his rivals' inexperience -- in foreign affairs. Yet Netanyahu's speech, while possibly giving him a short-term boost at home, will harm Jerusalem's relations with Washington, not Iran's nuclear program. Speaker John Boehner's late-January invitation to Netanyahu to address a joint session of Congress was coordinated with neither the White House nor the State Department. It was, in essence, a political ploy aimed at undermining President Obama as he strives to reach a historic deal over Iran's nuclear program. In defiance of the Obama administration, and rejecting advice from leading figures in Israel and key supporters of Israel in the United States, Netanyahu accepted the invitation. By antagonizing the White House, Boehner and Netanyahu have put Democratic members of Congress in a bind, forcing them to choose between two unenviable options: either attend the speech out of respect for a close ally, but in so doing flout the president -- their party leader -- or demonstrate loyalty to Obama by snubbing the leader of a major U.S. ally. Two senior Senate Democrats with sterling pro-Israel credentials, Richard Durbin and Dianne Feinstein, tried to diffuse this latest crisis between Washington and Jerusalem by offering to meet with the Israeli premier behind closed doors but were rebuffed by Netanyahu. Feinstein had previously noted that an invitation to address Congress during the Israeli election period was \"highly inappropriate.\" In politicizing his visit to Washington, Netanyahu has allowed his bad blood with Obama to spill over into his government's increasingly complicated relationship with the Democratic Party. Netanyahu no doubt believes that Obama is misguided about the pending deal with Iran. Indeed, there are good reasons to be skeptical of any agreement with a regime that has long engaged in deception and concealment with respect to its nuclear program. Less than two weeks ago, the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that Iran was continuing to evade questions about evidence of past work on designing nuclear weapons. Yet Netanyahu's move is counterproductive. Democrats on Capitol Hill who were inclined to support additional sanctions on Iran now feel compelled to back the president. In a rare move, five former Israeli ambassadors have publicly called on Netanyahu to cancel his speech. Former Mossad chief Meir Dagan has accused Netanyahu of having caused Israel \"heavy strategic damage on the Iranian issue\" by antagonizing the administration. Netanyahu's foray into partisan politics is hardly a new phenomenon. He has never hid his preference for the Republican Party. During his first term in office, Netanyahu irked President Bill Clinton by meeting with the Rev. Jerry Falwell, then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other detractors of the President a day before coming to the White House. A key Netanyahu supporter is U.S. casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, a major Republican donor who also owns the pro-Netanyahu newspaper Israel Hayom. During the 2012 presidential campaign, Adelson poured millions into Republican challenger Mitt Romney's coffers, saying he was willing to spend $100 million to defeat Obama. That July, Netanyahu's senior adviser, Ron Dermer, helped orchestrate Romney's visit to Israel in what amounted to an implicit endorsement of Obama's rival. Dermer, a former U.S. citizen who once worked for Republican pollster and political consultant Frank Luntz, is Israel's current ambassador to the United States. It is Dermer who coordinated the invitation to Netanyahu with Boehner but never mentioned the invitation to Secretary of State John Kerry when they met a day before Boehner's announcement. This time, Netanyahu may have gone too far. National Security Adviser Susan Rice did not mince words when she called Netanyahu's latest move \"destructive to the fabric of the relationship\"  between the United States and Israel. Although the U.S.-Israel relationship is strong and resilient, rooted in common values and shared interests, Netanyahu is subjecting it to an unnecessary test with unknown consequences by choosing to play partisan politics.","highlights":"Ziv: By injecting himself into U.S. politics, the Israeli prime minister puts at risk a 67-year relationship between two countries .\nNetanyahu's speech to Congress poses a problem for Democrats too, Ziv says ."}

{"article":"(CNN)An ancient ring has shed new light on the ties between Vikings and the Islamic world, more than a century after its discovery. The finger ring found in a 9th century Swedish grave is inscribed with Arabic Kufic writing. The letters appear to read \"AL_LLH, researchers say, which they interpret as meaning \"for\/to (the approval of) Allah.\" In a paper published in the journal Scanning, the researchers say it is the only ring with an Arabic inscription ever found at a Scandinavian archaeological site. The object was originally discovered during a late 19th century grave excavation in the town of Birka, on Bj\u00f6rk\u00f6 island, about 19 miles (30 kilometers) from Stockholm. Birka was a key trading center during the Viking age and made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993. The ring is part of the Swedish History Museum's collection, originally cataloged as being made of gilded silver and violet amethyst, bearing the inscription \"Allah.\" Researchers led by Stockholm University biophysicist Sebastian W\u00e4rml\u00e4nder say they used \"scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to analyze the ring's composition and found that it was in fact made of silver alloy and the \"amethyst\" was colored glass. \"For the stone, we must remember that even though colored glass might today be perceived as a 'fake' material of lower value, this was not necessarily so in the past,\" the team cautioned. \"Even though glass production began around 5,000 years ago in the Levant it was still an exotic material in Viking Age Scandinavia.\" More significantly, the researchers found no trace of the gold that had been assumed to coat the ring and noted the presence of filing marks. \"Together with the absence of gold on the metal surface ... the file marks clearly show that the previous description of the ring as gilded was mistaken: if the surface had been gilt and the gold layer had worn away, also the file markings would be gone. But the metal surface displays no wear, and as the original file marks are still in place, this ring has never been much used.\" The team, therefore, believes the ring was passed from an Arabic silversmith to the woman, with few or any other owners in between. While imported coins were also found in the grave -- many from Afghanistan -- they were \"usually worn and torn ... from passing many hands along the established trade routes\" researchers said. The owner of the ring was found wearing traditional Scandinavian clothing, but the researchers said it was impossible to determine her ethnicity due to the decomposed state of the bones in the grave. \"It is not impossible that the woman herself, or someone close to her, might have visited -- or even originate from -- the Caliphate (which then stretched from Tunisia to the borders of India) or its surrounding regions,\" they said. While travel between the Islamic caliphate and the Viking world was recorded in ancient texts, tales of such journeys often included references to \"giants and dragons\" making it hard to tell fact from fiction, the researchers said. \"The importance of the studied Birka ring is that it most eloquently corroborates ancient tales about direct contacts between Viking Age Scandinavia and the Islamic world. Such contacts must have facilitated exchange of goods, culture, ideas, and news much more efficiently than indirect trade involving several merchants in-between,\" they concluded. Modern relationship . This new evidence of ancient ties between the Vikings and the caliphate comes at a time when Sweden's relationship with the modern Islamic world seems to be problematic. The country's foreign minister, Margot Wallstrom, has recently come under scrutiny after criticizing human rights in Saudi Arabia. In January, she tweeted that the flogging of blogger Raif Badawi was \"a cruel attempt to silence modern forms of expression,\" which needed to be stopped. Saudi Arabia blocked Wallstrom from giving a speech to the Arab League in Cairo on March 9, in which she planned to refer to human rights and the rights of women. Sweden subsequently announced that it would not renew its memorandum of understanding with Saudi Arabia on military cooperation -- and in turn Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates withdrew their ambassadors to Sweden. The United Arab Emirates said it had summoned Sweden's ambassador to protest \"the abusive remarks by the Foreign Minister of Sweden, Margot Wallstrom, against Saudi Arabia.\"","highlights":"Swedish researchers have used scanning to examine a ring found in a Viking grave .\nThe ring carries an Arabic inscription thought to be \"for\/to (the approval of) Allah, they say .\nTheir analysis suggests the ring was little worn, meaning trade ties could have been close ."}
{"article":"If history and a tilt at the career grand slam at the Masters seems a world away for Rory McIlroy amidst the water torture of Doral, then this is the week when it will all come into blessed focus. Forget the frustrated figure he cut on Friday when he created a YouTube highlight with his highland toss of his three iron into one of the many hazards that give the Blue Monster its name. This week it will all feel like stale news when he makes the ultimate golfing road trip. How does a couple of days behind closed doors at Augusta sound, with your dad for company, a couple of mates, a club member who knows all the course secrets and an athlete who is even more celebrated in America than the world No1? Rory McIlroy plays a shot on the sixth at the\u00a0the WGC-Cadillac Championship on Saturday . McIlroy plans to link up with four-time Super Bowl champion\u00a0Tom Brady at Augusta . All that awaits the 25-year-old as he combines a bit of rest and recreation with a touch of sharp prep work with the first major of the season now just a month away. \u2018To be honest, Augusta National is probably even nicer without the crowds than it is during the Masters, so it\u2019s going to be a great experience,\u2019 he said. The much-decorated athlete? None other than Tom Brady, quarterback with the New England Patriots and a four-time Super Bowl champion. He has played Augusta once before and shot a 77, so he is clearly no mean competitor. For a massive fan of virtually every sport like McIlroy, the appeal of linking up with Brady is obvious. As for the club member, Jeff Knox accompanied McIlroy when he was first man out in the third round of the Masters last year. Acting as marker, the 52 year old actually outscored him shooting 70 to McIlroy\u2019s 71, with the latter describing Knox\u2019s performance on the greens as \u2018the best I have ever seen at Augusta\u2019. World No 1 McIlroy threw a club into the water in frustration after more erratic play on Friday . It is not rocket science, therefore, as to why McIlroy would seek him out in a more friendly setting in an attempt to pick his brain. At the season\u2019s first major, McIlroy will be attempting to complete not only the career grand slam but a third major victory in a row, following his successes in The Open and the USPGA last year. As for Doral and the WGC-Cadillac Championship, McIlroy began his third round yesterday eight shots adrift of the leader JB Holmes. He actually made up three strokes on Holmes on Friday despite his three iron following his golf ball into the water at the par-five eighth. McIlroy played a lot better once he had let off steam, with the result that there were only nine players ahead of him at the halfway stage. Among them were some powerful hitters, including Dustin Johnson, Henrik Stenson and Bubba Watson. Welshman Jamie Donaldson was ninth. Australian Adam Scott turned in a remarkable opening two rounds to be just three off the lead. The Australian was not only playing his first tournament for three months, he was using a standard-length putter for the first time in four years.","highlights":"Rory McIlroy created a YouTube highlight by throwing club into water .\nWorld No 1 to spend a couple of days behind closed doors at Augusta ."}
{"article":"With five minutes gone Sergio Aguero embarked on one of his thrilling mazy runs deep into Leicester territory only to be flattened on the edge of the area. By David Silva. If Gary Neville was watching, he may well have given a knowing nod. The former Manchester United star spoke at length in the build up to this match about how City are unbalanced in a 4-4-2 when they play Aguero, Silva and Yaya Toure. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero cuts a frustrated figure during Wednesday's 2-0 victory over Leicester . David Silva jumps for joy and punches the air after giving Man City the lead at the Etihad Stadium . Silva proved his point - literally - sending the Argentine tumbling to the floor before many had even taken their seats. Neville's wider point was that the trio - breathtaking when on the front foot but seemingly out of breath when asked to defend - are a luxury Manuel Pellegrini can ill afford when up against the cream of Europe. With all due respect to Leicester they are not the cream of Europe, rather the dregs of the Premier League, but they proved his point more than once at a pancake-flat Etihad. From the kick-off Toure wandered into the visitors' half. It was where he would spend most of the match. The Ivorian's lack of an appetite for hard work did not go unnoticed among the blue-collar faithful. After one run, in which he was felled on the edge of the box but failed to win a free-kick, he stayed down for what seemed like an eternity. Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure appeared to go down for what seemed an eternity during the match . Aguero is surrounded by the Leicester defence as the Man City frontman bids to make an opening . By the time he got up, Leicester were on the attack in the City half. It was all too much for one punter in front of the press box who wasted no time in getting to his feet. 'Get up you lazy g**' was his frustrated shout. Nobody told him to shut up. Against cellar dweller opponents who have four wins from 26 attempts it was unimpressive stuff and perhaps an indication of why, before this encounter, City had just nine points from a possible 21 in the Premier League. It would be remiss, however, to deny that when it works (and it has won them two titles) it works well. For the opener, Toure's surging run ended with a pass to Silva in space. His flick found an overlapping Aleks Kolarov and after some ping pong in the Leicester box Silva prodded home. Silva prods the ball home past a sprawling Mark Schwarzer to give City the lead in first half injury time . Toure gestures in the direction of midfielder Jesus Navas during Wednesday's victory at the Etihad Stadium . Silva also lofted two delightful balls over the visitors' defence, one for a misfiring Wilfried Bony and one for Sergio Aguero. Both strikers put their efforts over the bar but it would be very difficult for any manager to drop the graceful Spaniard. Neville's point, however, was reaffirmed on 74 minutes. At 1-0, Nigel Pearson's plucky visitors should not have been in with a sniff. But in the midst of host of missed opportunities for the home side Riyad Mahrez hit a post. Had that gone in it could have been title race over. As it turned out, sub James Milner made it 2-0 after Silva had been replaced by Frank Lampard. Better opposition, however, would have reinforced Neville's point even further.","highlights":"Manchester City defeated Leicester 2-0 on Wednesday night .\nSergio Aguero and David Silva crashed into each other during early play .\nYaya Toure spent an eternity on the floor after failing to win a free-kick ."}
{"article":"The day before George Osborne delivers his budget to the nation the Lawn Tennis Association came up with its rough equivalent \u2013 the latest long term plan to revive the state of the game in Great Britain. Chief Executive Michael Downey finally unveiled his vision for the governing body, and in budgetary terms the big winner will be those people involved in marketing the sport and trying to get more people playing it. Over the next four years there will be a 50 per cent uplift in money spent on marketing, so that by 2018 around \u00a326 million will be spent on promoting the sport of tennis in the United Kingdom. While Andy Murrayis established as one of the world's best players, problems still exist at grass roots level . Other countries will look on enviously at such a huge sum although, given the current rankings of most GB juniors, many may well comfort themselves that their stocks of elite players will be superior for years to come. Downey reaffirmed the LTA's laudable, broad policy of building the game from the bottom up by concentrating on participation and talked through a range of worthy and sensible measures to help achieve this. However, there was nothing especially original to stir the imagination or make an impact with the wider public, no 'Parks tennis revolution' or some such thing. Anyone wanting to see something more radical to improve the British game would be left disappointed. Not that Downey, the former head of Tennis Canada who was appointed 18months ago, pulled all of his punches in presenting the latest of what have hitherto been doomed long-term plans for the British game. LTA Chief Executive Michael Downey has unveiled his long term strategy to rejuvenate the game . 'Our sport is declining and some people have a problem hearing that,' he said at the start. What he was specifically referring to was the problems tennis, like most other ball sports, has with declining participation numbers. They all face a challenge from what he termed 'doorstep' sports, highly convenient and less technically demanding activities such as running, cycling, swimming and going to the gym, which can be done solo and whenever time permits. Despite the hundreds of millions gleaned from Wimbledon profits and that event's ever growing popularity, there has been an average drop of 5 per cent in adult participation over each of the past five years. The particular problem is among the 16-44 age group with numbers steady above that. Curiously he omitted to mention, until asked, that tennis is now played to a greater or lesser extent in 20,000 schools among 2.6 million children, an impressive figure that would be envied by most other sports. Among the smorgasbord of measures to improve things, there will be a drive to increase participation in parks tennis. 'I think the old LTA would have driven by the parks and straight into the clubs and schools,' he said. The LTA receives millions annually from funds generated by the Wimbledon Championships . There were other sensible ideas. With tennis participation peaking in July, there will be a concerted effort to get people to start playing earlier in the year. Clubs, volunteers and coaches will get more support (attempts at this are nothing new). In junior tennis there will, wisely, be more emphasis on team events and there will be a much-needed concentration on creating a less pressured environment at junior tournaments. The emphasis will be on creating inclusive fun and recreational competitions across the board. Downey asserted that he was looking at the 'meat and potatoes' issues, rather than eyecatching initiatives. He also pledged that the LTA would spend money 'like it's your own' (no reference here to his own \u00a3434,000 pay package). It is, clearly, expecting too much for any results to be instant, as with the efforts to improve the elite end of tennis. He was unrepentant about cuts to the performance side of the game and funding for lower ranked players, pointing out that the average entry age into the world's top 100 is 21 for men and 20 for women. Murray's victory at SW19 in 2013 spiked interest but there has been a five per cent fall in adult participation . 'If you are 27 years old and still playing Futures I don't think you are going to be a top 50 player. It's a ruthless business,' he said, reiterating the 'no compromise' message he wants to run through the elite end of the sport. While there has to be a degree of patience with his plans, they also illustrated the glacial pace of how things tend to be done at the governing body compared to what would happen in the more dynamic private sector. There are many things that have not even been considered or barely thought about. Andy Murray, for instance, is nearly 28 and there is still no clue as to how to use his profile to spread the game. (Downey presented his ideas to him in Glasgow two weeks ago and was impressed by his interest.). Downey has spoken to Murray after Britain's 3-2 Davis Cup win over USA in Glasgow . TV advertising during the summer is not on the agenda. If there is an embracing of the excellent Tennis For Free charity and its proven methods then it seems limited. The whole key issue of playing surfaces did not raise a flicker, nor did the idea of adopting foreign training base with clay courts and a better climate. No participation targets have been set. The simple idea of trying to rebrand the organisation from its anachronistic 'Lawn Tennis Association' title to something more modern is apparently a non-starter for some reason. What was presented, though, was steady and sensible enough, while not especially imaginative nor wide in scope. Like most budget speeches, the effects of its contents will not be immediately obvious.","highlights":"LTA have unveiled their long term plan to get more people playing tennis .\nThere will be 50 per cent increase in marketing budget over next four years .\nThere has been five per cent drop in adult participation over last five years .\nChief Michael Downey has spoken to Andy Murray on spreading the game ."}
{"article":"Seoul, South Korea (CNN)North Korea has fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan, a South Korean Defense Ministry official said. The missiles were fired from North Korea's west coast into the sea, which is also known as the East Sea, around 6:30 a.m. and 6:40 a.m. Monday (4:30 p.m. and 4:40 p.m. ET Sunday), the official said. They were fired from an area near Nampo City, located about 60 kilometers (37 miles) southwest of Pyongyang. The two projectiles were estimated to have flown about 490 kilometers (304 miles) before falling into the sea east of the peninsula, according to the South Korean official, who asked to remain anonymous citing government policy. Considering the speed, altitude and distance the missiles traveled, they are assumed to be Scud-Cs, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry. The missiles were fired as the United States and South Korea began annual military drills, which United States Forces Korea describes as \"nonprovocative training\" that are \"an important component of readiness\" for defending South Korea. The annual joint military exercises, called Foal Eagle and Key Reserve, have long sparked tension between North Korea, South Korea and the United States. North Korea's state-run KCNA slammed the joint military exercises Monday, saying that the drills are \"nothing but a smokescreen\" by the United States and South Korea \"to cover up their surprise invasion of the north.\" \"The situation on the Korean peninsula is again inching close to the brink of a war,\" KCNA said, noting that North Korea's military \"will never remain a passive onlooker in this grave situation.\" North Korea was informed on February 24 when the joint drills would be held, said Kim Min-seok, the South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman. \"North Korea in the past did fire (projectiles) in a very similar manner,\" he said during a briefing Monday.  \"On several occasions, they fired (projectiles) from the west coast to sea off east of the Korean Peninsula.\" He added that North Korea fired about 90 ballistic missiles and rockets during last year's Foal Eagle and Key Resolve drill. \"Our military is strictly warning North Korean military of the reckless and the provocative act. We will firmly and strongly respond to any North Korea's provocation through solid united defense posture,\" South Korea's Kim said.

{"article":"(CNN)When an officer kills an unarmed suspect, the question arises time and again: Can a police department investigate a high-stakes case involving one of its own, without bias? For Wisconsin residents decrying the death of unarmed teen Tony Robinson, the question isn't even an issue. \"The investigation is being conducted by the state. We have a new law here in Wisconsin where departments are no longer conducting their own internal investigations for officer-involved shootings,\" Madison Mayor Paul Soglin said. In fact, Wisconsin is one of only two states with such legislation. The other is Connecticut. And that brings some comfort to Robinson's family. \"I trust Wisconsin and the way they're handling the investigation,\" Robinson's uncle Turin Carter told reporters. \"We spoke to investigators from DCI (Department of Criminal Investigation). We trust them, and we trust them to handle this with integrity and to treat it as it comes. We don't want our biases involved, we don't want anybody else's. We want them to act strictly as fact-finders, and that's what we believe in, and we have confidence in that.\" Wisconsin's law, which was enacted just last April, requires \"an investigation that is conducted by at least two investigators ... neither of whom is employed by a law enforcement agency that employs a law enforcement officer involved in the officer-involved death.\" After that, investigators must provide a report to the district attorney. If the district attorney determines there are no grounds to prosecute the officer involved, then the investigators must release their report to the public. Connecticut's law requires the state's Division of Criminal Justice with investigating any deadly force by law enforcement, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The state's chief attorney can appoint a special prosecutor, and the law also allows anyone to make a written request to the chief attorney to appoint a special prosecutor, the NCSL said. After that, Connecticut's Division of Criminal Justice must submit a report to the state's chief attorney detailing whether the use of deadly force was appropriate. While such laws are rather novel, a dozen other states have proposed measures about appointing special prosecutors for, or providing independent investigation in, officer-involved deaths, according to the NCSL. They include California, Connecticut, New York, Texas, Missouri, Minnesota, West Virginia, Kansas, Illinois, Tennessee, Mississippi, Oklahoma. \"Typically it doesn't work when you have to police yourself,\" said Mel Robbins, a CNN legal analyst who has began her career as a New York City public defender and now practices criminal law for Legal Aid Criminal Defense Society. \"This is why we have whistle blower protective statutes because people inside an organization will do everything they can to shut that person up. \"Having laws that require an outside agency to investigate would actually help police and prosecutors,\" she said. \"There's a suspicion that many have that police are corrupt. Many are not, but that is the perception. To begin to address that, these laws are needed.\" She noted the case of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old Cleveland boy who was playing with a pellet gun when an officer shot him dead in November 2014. After they were pressured from the child's family and the public, the police released  surveillance footage that showed that officers who arrived on the scene before the shooting did not administer first aid to the boy. Robbins thinks it's best to let a unit of prosecutors within the attorney general's office to review police-involved shootings rather than create an entirely new outside agency. CNN legal analyst and former New York City prosecutor Paul Callan said there are several reasons why outside entities, such as special prosecutors, aren't tasked with reviewing police shootings. \"Traditionally, elected district attorneys think they've done a fair and reasonable job with cases,\" he said. \"And frankly they perceive (appointment of a special prosecutor) as an insult and an attack on their integrity. It implies they are incapable of investigating police.\"There are \"powerful political forces lobbying against this kind of legislation,\" Callan said. It's also very costly to create parallel investigative structures just for police shootings, he said, and when budgets are already stretched thin, the idea of creating a new bureaucracy isn't appealing. Callan also noted the possibility that the appointment of a special prosecutor could work against minorities in certain situations. \"For the first time we are seeing minorities coming to political power in large U.S. cities and getting to the point where they can elect African-American or Hispanic district attorneys,\" he said. \"If a special prosecutor is appointed by a governor -- maybe a governor who is white who would appoint someone who is white -- does that really work to answer the call (for justice)? In the end you could have minorities deprived of power and not treated fairly by the system.\" Though Wisconsin's law has been in place for less than a year, it has already been applied in another officer-related killing. Milwaukee police officer Christopher Manney shot Dontre Hamilton, a mentally ill man, more than a dozen times last April.  The officer said he opened fire when Hamilton grabbed his baton and struck him with it. Manney was not charged in the death, but he was fired for not following protocol. Robinson's death stirred memories of two other unarmed men killed by police: Michael Brown, who was shot by officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner, who died at the hands of New York police officer Daniel Pantaleo. But there are stark differences between Robinson's case and the two others. After Brown's death in August, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson asked the neighboring St. Louis County Police Department to investigate. The case was not investigated by the state and was referred to a grand jury -- just like  in Garner's case. \"The decisions of grand juries not to indict the officers involved in the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown raised two primary concerns,\" the NCSL said. \"First, many were worried that since the evidence on which grand juries base their assessment is sealed, there is no opportunity for public scrutiny of their decisions. \"Second, there was apprehension over the decision not to appoint a special prosecutor in either case. Some are concerned that police may receive favorable treatment due to the close proximity in which law enforcement and district attorneys work.\" Robinson's case won't just by handled by state investigators; it'll go through another layer of scrutiny by the district attorney's office, Koval said. \"The State of Wisconsin's Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) has the exclusive authority to investigate all elements of the officer involved shooting -- forensics, interviews, technology feeds, etc.,\" Koval wrote on his official blog. \"This investigation is then turned directly over to the second layer of review, the District Attorney's Office, who then makes a ruling on the question of whether there is criminal culpability on the part of my officer.\" After the deaths of Brown and Garner, President Barack Obama announced the \"Task Force on 21st Century Policing,\" aimed at strengthening trust between communities and officers and identifying which practices can be improved. The task force's interim report, released this month, calls for independent investigations and independent special prosecutors in officer-related deaths. \"The importance of making sure that the sense of accountability when, in fact, law enforcement is involved in a deadly shooting is something that I think communities across the board are going to need to consider,\" Obama said. \"We have a great opportunity, coming out of some great conflict and tragedy, to really transform how we think about community law enforcement relations so that everybody feels safer and our law enforcement officers feel, rather than being embattled, feel fully supported.\" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Julie In and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","highlights":"Wisconsin state investigators -- not local police -- will investigate Tony Robinson's killing by officer .\nWisconsin and Connecticut are the only states that require independent probes in such cases .\n12 states have pending legislation requiring outside entities to examine police involved shootings ."}
{"article":"League One and Two clubs have been asked to consider proposals allowing Premier League Under-21 clubs to take part in the Football League Trophy. Clubs were very much against the addition of Premier League B teams to the Football League pyramid when it was suggested in June 2014, and this has now been put forward as an alternative. The proposal was one of many aired at a recent meeting at St George's Park to discuss issues arising from the FA Chairman's England Commission. The Johnstone's Paint Trophy could involve Premier League 'B' teams in future if plans get the go-ahead . Youth squads from the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea could soon be headed for the lower-tier cup . If the Football League do bring 'B' teams into the Johnstone's Paint Trophy, they could adopt a similar format to that suggested by Greg Dyke last year, meaning teams would: . It would see a change in format for the Trophy, with a group system being brought in. A statement from the Football League clarifying the situation read: 'Clubs have been asked to consider the concept of permitting 16 U21 teams from clubs with category one academies to participate in The Football League Trophy. 'The competition would feature 16 groups of four teams with one U21 team in each group, before a knockout stage leading to a final at Wembley Stadium. 'Given the previous concerns of the League and its clubs about Premier League B teams playing in the pyramid, any final proposal would also be accompanied by a change to the League's Articles of Association that would protect the current 72 club constitution, save for any changes to promotion\/relegation that clubs wished to make. 'Therefore, having provided them with this comfort, clubs willingly debated the potential commercial, financial and player development benefits of having U21 teams in this competition from 2015\/16. Peterborough manager Darren Ferguson holds the trophy last year - but a youth coach win it in future . Fans head to Wembley Stadium for the show-piece final of last year's competition in March . 'No formal proposals were tabled and no formal vote taken. 'Instead, League One and Two clubs were asked to indicate whether they were content to see The Football League progress the matter, which would include discussions with the Premier League and Football Association, so that clubs can consider a full proposal at a future point. 'Therefore, as yet, no club has voted in favour or against the idea of having U21 teams in The Football League Trophy, they have only indicated whether they wish to consider the matter further. 'Ultimately any changes to this competition will only happen with the support of League One and Two clubs.' What is the Football League Trophy? More commonly known as the Johnstone's Paint Trophy because of its sponsor, the Football League Trophy is a competition for the clubs of League One and League Two. The competition is divided into North and South sections and runs in a knockout format to a final staged at Wembley. This year's final will be played between Bristol City and Walsall on March 22. Peterborough United beat Chesterfield 3-1 in last season's final. What is a category one academy? Those clubs who have academies graded at the highest level under the Elite Player Performance Plan, an initiative introduced in 2011 by the Premier League to improve the quality and quantity of home-grown players in England. Category One academies have high contact time with young players, require a minimum of 18 full-time staff and an operational budget of \u00a32.5m or more. Which clubs fall into this category? Those that compete in the Barclays U21 Premier League are category one. There are 24 clubs. In Division One: Chelsea, Everton, Fulham, Leicester City, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Norwich City, Southampton, Sunderland, Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United. In Division Two: Arsenal, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Brighton and Hove Albion, Derby County, Middlesbrough, Newcastle United, Reading, Stoke City, West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers. How would this work? 16 of these under 21 sides would enter the JPT. The initial part would see 16 groups of four teams, with one under 21 team in each. It would then be followed by a knockout stage culminating in the Wembley final. Would it be fair? The current rules for the Under 21 Premier League allow teams to field three overage outfield players and one overage goalkeeper. That's why you will sometimes see a player returning from injury or struggling for form playing in an under 21 match. So the Football League clubs would predominantly be playing against teenage players but potentially with the odd big name thrown in. Of course, the rules could be altered. How would it fit into the calendar? While some Football League clubs take the Trophy seriously, it is viewed by many as a distraction from the league and other, more prestigious Cup competitions. Some clubs have fielded weakened sides in the competitions in the past. Crowds are also significantly lower than in other competitions, with a day out at Wembley the main attraction. For the under 21 teams, the games would have to be shoehorned in between Premier League games, the Under 21 Premier League Cup and the Under 21 International Cup.

{"article":"Barcelona kicked off the biggest week of their season in style by beating Eibar 2-0 thanks to a Lionel Messi double that took him past Cristiano Ronaldo as La Liga\u2019s top scorer this season. Barca play Manchestser City on Wednesday, just four days before the decisive Clasico against Real Madrid at the Camp Nou next Sunday, and Messi led them to victory with his 31st and 32nd goals of the season. He even scored a goal he had never scored before in La Liga \u2013 a header direct from a corner. Lionel Messi wheels away in celebration of his first half penalty, which put Barcelona into a 1-0 lead . The Barca star scored his 16th and 17th La Liga goals of 2015 as his side strolled to victory . At the start of the year Ronaldo collected the Balon d\u2019Or and sent an \u2018I\u2019m coming for you\u2019 message to Messi who has one more World Player award than the Portuguese. But instead it has been Messi pursuing, catching and over-taking Ronaldo in scoring stakes in Spain. The Real Madrid striker was 12 goals clear of Messi but the Bar\u00e7a number 10 has scored 17 goals in 10 games since the turn of the year and is now in top spot like his team. This was the first time Eibar had played Barcelona in Spain\u2019s top flight \u2013 it is with the Catalan club that the contrasts are most stark. They have 5,250 supporters crammed into the league\u2019s smallest ground while Bar\u00e7a\u2019s 99,000 capacity Camp Nou is La Liga\u2019s largest. Barcelona\u2019s budget runs to \u20ac540m euros, Eibar\u2019s is \u20ac16m; Bar\u00e7a make \u20ac140m from their television deal, Eibar make \u20ac14m; Bar\u00e7a\u2019s sponsor Qatar Airways pays them \u20ac35m a year while the minnows are paid \u20ac130,000 by a local steel company. On the pitch there are massive differences too. And the home team came into the game having scored 34 goals \u2013 six fewer than Messi. Although it was the Argentine who got the opening goal Bar\u00e7a had to suffer for the breakthrough. Neymar (left) and Ivan Rakitic (right) join Messi in celebration of his 31st minute spot-kick . They almost scored with their first attack when first Messi and then Ivan Rakitic went close after Luis Suarez and Adriano had combined down the left. But with a relatively inexperienced midfield trio of Sergi Roberto between, Rafinha and Rakitic, and faced with a five-man Eibar defence, the first half hour was heavy going. Luis Enrique had decided not to risk Javier Mascherano who was a booking away from missing next week\u2019s Clasico but his presence in a midfield already missing the injured Sergi Busquets was keenly felt at times as the leaders failed to control the game. Messi left five Eibar players behind with one dribble that started inside his own half but the move broke down as soon as he played in a team-mate and Eibar remained on level terms. Resistance was finally broken on the half hour when Suarez went on a driving run into the area and released Messi. Neymar skips past the challenge of Eibar's  Borja Ekiza during the La Liga clash . His shot cannoned off a defender and hit the arm of Eibar defender Borja Ekiza. The referee pointed to the spot and although keeper Jaime Jiminez dived the right way Messi\u2019s penalty beat him. The goal sent him one goal past Cristiano Ronaldo in the top scorer list in Spain. It\u2019s been an incredible turnaround since the Real Madrid striker raced to a 12 goal advantage over his nemesis earlier in the campaign. Neymar might have doubled Bar\u00e7a\u2019s lead but Messi\u2019s cross from the byline was cleared before it reached the Brazilian and Eibar made it to the break just the one goal down. Messi was at his very best at times and made a sensational 70-yard run during the first half . Messi set up Barcelona\u2019s first chance of the second period when he slipped Neymar through in the six-yard box only for team-mate to try and fail to nutmeg the goalkeeper. Having failed to create the second he scored it, and with the most unusual of Messi goals. Rakitic took a corner from the right and Messi found space 10 yards out. His header down skidded off the turf and past a defender on the line to make it 2-0. There was time for 35-year-old Xavi to come and make his 750th appearance for Barcelona as the visitors saw out the remaining minutes. Federico Piovaccari hit the bar but Barcelona took the points to mean they stay top a week ahead of the Clasico and four days ahead of the visit of Manchester City.","highlights":"Lionel Messi scored twice to help Barcelona earn 2-0 victory against Eibar .\nMessi gave Luis Enrique's side lead with first half penalty .\nArgentine star doubled Barca's lead with 55th minute header ."}
{"article":"London (CNN)Cabinet-maker Michael Ibsen has just put the finishing touches to a coffin; built of highly-polished, honey-colored English oak and yew, it has been a labor of love, pondered over and painstakingly crafted. Because this isn't any ordinary commission: the casket will be the final resting place of one of Ibsen's distant relatives, Richard III, who died more than 500 years ago. \"It is a unique privilege,\" says Canadian-born Ibsen, whose DNA was used to establish the identity of the English King, found buried beneath a car parking lot in the city of Leicester in August 2012. \"There's a wonderful serendipity in a sense that someone involved in the identification of the remains should happen to be furniture maker who can do this. \"When you're working away you just focus on joining two bits of wood, but at the end of the day when you stand back and think 'I'm building Richard III's coffin,' it's incredible.\" Ibsen says he's been on an \"extraordinary journey\" in the two-and-a-half years since he gave a DNA swab to genetics specialist Turi King on the off chance that experts searching for the burial place of his seventeen-times great-uncle might strike it lucky. Back then even the man in charge of the dig, archaeologist Richard Buckley, didn't expect to find anything -- he told colleagues he'd \"eat his hat\" if they turned up the long-lost King's remains. \"When we were planning the project, I never made any secret of the fact I thought it very unlikely we'd be successful,\" Buckley told CNN. \"The chances of hitting the right spot were very slim.\" Call it a fluke, or call it fate, but as it turned out they hit the right spot almost immediately: Richard III's skeleton was found on the very first day of the dig, in the first trench dug by the team. At the time, all the experts knew was that they'd found a set of leg bones, chopped off at the feet by building work at some point in the intervening centuries. It wasn't until days later, as archaeologist Jo Appleby carefully exhumed the rest of the skeleton that she spotted the distinct curve of its spine, and the devastating damage medieval weapons had left on its skull. For Philippa Langley, founder of the \"Looking for Richard\" project, who stood watching with bated breath as the bones were uncovered, the discovery was a vindication of the years she had spent trying to get people to search for the King's remains -- and to look again at his reputation. Say the name Richard III to many people, and the image which will spring to mind is that of Shakespeare's villain, hunchbacked and murderous, who met a grisly end on the battlefield at Bosworth after killing his nephews, the Princes in the Tower. Years of research had convinced Langley of two things: firstly, that his remains lay underneath a car park, in what had once been the Grey Friars' monastery, and secondly, that he was much-maligned, the victim of bitter Tudor propaganda after his death. Two-and-a-half years on, Langley believes the discovery -- which proved her first theory to be correct -- and the scientific research carried out since, have forced a rethink of Richard III's story. \"As a writer my view of Richard has always been that he was a very complex, very conflicted, very flawed individual -- that's the human condition: We are all flawed, complex, conflicted -- but there was something heroic about him, he was courageous on and off the battlefield,\" she explains. She says DNA evidence that the King was blue eyed and fair haired -- in contrast to portraits and written descriptions which painted him \"as a hunchback, with a withered arm and a crippled gait, with 'evil' dark eyes and hair\" -- had \"blow[n] the mythology out of the window.\" \"It makes people question, drop their preconceptions, forget their assumptions, and go back to the beginning,\" she says. This weekend, Richard III's skeleton will leave the laboratory at the University of Leicester, where it has been kept since it was found, and be taken back to Bosworth, scene of his death in 1485, for a commemoration ceremony, before being returned to Leicester ahead of its reburial next week. And while his body last made that trip slung unceremoniously over the back of a horse, this time the journey will be done in style: carried in the coffin made by his great-nephew. Inside, the smaller bones from his hands and feet will be tucked into linen bags -- each one decorated with a rose, representing the House of York, Richard III's family -- sewn by children from Leicester's King Richard III Infant School. \"I feel very proud because I've never made a bag for a king before,\" said Xi Chen, who helped make the pouches. \"It's like I'm a servant doing something for a King,\" added his classmate Irfan Sheikh. Lead conservation specialist Jon Castleman -- who previously helped to restore the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem -- will be the last person to set eyes on the skeleton, as he welds the ossuary inside the casket shut. Well-wishers are expected to line the route as the cortege winds through the Leicestershire countryside, stopping at several churches along the way for prayers and religious services before making its way back to Leicester Cathedral, near the site of the archaeological dig, where a new tomb has been built for the King. Historian John Ashdown-Hill, who discovered the genealogical link between Richard III and Michael Ibsen, says it is important that the King's Catholic beliefs are recognized in the ceremonies. Ashdown-Hill, who shares Richard III's faith, has had a rosary, featuring the white Yorkist rose and a crucifix like one thought to have been owned by Richard III's mother, made to be placed inside the coffin. For Langley, the procession and celebrations are key to repairing past damage. \"The ethos and aim of the project was to give Richard what he didn't get in 1485,\" she says. \"The reason we wanted to do that was to recognize what went on in the past but not repeat it, to make peace with history.\"","highlights":"Richard III's remains were found beneath a car park in Leicester in 2012 .\nLong-lost King's skeleton is to be reinterred in the city's cathedral later this week .\nBones will be buried in a coffin made by Richard III's descendant, Michael Ibsen ."}

{"article":"(CNN)The U.S. Ambassador to South Korea, Mark Lippert, was attacked in Seoul, and is in stable condition, receiving treatment at a local hospital, according to the U.S. embassy. According to Seoul police, Lippert was slashed on his right cheek and hand with a knife measuring about 10 inches long at 5:42 p.m. ET on Wednesday. A South Korean news agency reported that the suspect was opposed to the joint South Korea-U.S. military drills that launched earlier this week, but Seoul police said the motive for the attack and how it was organized are under investigation. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf confirmed the ambassador had been attacked while giving a speech in Seoul Thursday morning, and said that the South Korean embassy is coordinating with local law enforcement on the attack. \"We strongly condemn this act of violence. The ambassador is being treated at a local hospital. His injuries are not life threatening,\" she said. South Korean president, Park Geun-hye condemned the attack: \"This incident is not only a physical attack on the U.S. ambassador, but an attack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance and it can never be tolerated.\" She pledged a \"thorough investigation and strengthening\" of protection. Lippert is a longtime friend and confidant of President Barack Obama, who has been a member of his inner circle since the President's time as senator. According to National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan, Obama called Lippert to wish him well. \"The President called U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Korea, Mark Lippert, to tell him that he and his wife Robyn are in his thoughts and prayers, and to wish him the very best for a speedy recovery,\" Meehan said in a statement. According to local police chief Yoon Myung-seon, the event was organized by the Korea Council For Reconciliation and Cooperation, and the suspect in the attack was a member of the council. According to South Korean news agency Yonhap, the suspect is a 55-year-old man with the last name \"Kim,\" who authorities say was opposed to the joint South Korea-U.S. military drills that kicked off earlier this week. Yonhap reported that the suspect came up from behind, pushed Lippert down on a table and started attacking him. In July 2010, Kim received a suspended two-year prison sentence for throwing a piece of concrete at a Japanese Ambassador to South Korea, Yonhap said. South Korea's YTN news channel reported that Lippert was about to deliver a speech at a breakfast being held at Sejong Hall in Seoul. The report says nothing specific about the attack, only that yelling was heard and then the bloodied ambassador was taken to the hospital. The suspect was reportedly detained and is currently under investigation. Lippert has been close to Obama ever since he arrived in the Senate in 2005. Lippert worked with Obama on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and traveled the world with the senator as he garnered the foreign policy experience that helped pave the way for his presidential campaign. When Obama declared he would run for president in the 2008 race, Lippert was by his side again, and was on the road with the candidate and ultimately served as the chief foreign policy adviser for the Obama campaign. In 2007, Lippert was deployed as a Naval Reserve Lieutenant to Iraq to work as an intelligence officer with Navy SEALS. A Wall Street Journal profile of the diplomat published that year detailed an anecdote in which Lippert received an email on his Blackberry from then-Sen. Obama which read, \"I miss you, brother.\" Lippert's deployment was not without irony, because he was in Iraq at a time when his boss was actively campaigning against what he said was a \"dumb war.\" After his deployment, Lippert returned to Washington and served as deputy national security adviser and chief of staff for the National Security Council in the Obama White House. In October 2009, however, he decided to return to active duty. He was deployed to Afghanistan and he also served as an intelligence officer for the Naval Special Warfare Development Group in Virginia Beach. \"He is a close friend, and I admire and respect his devotion to our country and answering the call to active duty service,\" Obama said in a statement at the time. Lippert was nominated to be the top Asia policy official in the Pentagon in 2011, amid stories that he had clashed with former national security adviser, retired Gen. James Jones, while he served on the NSC. Bob Woodward reported in his book, \"Obama's Wars,\" that Jones resented Lippert and another former Senate aide Denis McDonough, who later was to become White House chief of staff, referring to them as part of the \"politburo\" who he thought thwarted the effective framing of policy. Woodward reported in the book that Obama affectionately referred to the two close aides by the Dr. Seuss nickname of \"Thing One and Thing Two.\" Obama nominated Lippert to serve as ambassador to South Korea last year. CNN's Barbara Starr, Jim Acosta and Paula Hancocks contributed to this report.","highlights":"U.S. ambassador to South Korea attacked, but in stable condition ."}
{"article":"(CNN)The fianc\u00e9e of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez said at a hearing Friday that she was asked to conceal a box and take it out of her Massachusetts home after the murder of Odin Lloyd in 2013. Shayanna Jenkins' testimony came outside the presence of the jury during a hearing on the limits of her testimony. But it signaled where the prosecution intends to take its questioning of the key witness, who took the stand before the jury later Friday. She is testifying after being granted immunity. Hernandez, the ex-tight end who had a $40 million contract until he was charged with murder, has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the death of Lloyd, a semi-pro football player. He has also pleaded not guilty to other weapons charges. His co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, have also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. \"You took that box out and concealed it. Were you attempting to do it in a way so that people didn't know what you were doing?\" Bristol County District Attorney William McCauley asked. \"That's correct,\" Jenkins said. The weapon in the case has not been recovered. The prosecution has said Hernandez's high school sweetheart removed the weapon from their North Attleboro home after Lloyd was killed on June 17, 2013. The state also alleges that she lied to a grand jury several times about the presence of guns in the home. She faces possible jail time if found guilty of perjury charges. Jenkins has pleaded not guilty. Jenkins testified she was \"instructed\" to take the box out of the home, and that it was \"important\" for her to get rid of it. On the day after Lloyd's killing, prosecutors have said Jenkins received a coded text message from Hernandez. Search warrants said Hernandez asked his fianc\u00e9e to remove something from their basement. The text message said: \"Go ... in back of the screen in movie room when u (sic) get home an (sic) there is a box ... jus (sic) in case u were looking for it!!! Member (sic) how you ruined the big tv ... WAS JUST THINKIN bout that lol wink wink love u TTYL....K\" Asked about the text message Friday afternoon, in the presence of the jury, Jenkins said she didn't know what it meant. Jenkins also told the jury that she met her fiance's two alleged accomplices in the killing of Lloyd and gave them $500 in cash as police were questioning Hernandez about the slaying. Jenkins testified that she took Hernandez to a police station on June 18, 2013, and that he asked her to give Wallace money. Wallace was comforting to her, Jenkins told the jury. \"He said everything would be OK,\" she said. She went to a bank ATM and withdrew $500 to give Wallace. \"I don't remember the dollar amount he asked for but I remember telling him that was the amount I could take out,\" she testified. Hours after Lloyd's death, Jenkins said, Hernandez appeared \"normal\" and his two alleged accomplices appeared \"fine.\" Jenkins, 25, and Hernandez are the parents of a daughter who was just a year old when her father was arrested on June 26, 2013. Her sister Shaneah was dating Lloyd, 27, who was shot six times, according to prosecutors. At one point, McCauley asked Jenkins if she ever saw guns in the home. She told the jury that she saw one \"in the kitchen junk drawer.\" Prosecution witnesses have testified that Lloyd was shot to death with a .45-caliber Glock handgun. McCauley approached Jenkins on the stand with a Glock similar to the one used in the murder. \"Is that a secured firearm?\" she asked, moving back slightly. \"Yes.\" McCauley asked if the Glock's shape was similar to the one she saw in the junk drawer. \"Yes,\" she responded. \"Color?\" \"Yes.\" Size? \"I'm not sure,\" she told the jury. Jenkins' testimony resumes next week.

{"article":"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)Joint Iraqi forces have started what they believe will be the conclusive push to retake the Iraqi city of Tikrit from ISIS, a paramilitary force participating in the offensive said Tuesday. The forces have started \"the decisive operation\" to liberate Tikrit just over a week after the overall operation began, advancing toward the city from several directions, according to a statement from the predominantly Shiite paramilitary force Hashd Al-Shaab. ISIS wasn't making it easy, however. The Sunni extremist group blew up a key bridge near Tikrit, preventing the joint Iraqi forces from using it to cross the Tigris River to approach the city from the east. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered Iraqi forces on March 1 to retake Tikrit and Salahuddin province. Tikrit, best known to Westerners as the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, fell in June to ISIS, which has captured parts of Iraq and Syria for what it says is its Islamic caliphate. In the past few days, forces progressed roughly 50 miles (80 kilometers) down one road toward the city and, by Monday, were about a mile from its center. ISIS fighters have retreated toward the city center from frontline positions, Hashd Al-Shaab's media office said Tuesday. Al-Shaab's forces appear to be leading the fight for Tikrit, with support from the Iraqi army and Sunni tribesmen. Also assisting is Iran, which has provided advisers, weapons and ammunition to the Iraqi government. According to the Pentagon, there may be Iranians operating heavy artillery and rocket launchers as well. There have been several failed attempts to recapture Tikrit since the second half of 2014. If Iraq regains control of the city, it could mean that retaking Mosul -- a city 10 times bigger -- is possible. The Tikrit offensive involves around 30,000 fighters. CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report from Atlanta.","highlights":"A major offensive for the city was launched just over a week ago .\nISIS forces are retreating toward the center of Tikrit, says a Shiite force participating in the offensive ."}
{"article":"Dusseldorf, Germany (CNN)Years before he was at the controls of a Germanwings plane that plunged into the French Alps, Andreas Lubitz told the airline he worked for that he'd had a bout with depression. Lubitz, the co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525 who authorities accuse of deliberately crashing the plane, told his Lufthansa flight training school in 2009 that he had a \"previous episode of severe depression,\" the airline said Tuesday. Email correspondence between Lubitz and the school discovered in an internal investigation, Lufthansa said, included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training. The announcement indicates that Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, knew of Lubitz's battle with depression, allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit. Lufthansa, whose CEO previously said Lubitz was 100% fit to fly, described its statement Tuesday as a \"swift and seamless clarification\" and said it was sharing the information and documents -- including training and medical records -- with public prosecutors. What was mental state of Germanwings co-pilot? It's a development that will likely be a part of the crash investigation, but it's only one piece of the puzzle, CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest said. \"We need to know what happened after he returned in 2009 and finished his training, because that tells us whether there was the correct procedure and process,\" he said. A Lufthansa spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday that Lubitz had a valid medical certificate, had passed all his examinations and \"held all the licenses required.\" Check out the latest from our correspondents . The details about Lubitz's correspondence with the flight school during his training were among several developments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and Lubitz's possible motive for downing the jet. Earlier, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Dusseldorf said Lubitz suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career. Medical records reveal that Lubitz was suicidal at one time and underwent psychotherapy before he got his pilot's license, prosecutor's spokesman Christoph Kumpa said. Kumpa emphasized there's no evidence suggesting Lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash. Investigators are looking into whether Lubitz feared his medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot's license, a European government official briefed on the investigation into last week's crash told CNN on Tuesday. While flying was \"a big part of his life,\" the source said, it's only one theory being considered. Another source, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation, also told CNN that authorities believe the primary motive for Lubitz to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not be allowed to fly because of his medical problems. Lubitz's girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist, both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had psychological issues, the European government official said. Lubitz told the neuropsychologist that he was too stressed with work, the official said. But no matter what details emerge about his previous mental health struggles, there's more to the story, said Brian Russell, a forensic psychologist. \"Psychology can explain why somebody would turn rage inward on themselves about the fact that maybe they weren't going to keep doing their job and they're upset about that and so they're suicidal,\" he said. \"But there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it outward on 149 other people who had nothing to do with the person's problems.\" Reports say a cell phone video shows the nightmarish final seconds of Germanwings Flight 9525, but a police spokesman said the accounts were \"completely wrong.\" French magazine Paris Match and German newspaper Bild reported that a video recovered from a phone at the wreckage site showed the inside of the plane moments before it crashed. \"One can hear cries of 'My God' in several languages,\" Paris Match reported. \"Metallic banging can also be heard more than three times, perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object.  Towards the end, after a heavy shake, stronger than the others, the screaming intensifies. Then nothing.\" The two publications described the video, but did not post it on their websites. The publications reported that they watched the video, which was found by a source close to the investigation. \"It is a very disturbing scene,\" said Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of Bild online. An official with France's accident investigation agency, the BEA, said the agency is not aware of any such video. Lt. Col. Jean-Marc Menichini, a French Gendarmerie spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the Germanwings crash site, told CNN that the reports were \"completely wrong\" and \"unwarranted.\" Cell phones have been collected at the site, he said, but that they \"hadn't been exploited yet.\" Menichini said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the Criminal Research Institute in Rosny sous-Bois, near Paris, in order to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand-in-hand with investigators. But none of the cell phones found so far have been sent to the institute, Menichini said. Asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media, Menichini answered with a categorical \"no.\" Reichelt told \"Erin Burnett: Outfront\" that he had watched the video and stood by the report, saying Bild and Paris Match are \"very confident\" that the clip is real. He noted that investigators only revealed they'd recovered cell phones from the crash site after Bild and Paris Match published their reports. \"That is something we did not know before. ... Overall we can say many things of the investigation weren't revealed by the investigation at the beginning,\" he said. While investigators search for clues to Lubitz's motivation, recovery workers continue the grim task of searching for the remains of those killed in the March 24 crash. The remains of at least 78 people on board the plane have been identified so far using DNA analysis. Naffrechoux warned Monday that \"it may not be possible to find the human remains of all the 150 passengers, as some of them may have been pulverized by the crash.\" But French President Francois Hollande, speaking alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin, was more positive, saying that it should be possible to identify all the victims by the end of the week. A simple stone memorial has been set up at Le Vernet, where grieving relatives of those killed have laid flowers and held prayers. Germanwings crash compensation: What we know . Who was the captain of Germanwings Flight 9525? The BEA, France's accident investigation agency, said its ongoing safety investigation was focusing on a more detailed analysis of the flight history leading up to the crash, based on the audio recovered from the cockpit voice recorder and any other available data. \"A deliberate act by a man with a disturbed psychological profile is a possible scenario,\" BEA spokeswoman Martine Del Bono told CNN. \"The first step of the investigation is to describe more precisely what happened.\" This will be based mainly on analysis of the cockpit voice recorder, to be supplemented by data from the flight data recorder if it is found, she said. \"But we will also look at other events with possibly similar scenarios, try to understand if there are systemic weaknesses which may contribute or facilitate such scenarios. \"We will in particular look at the cockpit door locking as well as the criteria and procedures applied to detect specific psychological profiles.\" CNN's Pamela Brown reported from Dusseldorf and Frederik Pleitgen from Cologne, while Catherine E. Shoichet wrote from Atlanta.

{"article":"(CNN)There is only one likely outcome for Baghdad's current military offensive to reclaim Tikrit: defeat for ISIS. The campaign to restore central government authority over the restive Salahudin province is seen as both symbolic and strategic for Baghdad which has invested too much already for it to afford losing this battle. ISIS are said to have booby-trapped much of the city in an attempt to slow down the government assault. However, the task at hand has been made easier for Baghdad given that most civilians in Tikrit have already fled -- both to Kurdistan in the north as well as south to Baghdad -- leaving behind mostly ISIS jihadists who defend the city, according to Iraqi constitutional specialist Zaid al-Ali, who is from the city. Initial reports of the multi-pronged attack on Tikrit have been encouraging. Iraqi forces have already cleared a number of areas on the outskirts and are expected to continue advancing towards the city center as both heavy artillery and helicopter gunships pound ISIS militants who have taken up defensive positions. Another crucial element for the success of this battle will be the varied make-up of the groups involved in the fight. The joint Iraqi forces fighting to retake Tikrit include Iraqi troops, members of the mainly Shia Hashd al-Shabi paramilitary force, members of the Sunni Sons of Salahuddin brigades, and other Sunni tribal fighters. The offensive involves around 30,000 fighters in all. Although the campaign is Iraqi-led, help from outside is also going to play an important role. Though the United States has not conducted any airstrikes in this campaign yet, this may well change as the battle develops. Iran, in stark contrast to the U.S., provided Iraq with immediate and much-needed military assistance when the security crisis escalated last June. The Iranians are heavily invested in this current campaign and are also not going to let the Iraqis lose. Unlike in Syria, the Americans and Iranians both share a common enemy and a common friend in Iraq, but due to wider political considerations neither Washington nor Tehran will admit that there is any form of tacit cooperation in Iraq. However, the campaign for Tikrit is just another front where such cooperation is likely to be already happening behind the scenes. Baghdad will make use of U.S. intelligence that will almost certainly be shared with the Iranian officers who are advising the Iraqi army. General Qasim Suleimani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Quds Force, who has played a key role in the fight against ISIS, was reported to be near Tikrit just hours after the military campaign was officially launched. Iran provides military advice, support and weapons not just through the central government in Baghdad but also directly to a number of increasingly powerful Shia militia groups that now operate under the state-sponsored paramilitary committee, the Hashd Al-Shabi, known as the \"Popular Mobilization Units.\" The two key Iraqi leaders of this paramilitary command, Hadi al-Ameri and Abu Mehdi al-Mohandis, were also pictured together with General Fadhil Barwari, the commander of Iraq's elite Special Operation Forces. Though there are few civilians left in Tikrit, all eyes will be on the Iraqi security forces -- and especially the Shia militias --- to see if abuses are carried out once the enemy is routed. Prime Minister Abadi already warned the anti-ISIS fighters to protect civilians and properties in the area and also gave the \"misled\" ISIS militants a last chance to lay down their arms before the troops made their advance. The battle is an especially emotional one for the Shia soldiers and fighters as Tikrit is the site of the Camp Speicher massacre last June, where 1,700 Shia soldiers were captured, separated from their Sunni comrades and then summarily executed in an atrocity that was documented by ISIS as a powerful propaganda film. However, it is encouraging that both Shia and Sunni fighters are supporting the army in its effort to defeat ISIS. The cooperation between Shia and Sunni fighters will be crucial not just in the ongoing offensive in Tikrit but will also set the stage for further cooperation in the strategic campaign to recapture Mosul. Politically, these groups may not see eye-to-eye and of course there remain deep ethno-sectarian tensions in Iraq and beyond, but regardless of these differences they all view ISIS as a common threat and enemy that must be defeated. To be sure, the Sunni tribesmen involved in this campaign are more anti-ISIS than they are pro-government, but that they can work with the pro-government Shia militias is both good news and good progress for a country believed to be ripping itself apart along ethno-sectarian lines.","highlights":"Likely outcome for Baghdad's current offensive to reclaim Tikrit is defeat for ISIS, writes Hayder al-Khoei .\nAl-Khoei: Crucial element for success will be varied make-up of the groups involved in the fight .\nBoth Shia and Sunni groups view ISIS as a common threat and enemy that must be defeated, he adds ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Every time a snowstorm bears down on Danbury, Connecticut -- which has happened a lot this winter -- students and parents turn to Twitter to find out whether schools will be closed. They rarely get a straight answer. Instead, Danbury residents see jokes, meme-filled videos and teasing references to snow days at fictional high schools from \"Glee\" or \"Grease\" -- all courtesy of Mayor Mark Boughton, a social-media prankster whose @MayorMark account provides actual updates about school closings amid all the buffoonery. \"Attention: West Beverly Hills High School is closed for tomorrow. #90210,\" read one recent mayoral tweet. Boughton always gets around to the real news eventually. But first come the wisecracks. He was in especially rare form Tuesday night, tweeting almost a dozen snow-day jokes, Storify user and freelance journalist Kristin Hussey chronicled, as yet another storm hit Danbury. Parents and students tuning in for real news about snow days might find this running gag irritating. But on Twitter, at least, many students seem to get the joke. \"@MayorMark you better get each and every one of us a therapist after all of stress you're causing us,\" wrote one. \"The kids take it tongue in cheek. They understand, because it's sort of a tradition around here,\" said Boughton, who told CNN he's been trading jokes about snow days with students on Twitter for several years now. \"We go back and forth. But it's all in good fun.\" One twist of the whole thing is that Boughton doesn't even make the call about closing Danbury schools. That decision is left to Superintendent of Schools Sal Pascarella, who confers with Boughton by phone and then sends an automated update to every parent's phone. But Boughton, who ran for governor of Connecticut last year and has 18,000 Twitter followers, usually posts his school-closing tweets first. Finally, after hours of build-up, the mayor gave people of Danbury the news at 6:21 a.m. Wednesday: Schools would open two hours late. The mayor says he wants to help young people engage with public servants -- and show them that he can be funny. \"I have a very serious policy side ... but I like to have a good chuckle,\" he said. \"That's who I am. In the end, I think it (social media) is about being yourself.\" He says he rarely gets complaints about his Twitter feed, and that \"parents think it's hysterical.\" But maybe not all Danbury parents. \"As a parent, has it been helpful? No,\" said Stephanie Pabon, whose 6-year-old son attends a Danbury magnet school. \"Because as a parent I don't have time for Twitter.\"","highlights":"Mayor of Danbury, Connecticut, teases students on Twitter about school closings .\nMark Boughton tweets jokes, keeps kids guessing about snow days .\nMayor: \"It is sort of a tradition around here\""}
{"article":"(CNN)Formula One star Fernando Alonso returned to work at McLaren on Wednesday following his freak accident in winter testing. The Spanish double world champion was ruled out of the opening race in Australia by doctors treating him for the effects of a high speed crash. Alonso has been training hard for his planned comeback at the Malaysian Grand Prix in nine days' time and used the McLaren simulator to hone his mental preparations. The CNN-sponsored team announced the news on Twitter, showing McLaren sporting director Eric Boullier and Alonso at the team's headquarters in Woking, England. Alonso was concussed and airlifted to hospital after losing control of his McLaren at the penultimate winter test at Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya on February 22. The 33-year-old watched the Melbourne race from his home in Dubai after doctors indicated returning to racing three weeks after a high impact was too risky. McLaren had explained that Alonso's \"accident was caused by the unpredictably gusty winds at that part of the circuit at that time.\" After getting back to race preparation in the simulator, McLaren tweeted that it had been a good day for Alonso, \"focusing on operational work and practicing qualifying and race procedures.\" The media enjoyed a guessing game in Australia about just how Alonso might have reacted to events in Melbourne, where Lewis Hamilton and his mighty Mercedes dominated while Alonso's McLaren teammate Jenson Button finished in last place. Dane Kevin Magnussen, who was deputizing for the recuperating Spaniard, was unable to start the race because of engine problems on his way to the starting grid. Alonso left Ferrari at the end of the 2014 season to rejoin McLaren, which is experiencing teething as it renews technical partnership with Japanese engine manufacturer Honda for 2015. In his response on Twitter, Alonso chose to focus on congratulating Spanish rookie Carlos Sainz, who finished ninth on his Toro Rosso debut and who was inspired by Alonso as he plotted his own racing career. \"Congratulations to @carlosainz for the great weekend in Australia!! And of course to Hamilton and Mercedes for the win!! See you in Malaysia,\" Alonso's message read. Meanwhile, Boullier is focused on finding improvements in the car's pace and performance for the next race on Sepang's sizzling circuit, which is also very physically demanding on the drivers. \"We know we have a mountain to climb as far as performance is concerned,\" the Frenchman said in a McLaren statement. \"In two weeks' time we'll be racing in Sepang [Malaysia], where the weather is bound to be extremely hot and humid. \"I'm not going to be rash enough to predict a form upswing in so short a time frame, but we'll be working flat out between now and then to make performance and reliability gains in any and every way we can, of that you may be 100 per cent certain.\"","highlights":"Fernando Alonso steps up comeback preparations in McLaren simulator .\nThe double world champion is targeting a return at the Malaysian Grand Prix .\nThe sizzling race in Sepang is on March 29 ."}
{"article":"Peter Moores insists he has no regrets about returning to become England coach for the second time even though they face a humiliating early exit from the World Cup if they lose here on Monday against Bangladesh. Moores, a county championship winner with both Sussex and Lancashire, finds himself under increasing pressure to prove he has what it takes to succeed at international level after England's woeful showing at this World Cup. They need to defeat both Bangladesh at the Adelaide Oval and Afghanistan in Sydney on Friday while hoping New Zealand also beat Bangladesh to ensure they claim the quarter-final place that should have been comfortable for them. England coach Peter Moores talks to the media during a press conference at the Adelaide Oval on Sunday . Moores insists he has no regrets about returning to become England coach for the second time . Moores finds himself under increasing pressure to prove he has what it takes to succeed at international level . But Moores, who often struggles to get his message across in public, cut a calm and quietly confident figure here as he contemplated a match that he cannot afford to lose for the sake of his reputation in the job. 'No regrets at all,' insisted Moores. 'I came in because I felt I could help make a difference. You have to be one of a lot of people working together and we know we've certainly been behind in the one-day format and have to get better. 'I've no regrets on taking on that challenge. As a coach you have only one focus now and that's the World Cup. It comes once every four years and we have one goal at the moment \u2013 to win tomorrow and stay in this tournament. 'I'm fine because we've got a very committed group of players and coaches and that's the most important thing. We're doing everything we possibly can to improve quickly and start to get the results we need.' Moores first spell as coach ended when he fell out with then captain Kevin Pietersen and both lost their jobs but he believes that it is too early in his second coming to judge him. 'Time will tell,' said Moores, who was described as the outstanding coach of his generation by managing director Paul Downton when he appointed him in the wake of England's Ashes debacle here last year. 'I'd love to say things change straight-away but they don't. England coach Moores speaks with Moeen Ali during an England nets session in Adelaide . England have endured some rotten World Cups since they went close in 1992 and must beat Bangladesh . England know they can not afford a slip-up or even a rainy day as they prepare to face Bangladesh . 'What we've seen so far is the emergence of some players who've had a really good time and others who have found challenges. The emergence of Mo Ali has been really exciting and Joe Root is starting to grow as a player. 'Individually we've seen people grow but there's work to be done with our younger one-day international players so that they can play the right kind of cricket. That's a long-term thing. 'Test match-wise it was great to finish with three wins against India last summer and identify a new-look line-up. There are some exciting things but there are some challenges too and we're in one at the moment with this World Cup. Mostly in coaching you get judged over time and on what you leave behind as well as what you do there and then.' England will not confirm their team to face a Bangladesh team they lost to in the last World Cup until the toss on Monday but Moores defended Gary Ballance and stayed in the nets with the out of form batsman to provide extra practice today when England's session was finished. 'Gary's had a tough time of it but that doesn't mean he's not a really good player,' said Moores. 'We know we've got a big game and we've thought about what our best team is. We're pretty clear on what that best XI is now. We'll announce it at the toss.' Ian Bell of England takes a catch during an England nets session at the Adelaide Oval . England's Alex Hales takes a catch during an England nets session on Saturday ahead of their next game . If Ballance stays despite a run of four failures since replacing Ravi Bopara on the eve of the World Cup then it would be confirmation for Alex Hales that they are really not sure whether he can reproduce his Twenty20 form over 50-overs. If Hales does not play now then clearly England do not rate him. England still seem reluctant to play a second spinner in James Tredwell but Chris Jordan appeared to be in the frame today, possibly at the expense of the maddeningly inconsistent Steven Finn. Or Ballance if England decide to play an extra bowler. 'It looks a good batting pitch and I expect it to be full of runs,' said Moores. 'There's pressure on us because we haven't played as well as we'd like to have done and we have to win the game. International cricket is about handling that pressure. It's part of the job and that's the challenge for the players tomorrow. We're up for that.' There was also discouragement for his old b\u00eate noire Pietersen, who appeared to be handed an England lifeline by new ECB chairman Colin Graves last week when he said he would be considered again if he played regular county cricket. 'It sounds like what Colin said was taken out of context and the policy on the KP situation has been made very clear by Paul Downton,' added Moores.

{"article":"Lausanne, Switzerland (CNN)Nuclear talks intensified Sunday between world powers and Iran, but key sticking points remained unresolved as the countries tried to reach a deal to curb Tehran's nuclear program ahead of a Tuesday deadline. As the negotiations entered their fourth day, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned the agreement coming together is worse than Israel's deepest fears. The talks had hit a snag on Saturday, with diplomats describing Iran as refusing to budge, but as the French, German and Chinese foreign ministers arrived, the mood seemed more optimistic. The British and Russian foreign ministers were expected late Sunday. U.S. officials and Western diplomats described the negotiations as tough and intense, which was expected as the talks reached the endgame. They said the contours of a deal are becoming clearer, but they were unsure it could be reached. Two core issues are still unresolved: 1) Limits on Iranian research and development on advanced nuclear technology in the end years of the deal; and 2) The pace of lifting United Nations sanctions. The U.S. officials stressed all of the elements were interrelated and nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to, comparing the final deal to a puzzle. But they indicated most of the other elements were solvable if those two major hurdles could be overcome. The speed of which U.N. sanctions could be lifted remains in dispute. Iran wants them lifted immediately after the deal goes into effect. While diplomats say Iran could see unilateral sanctions relief in the areas of trade, oil and banking, sanctions adopted by the United Nations are more complicated. Many are related to proliferation and transfer of missile technology and are tied to certification by the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, that Iran's nuclear program does not have a military dimension. On Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Zarif made clear the issue of sanctions remains a stumbling block, saying he believes the world powers \"have realized that sanctions, pressure and an agreement will not go together. It's only to translate that understanding and realization into the agreement that we are negotiating.\" U.S. officials said that all sides, including Iran, agree that sanctions would be lifted in phases over time as Iran confirms its compliance to the deal. But they acknowledge there is still disagreement on the actual formula. Iran also wants the ability to continue to research and develop more advanced centrifuges while the deal is in effect. Those machines can enrich uranium much faster than its current machines. U.S. and European officials worry that could enable Iran to quickly produce enough uranium for a nuclear weapon. Diplomats say the first 10 years of the 15 year deal would have the most stringent restrictions, with others being relaxed over the next five. \"We will see if they are ready to swallow what we proposed,\" a Western diplomat said. \"We are not asking them to do nothing, but they want to do more than we want them to do\" referring to how much research the Iranians want to be able to still undertake. But the diplomat added, \"after 15 years, they can do what they want.\" A senior Iranian diplomat told CNN on Sunday: \"It's not fair to characterize the state of affairs as Iranian resistance on those issues. It can also be characterized as the other side's intransigence in the talks.\" Diplomats said Iran has agreed to a cap of fewer than 6,000 centrifuges that it can operate to enrich uranium, a process that can lead to weapons-grade material.  The figure is down from the 6,000 the sides were speaking about when the talks started on Thursday, but substantially more than the several hundred the United States had originally wanted.  Iran currently runs about 10,000 centrifuges, but it has around 19,000 in its stockpile. U.S. officials maintain the number is abstract, because there will be other restrictions on the levels of enrichment and type of centrifuges Iran can operate, which they believe will extend the time Iran would need to have enough fissile material produce a nuclear weapon -- known as the \"break-out time\"  -- to at least a year. On Monday, a senior State Department official said negotiators had not yet decided anything about the disposal of fissile material. There had been word previously that Iran might export it to Russia, but an Iranian negotiator, Abbas Araqchi, told journalists Sunday that Iran had not agreed to it. \"The export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our program, and we do not intend to them abroad. ... There is no question of sending the stocks abroad,\" he said. Netanyahu voiced alarm at the emerging deal. After meeting with visiting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, Netanyahu said, \"this agreement as it evolves is fulfilling our deepest fears and even worse.\" \"In parallel to the gathering for this dangerous agreement, the proxies of Iran in the Middle East are carrying out a wide occupation of Yemen,\" he said. \"The Iran-Lausanne-Yemen axis is very dangerous to mankind and needs to be stopped.\" The parties are seeking agreement on the basic parameters of a deal before March 31. A comprehensive deal including technical annexes is supposed to be concluded by June 30. Tuesday is seen as a critical milestone to the U.S. negotiators, who are trying to thwart a threat from Congress to impose additional sanctions without the  framework. That could prompt Iran to withdraw from the talks and scuttle the chances of a deal altogether. But even if a pact is reached, it is unclear what form it would take. U.S. officials say they will need to publicize something that quantifies Iran's commitments before submitting it to Congress. But U.S. and Western diplomats say that Iran is looking simply for an \"understanding\" of what has been agreed to before a formal accord is reached. CNN's Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.","highlights":"One key sticking point: What would be the limits on Iranian nuclear research?\nAnother sticking point: When would U.N. sanctions be lifted?\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warns the deal would be a disaster ."}

Parisse revealed on Twitter that the soft-tissue injury is \u2018less severe than expected\u2019 and he could still feature alongside prop Martin Castrogiovanni, who is understood to have been recalled to the squad after suffering a serious dog bite on his nose three weeks ago. Today he tweeted an image of his foot in an ice bath in a bid to get fit for the clash. Sergio Parisse limped off during Italy's defeat by France in Rome at the weekend . If Parisse plays he will be a major factor in Wales' attempts to win the Six Nations . VIDEO Italy v France - extended highlights . The veteran Azzurri pair have 221 Tests between them and their experience could be a major obstacle to Welsh ambitions of securing the necessary landslide victory at the Stadio Olimpico. Wales kept themselves in contention for the title with a classic defensive display against Ireland on Saturday but, with the race likely to be decided by points difference, focus must now shift towards attack. If the trophy is going to head back to Cardiff, then Gatland\u2019s side must burst open the floodgates of the River Tiber and better the scoring record of both England and Ireland. Having topped the tackle count at the Millennium Stadium with \u2014 according to the Welsh camp \u2014 a record-breaking 38 hits, Luke Charteris is hoping to keep his place in the second row. His side are up first in a triple-bill of fixtures and, with kick-offs staggered throughout the day, the 32-year-old has already decided how to kill the time as other results unfold. Wales beat Ireland 23-16 at the Millennium Stadium to force themselves into title contention . Warren Gatland knows his team need a large victory to overhaul England and Ireland . \u2018We\u2019ll have to find some good Italian wine,\u2019 joked Charteris. \u2018First, you have to try to win the game. If you look any further than winning the game by a point then you become unstuck. \u2018That has happened in the past and as soon as you do that, you are disrespecting the opposition. If we can win, it gives us a chance. \u2018We saw just how good a team they are when they won in Scotland. I know a few of the boys so it will be a really tough game.\u2019 In an ideal scenario, Gatland would have had the option to keep the same starting XV that beat Ireland. But the Kiwi will be without tight-head prop Samson Lee, who was sent to London yesterday to seek specialist advice on a potentially World Cup-threatening Achilles injury. The front-row problems have been compounded by doubts over Richard Hibbard and Gethin Jenkins \u2014 prompting call-ups for Exeter\u2019s Tomas Francis and Saracens\u2019 Rhys Gill, but not Adam Jones. Gatland's Wales side have a +12 points difference, 25 behind England and 21 adrift of Ireland . Jonathan Davies and Dan Biggar share a joke during a Wales training session . The 34-year-old British Lion has hinted that he could be drawn out of retirement, however Welsh forwards coach Robin McBryde insists the onus is on the player to reverse his decision. \u2018We would be open to a call from him,\u2019 said McBryde. \u2018It was his decision to hang up his boots on the international front. I still have his number, but there\u2019s no need to call him at the moment. As far as I\u2019m concerned, he\u2019s announced his retirement and, until he changes his mind, at the moment we have enough strength in depth.\u2019 McBryde moved to allay concerns over Jamie Roberts after the 28-year-old was brought off with a head injury against Ireland. The Racing Metro centre has been a mainstay throughout the competition but, in Scott Williams, Wales have attack-minded cover that could exploit Italian weaknesses in the final quarter. \u2018We have seen so far that up until the 60-minute mark Italy have been in the game and competing,\u2019 said McBryde. \u2018They will be hugely disappointed with their performance against France and I am sure they will be looking to finish on a high, so that makes them more dangerous. We are dealing with a wounded animal. \u2018Saturday was a hugely physical Test and some of the players\u2019 reactions following that match reflected the intensity. \u2018The fact they have come out of that match on top makes the bruises feel that little less painful. The spirit is good and, by still being in the hunt for the title, everyone has come in with an appetite and an edge to build on the momentum.\u2019","highlights":"Sergio Parisse could be fit for Italy's clash with Wales in Rome .\nWales need a big win to overhaul England and Ireland .\nParisse limped off against France, but has been cleared of serious damage ."}

{"article":"Germany has been gripped by claims and counter-claims that footage allegedly showing the new Greek finance minister giving the country a one-fingered salute was faked. A video appeared online earlier this week which appeared to show Yanis Varoufakis holding up his middle finger when giving a speech about Greece's finances and Germany in 2013. Jan Bohermann, host of satirical TV programme 'Neo Magazin Royale' on public broadcast channel ZDF, then admitted that his production team had doctored the footage. But now it has been claimed that his confession itself was faked - sparking confusion as to whether the video really is genuine. Scroll down for video . Faked: Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis was accused of making an offensive gesture with his middle finger during a speech he gave in 2013 about the country's finances, and mentioning Germany . Funny:\u00a0Mr Varoufakis laughed off the incident on Twitter and said: 'We politicians need you badly' Mr Bohermann said he had been waiting to be asked if he had faked the controversial video, but that no-one had queried their work. He added:\u00a0'Sorry Mr Varoufakis, we won't do it again.' But ZDF has now issued a knowing reminder to its audience that 'Neo Magazin Royale' is a satirical programme and ironically tweeted that it would place a 'careful, satire' warning on all future broadcasts. That has sparked a new wave of speculation over whether the video is in fact the real deal and the hashtag #varoufake has been Germany's top trending topic on Twitter throughout today. The footage appears to show Mr Varoufakis raises his finger and saying: 'My proposal was that Greece should simply announce that it is defaulting, just like Argentina did, within the euro, in January 2010, and stick the finger to Germany and say well, you can now solve this problem by yourself.' Mr Varoufakis has repeatedly denied the footage was authentic and \u00a0laughed off the incident on Twitter. He sent a message to Mr\u00a0Bohermann that read: 'Humour, satire & self deprecation are great solvents of blind nationalism. We politicians need you badly.' Mr Varoufakis is continuing to negotiate for a reduction in Greece's debt from the EU and has been doing a whistlestop tour of Europe in a bid to get support for his proposals. Pressure: Yanis Varoufakis has been under increasing pressure to secure a better loan repayment deal for Greece . He has been trying to negotiate favourable terms for the country to pay back its debt to the EU since the election of the radical left-wing party Syriza in January. Alexis Tsipras, leader of the radical left-wing party heading the new coalition, immediately demanded a renegotiation of Greece' \u00a3179 billion international bailout deal. The party has continued to describe itself as 'anti-austerity.' Mr Varoufakis last month visited Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in London to garner support for the move and has been touring several European countries. Greece was likely to run out of money by March if a deal was not reached before the end of February, and a four month extension to the bailout programme for Greece was agreed on a conditional basis. February 9 2010 \u2013 Greek Parliament approved first austerity package measures - \u00a0included a freeze in the salaries of all government employees, a 10% cut in bonuses, and cuts in overtime workers. March 3 2010 \u2013 Parliament passed a new major austerity package. Measures included: Pensions freezes, an increase in sales tax from 19% to 21%, rises in taxes on fuel, cigarettes and alcohol, rises in taxes on luxury goods, cuts in public sector pay. April 23 2010 \u2013 George Papandreou, Greece's prime minister formally requested an international bailout. The financing will come from an emergency aid package with the participation of European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund. May 2 2010 \u2013 Papandreou, the IMF, and euro-zone leaders agree to a \u20ac110 billion bailout package that would take effect over the next three years. The government announced the new austerity package measures. June 29 2011 \u2013 Parliament passed the new austerity package. October 20 2011 \u2013 Government passed the multi-austerity bill, amid protests and violent riots outside the parliament building. February 12 2012 \u2013 Parliament passed new austerity package measures amid violent protests. Many buildings in the centre of Athens burnt during riots. November 5 2012 \u2013 Parliament adopted new round of austerity cuts required for Greece to receive the next installment of the international economic bailout. April 28 013 \u2013 Parliament approved bill that included cutting 15,000 state jobs . July 17 2013 \u2013 Parliament approves new austerity measures . March 30 2014 \u2013 Parliament passed new multi-bill needed for Greece to receive its next bailout. April 10 2014 \u2013 Greece returned to financial markets, with the issue of 3 billion Eurobonds. December 8 2014 \u2013 Greek government announced snap presidential vote. Next day the Greek stock market fell 12.78%, a fall record since 1989. December 29 2014 \u2013Government collapses after failing to elect new president of Greece. January 2015 - Alexis Tsipras of Syriza becomes prime minister and launches attempt to persuade European Union and IMF to ease terms of bail-outs. But there are still concerns the country could run out of money, as Greek officials complain the repayment measures are starving them of money. Earlier this week, Greece had handed over 580m euros to the International Monetary Fund, clearing its debt for this month. But it will face another 350m euros bill tomorrow - generating further tensions between Greece and the eurozone and fears that the country could drop out of the single currency altogether. The allegations come as Varoufakis, an outspoken Marxist economist and blogger, has faced a number of criticisms. He came under fire after taking part in a photo shoot for Paris Match - him and his wife posing with glasses of wine on their roof terrace.","highlights":"Video appeared to show\u00a0Yanis Varoufakis making offensive gesture .\nTV prankster has now admitted doctoring the footage for laughs .\nSatirical show host Jan Bohermann said: 'Sorry, we won't do it again'\nBut now it has been claimed his confession was a joke in itself .\nFinance minister has been trying to negotiate a better debt deal for Greece .\nMr\u00a0Varoufakis has been under pressure from EU to secure repayments ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Nineteen-year-old Tony Robinson was not armed when a Madison, Wisconsin, police officer fatally shot him, Police Chief Mike Koval said Saturday. \"We have to be clear about this,\" Koval said. \"He was unarmed. That's going to make this all the more complicated for the investigators, the public, to accept, to understand ... why deadly force had to be used.\" The officer who killed Robinson, 12-year department veteran Matt Kenny, had used deadly force before, shooting and killing a man in 2007, the chief said. Kenny was exonerated of any wrongdoing and even received a commendation, the chief said, adding that the incident was \"concluded to be a suicide by cop\" situation. Robinson was shot after allegedly assaulting Kenny, who was responding Friday evening to a reported disturbance at a Madison residence, Koval said. Afterward, protesters in this university town took to the streets and converged on City Hall, chanting \"Black lives matter.\" Koval called for calm, while acknowledging the protests are reminiscent of those that followed the deaths of black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and Staten Island, New York, after confrontations with police. Police described Robinson as African-American. \"In light of so much things that have happened not just across the country, but in our own community, it's understandable that the reaction at the scene and of some of our citizens is extremely volatile, emotional and upsetting,\" the police chief told CNN affiliate WKOW-TV. \"And we understand that. That's absolutely appropriate under these circumstances. We would urge, obviously, that everyone exercise restraint.\" Koval said he visited the home of Robinson's mother late Friday night and met Robinson's grandparents outside the house. They talked and prayed, the chief said, but they advised him to put off visiting Robinson's mother \"based on the dynamics\" of the situation. \"I couldn't even begin to get my hands around the enormity of the loss and the tragic consequences,\" he said. \"Nineteen years old is too young.\" Robinson's mother, Andrea Irwin, told CNN affiliate WKOW that she didn't understand what happened. \"My son has never been a violent person, never,\" she said. \"To die in such a violent way baffles me.\" Irwin said Robinson served as a father figure to her other children. \"He was our caretaker and so gentle,\" she said. The incident started when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars, Koval said. Dispatchers identified him as Robinson, according to 911 audio obtained by WKOW. A little later the dispatcher says, \"Apparently Tony hit one of his friends, um no weapons seen.\" About four minutes later, the dispatcher says, \"I got another call for the same suspect at [the same address]. He tried to strangle another patron.\" About 30 seconds later, an unidentified officer says, \"Shots fired, shots fired.\" When Kenny went to the apartment, he heard some commotion and forced his way in, Koval said. \"Once inside the home the subject involved in this incident -- the same one allegedly out in traffic and that had battered someone -- assaulted my officer,\" Koval said. After that, according to the chief, \"The officer did draw his revolver and subsequently shot the subject.\" Backup officers and others at the scene performed CPR on the young man, who later died at the hospital. Kenny suffered a blow to the head, but is being treated and will be released, Koval said. Kenny has been placed on administrative leave with pay. Koval said he's not sure what Robinson was doing at the house in the first place. \"His relationship to the home is unclear to me, although there were certainly familiar acquaintances. This was not a random place. He had hung out.\" In a statement Saturday, state Attorney General Brad Schimel said he \"can only imagine the heartbreak\" of Robinson's parents and added he's \"concerned for the officer ... who, I imagine, is experiencing great trauma as well.\" \"They are all in my thoughts and prayers,\" Schimel said. Under Wisconsin law, officer-involved shootings are investigated by an outside agency, in this case the Division of Criminal Investigation. Once DCI completes the investigation, the report will go to the local district attorney, Koval said. Some are demanding answers sooner rather than later. On Friday night, dozens of demonstrators came out to the area around the apartment, which police had blocked off. A group also moved toward City Hall before dispersing early Saturday. \"Who do we trust?\" some called out, prompting the response, \"No one!\" And in another refrain, they chanted, \"Black lives matter.\" The protesters' sentiments were echoed online, where some adopted the #WillyStreet hashtag in reference to Williamson Street, where the shooting happened. \"Praying for Madison tonight,\" wrote one activist. \"Stand up, sit in, walk out - until u get answers. And until there are no more hashtag eulogies.\" Mayor Paul Soglin spoke to the raw feelings, calling what happened \"an enormous tragedy.\" \"We've got a family that's really hurting,\" Soglin said, according to WKOW. \"And we've got a city and neighborhood that's feeling pretty well hurt itself.\" Some of the protesters were members of the Young, Gifted and Black Coalition that was formed last summer after the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson. The group wants more reactive policing in African-American neighborhoods, said group member Brandi Grayson. She said Madison police park on street corners in African-American neighborhoods and wait for something to happen, which leads to residents being hassled. That doesn't happen in white neighborhoods, she said. She said Young, Gifted and Black will be working with church groups on Sunday and will hold more rallies Tuesday and Wednesday. CNN's Faith Karami and Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report.","highlights":"Tony Robinson, 19, was unarmed when an officer killed him, police chief says .\nOfficer has been involved in a fatal shooting on duty in 2007, chief says .\nActivists hit the streets and take to Twitter to vent anger over the shooting ."}
{"article":"(CNN)A previously unknown species of catfish has been named for the wide-eyed, puckered-mouth \"Star Wars\" character it resembles. Its scientific name is Peckoltia greedoi, and it is known for its large, dark eyes, puckered lips and protruding bristles. But you can call him Greedo, in honor of the bounty hunter from \"Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.\" You might remember him from the cantina scene on Mos Eisley, where he was killed by Han Solo while attempting to collect on a debt for Jabba the Hutt. \"I think it was the whole package that evoked Greedo, but particularly the eyes and the underslung mouth,\" said Jonathan Armbruster, biological sciences professor and curator of fishes at the Auburn University Museum of Natural History. Armbruster made the connection in September with colleagues David Werneke, Milton Tan and Chris Hamilton. But, like many things in academia, it took a while to make it official. The specimens were found in 1998 by researchers along the Gurupi River in Brazil. Armbruster obtained them in 2005 from a museum in Porto Alegre for a manuscript he was preparing on the genus, \"thinking they were unusual.\" He designated them as another existing species, Peckoltia vittata, in a 2008 paper, \"although I had not been comfortable with that designation.\" He examined them again in September and discovered they were different from Peckoltia vittata. After talking it over with his colleagues, they realized he was a clear ringer for Greedo. \"As a 7-year-old kid, I watched \"Star Wars\" in the theater, and it was a life-changing experience for me,\" said Armbruster. \"I became a lifelong fan, and I now share that with my son. Greedo has always been a personal favorite of mine.\" Greedo became the object of controversy when Lucasfilm re-released the original Star Wars trilogy in 1997. A reworked scene showed Greedo firing a shot at Solo before Solo fired back. In the 1977 release, Han is the only one to fire, prompting backlash from fans and giving rise to the phrase \"Han Shot First.\"","highlights":"Catfish with large, dark eyes and puckered lips named after bounty hunter Greedo .\nGreedo is the bounty hunter killed by Han Solo in \"Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\""}

{"article":"(CNN)Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) has taken delivery of the Izumo, the largest Japanese military vessel to see service since World War II. The warship was unveiled at a ceremony at the Yokusuka naval base near Yokohama, also home to the U.S Navy's Seventh Fleet. The Izumo has a crew of 470, and with a standard displacement of 19,500 tones (24,000 tonnes at full load, according to military publication Jane's), it is as large as the storied Yamato-class battleships which fought U.S. naval forces in the Pacific theater of World War II. The wreck of one of the two Yamato-class battleships, the Musashi, was discovered early in March 2015 by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. At 241 meters (791 feet) in length, the Izumo is 51 meters (167 ft) longer than the Hyuga, another helicopter carrier which was, until now, the MDSF's largest vessel. Regional neighbors and rivals questioned the legitimacy of such a ship for purely defensive purposes, pointing out that, due to its size and deck configuration it could be repurposed as an aircraft carrier -- a class banned under Japan's pacifist constitution. \"The Izumo proves that Japan has the technical capabilities and demand to develop aircraft carriers. It's also possible that Japan may explore the possibility during the Izumo's service,\" Li Jie, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Chinese state-backed Global Times newspaper. However, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told reporters in Yokohama that the MSDF did not intend to use it in this way. \"We are not thinking about using this as an aircraft carrier,\" he said, saying that the lack of hangers and service bays, along with a deck unsuitable for takeoffs and landings, meant that the Izumo wasn't designed for fixed-wing aircraft. He said that it needed to be as large as it is so it could host joint operations and act as a command center. He insisted that the new addition to Japan's maritime forces was designed for peaceful purposes. \"The vessel can serve in a wide range of roles including peacekeeping operations, international disaster relief and aid.\" He added that its helicopter capabilities -- it can host seven anti-submarine patrol helicopters, plus two rescue and transport helicopters, the Japan Times reported -- would aid in the detection of sophisticated Chinese submarines. Japan, along with the Philippines and Vietnam, is engaged in territorial disputes with China over the sovereignty of islands in the South China Sea, and Kazuhisa Ogawa, a defense analyst at the Strategic Research Institute of International Change in Japan, says that, in combination with Japan's other helicopter carriers, the Izumo could be used to \"regain remote islets.\" He also downplayed China's suggestions that the size of the Izumo represented an escalation of Japan's military ambitions, telling CNN that although it is the biggest Japanese military ship since World War II, it is only a fifth of the size of the USS George Washington. \"It would cost five times Japan's current defense spending for the SDF to have an independent operational capability. The Japanese public would not take that kind of risk,\" he said. The commissioning of the Izumo comes amid heightened tensions between Japan and its neighbors China and South Korea. In July. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe allowed for a reinterpreting of Japan's constitution, paving the way for more active military engagement overseas. The Chinese government has also invited the Japanese leader to attend a ceremony in the Chinese capital in September to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. Japan's handling of its wartime aggression is frequently criticized by China and other Asian nations -- it is often accused of downplaying its actions during the war. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Tuesday that the Chinese government had contacted \"all relevant countries\" with a view to attending. The Japanese Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper said that, as the celebrations will feature a military parade, Abe is \"unlikely to attend.\" It quoted an unnamed Foreign Ministry official as saying: \"While the Japanese government is demanding China improve the transparency of its defense spending, attendance of the prime minister is impossible.\" Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga has previously said that China should work on developing a future-looking cooperative relationship with Japan, rather than highlighting Japan's previous, 70-year-old indiscretions. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki in Tokyo contributed to this report.","highlights":"Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force takes receipt of newly-commissioned helicopter carrier .\nThe ship, named the Izumo, is the largest Japanese military ship since the Second World War .\nCritics in neighboring countries say the ship could contravene Japan's pacifist constitution ."}

{"article":"Orlando, Florida (CNN)Kaka grins as he recalls being mobbed by a boisterous crowd chanting his name at a Florida airport arrivals hall in the early summer of 2014. \"It was very nice ... a good surprise for me,\" he said, wistfully casting his mind back to images of football fans waving flags and hollering his name. The graceful Brazilian midfielder once of Sao Paulo, AC Milan and Real Madrid has become used to such fevered adulation over the years. A glittering decade playing in Europe brought Champions Leagues, Scudettos,La Liga titles and, of course, a devoted following. But it wasn't the loyal apostles of Madrid's Ultras Sur, the Curva Sud Milano or even his compatriots in the unmistakeable yellow of A Selecao with whom he won a World Cup in 2002 that provided the heroes welcome in question. Instead it was a passionate crowd festooned in the less heralded purple and white of Orlando City, one of the newest franchises in Major League Soccer. Only founded in 2010, the team will make its MLS bow this week. But interest was high that a former Ballon d'Or winner would be coming to play his football in a place more commonly associated with Disney World and Universal Studios. Local news stations carried live pictures of Kaka's plane touching down. Leaving the airport to officially sign his contract even became a mission in itself, so keen were the Orlando natives to get a glimpse of their first designated signing. \"When I arrived in the airport, this crowd (was) singing the team songs, singing my name. Also (at) my presentation downtown, I was very, very happy,\" Kaka said. \"Now, the city is start(ing) to enjoy this moment and everybody's looking forward to our, first game on March 8.\" Such frenzied devotion in the U.S., so long resistant to the charms of the world's most popular sport, may seem strange to fans in Europe and South America, football's historical and cultural heartlands. The MLS is now approaching its 20th season but has long been pejoratively regarded outside North America as a retirement home for once top-level players -- a plastic, commercially driven product devoid of any real identity offering one last payday before the limbs give out. Aged 32 and no doubt the recipient of a handsome remuneration package, there will be many who question whether Kaka is merely jetting in to boost his bank balance before calling it a day. Relaxed and polite as ever, Kaka himself is having none of this. In all honesty, it's hard to imagine a man as conscientious and clearly committed to his faith moving anywhere solely for the money. There was once a time when every Kaka goal resulted in a lifting of his jersey to reveal a T-shirt which stated \"Jesus loves you\" or \"I belong to Jesus.\" These days, the celebration of choice is usually the upward point and grateful look to the heavens. \"In every moment of my life, not just on the field, but also off the field, my faith, Jesus Christ and the bible helped me a lot. \"So every time that I can I do my prayer, I read the bible, go to the church. These things help me a lot to stay in good peace on my mind.\" His faith was never more important than as an 18-year-old in Sao Paulo when he suffered a serious neck injury. \"All the doctors said look you are lucky to walk in this moment, so you need to be happy you can walk,\" he said. \"And my question was 'but I can play?' Everybody said 'we don't know, we have to wait.' So, in that moment, the faith helped me a lot. \"God always supported me at every moment and after two months I start to play as a professional player. It was a very important moment of my life.\" Talking of moments, Kaka describes how moving to the U.S. was always a long-term ambition. Upon meeting Orlando City majority owner Flavio Augusto da Silva in Brazil a number of years ago, the pair discussed the potential of working together. Moves to LA Galaxy and New York Red Bulls were mooted in the interim but never materialized for various reasons. It was then the Orlando opportunity arose which he was only too happy to take. Kaka points to other high-profile players like Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, David Villa and Sebastian Giovinco being attracted to the league as proof of its appeal and progress. \"There's a lot of good players that could have another team in Europe but they chose to come here. I think it's a good moment to be in this league. In a few years, we will listen a lot about the MLS,\" he said. He might just have a point. The forthcoming MLS season marks the first of a new eight-year TV deal and media rights partnership with ESPN, FOX Sports and Univision. On top of this, average attendance across the league for the 2014 season was the highest in recent MLS history, according to data on the MLS Attendance blog. Yet questions remain over the long-term profitability of some teams. A report from Forbes magazine in late 2013 found only 10 out of 19 MLS franchises were making any money. Critics might also argue that the players mentioned by Kaka are past their very best with the possible exception of the 28-year-old Giovinco. Unsurprisingly, the former FIFA World Player of the Year doesn't see it that we way. He reveals he still harbors ambitions of continuing his international career and even making the World Cup in Russia 2018. Last October saw a surprise recall under returning Brazil manager, Dunga. \"I have a three-year contract with Orlando, and at least these three. In four years, we have another World Cup,\" said Kaka, who will be 36 in 2018. \" If I feel good and Brazil needs me (it) will be a good way to stop playing. So I hope I can play another World Cup.\" Just mentioning the World Cup in the presence of a Brazilian can be tense after the trauma of last year's incredible semifinal in Belo Horizonte. The 7-1 home-turf mauling at the hands of eventual winners Germany was variously described in the unforgiving Brazilian press at the time as \"an historic humiliation\" and the \"humiliation of all humiliations.\" Never before has a Brazilian side looked so inept, so fragile, so lacking in class, flair or bereft of that ephemeral quality known locally as \"joga bonito.\" \"That was very hard for us,\" said Kaka even though he wasn't selected for the tournament. \"That defeat in our country, in the semifinal World Cup it's very, very difficult. But I think we can use this to change some in the Brazilian football. \"A lot of players play outside (of Brazil). Most of them play in Europe, but we have to change something organization in the soccer in Brazil. \"For me, the most important thing is the organization and the calendar. It's a lot of games, so the players can't play every game in a good shape. \"The level is a little bit down in this moment. Also, the youth team is not what (we're) used to being in Brazil, so we need to wake up.\" Kaka hopes that many of his compatriots will keep up with the MLS and his career in Orlando now that he's exhibiting his much admired talents there. \"We have a Facebook page in Brazil, Orlando City Brazil, and a lot of fans (are) enjoying the page. A lot of Brazilians are looking here now,\" he said. \"I think this season will be great for us in Brazil. A lot of people will see the Orlando City playing in MLS.\" And despite earlier talk of an extended international career and making World Cup 2018, there really is only one goal at the forefront of his mind. \"My goal is always to win. I hope one day I can win the league with Orlando City,\" he said. \"For this year, probably we want to arrive in the playoffs. Let's put the target a little bit down, but I still have ... this goal that we can win the league one day.\"","highlights":"Kaka gearing up to appear in the MLS for Orlando City .\nFormer AC Milan and Real Madrid star keen to resurrect international career .\n89-times capped star says he wants to play in 2018 World Cup in Russia ."}

{"article":"(CNN)A Massachusetts teenager faces a pretrial hearing in April on involuntary manslaughter charges for allegedly sending text messages urging a friend to commit suicide, even after he expressed second thoughts, authorities said Saturday. Michelle Carter, 18, was indicted on February 5. Conrad Roy, 18, of Fairhaven and Mattapoisett, Massachusetts, was found dead in his car of apparent carbon monoxide poisoning on July 13, Sgt. Kevin Kobza, public information officer for the Fairhaven Police Department, said Saturday. At one point the night of Roy's death, he exited the vehicle and communicated to Carter that he was having second thoughts about taking his own life, Kobza told CNN. Carter then urged him via text message to get back in the car, Kobza said. Upon searching Roy's cell phone, police discovered \"hundreds\" of texts between Roy and Carter, many which contained language from Carter that encouraged Roy to take his own life, Kobza said. \"Instead of attempting to assist him or notify his family or school officials, Ms. Carter is alleged to have strongly influenced his decision to take his own life, encouraged him to commit suicide and guided him in his engagement of activities which led to his death,\" Gregg Miliote, director of communications for the Bristol County District Attorney's Office, said in a statement. Carter's lawyer, Joseph Cataldo, said Saturday that the evidence will show this was not manslaughter and that Carter attempted to console Roy on \"many occasions.\" \"The facts that have been given out to the public at this point put her in the worst possible light,\" Cataldo said. \"My heart goes out to the family, but this was a young man who planned this for months and months.\" On a Twitter page confirmed by the District Attorney's Office to be Carter's, several photos and tweets about Roy have been posted since his death. One tweet reads, \"I can't believe today already marks 4 months without you. I love you and miss you always Conrad...\" In September 2014, Carter organized a softball tournament in Roy's memory and raised $2,300 for mental health awareness, according to Kobza. Carter was arraigned on the indictment on February 6 in New Bedford Juvenile Court, released on $2,500 bail and told not to use social media, according to Miliote. Carter was indicted as a youthful offender because she was not yet 18 when the alleged crimes occurred. Youthful offenders are tried in juvenile court but the proceedings are public, Cataldo said. Because of a familial relationship he has with the victim's family, Bristol County District Attorney Thomas Quinn recused himself from the investigation and prosecution of this case, the District Attorney's Office said. Carter's pretrial hearing is set for April 17.","highlights":"Conrad Roy, 18, was found dead of apparent carbon monoxide poisoning, police said .\nPolice: A search of his phone found texts from a friend urging him to commit suicide ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Italian authorities have arrested 42 people suspected of belonging to a mafia network in southern Italy, some of whom are accused of extorting tens of thousands of euros from businesses monthly, police said Tuesday. Among the evidence: A piece of paper, hidden in a bicycle handlebar, that listed businesses that the crime syndicate was extorting, according to the Carabinieri, Italy's military police. The Carabinieri said they made the arrests while raiding homes in 11 provinces. The crime network is based in Casal di Principe, a village roughly 20 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of Naples, police said. The mafia network extorted shop owners to the tune of 200,000 euros a month and extorted operators of slot machines and online gambling a further 100,000 euros monthly, the Carabinieri said. The arrests stem from an investigation that started in October 2012. Investigators also found notebooks with the group's organizational chart and names of jailed associates who still were on the mafia payroll, according to the Carabinieri. The note in the bicycle handlebar was among other \"pizzini,\" or little pieces of paper allegedly used by mafia members to exchange information, that investigators discovered in the probe, the military police said. In Villa Literno, close to Casal di Principe, investigators discovered a bunker that allegedly was used to hide fugitive affiliates of the mafia, the Carabinieri said. An anti-mafia prosecutor in Naples filed charges against the 42, including mafia association, extortion and illegal possession of weapons.","highlights":"Police say a note hidden in a bike's handlebar listed extorted businesses .\nThe crime network is based in Casal di Principe, a village near Naples, police say .\nArrests stemmed from investigation that began in 2012 ."}
{"article":"(CNN)The Queens, New York, district attorney called it \"every subway commuter's worst nightmare.\" A man waiting for a train was pushed off the subway platform into the path of an arriving train on December 27, 2012. He died instantly. Erika Menendez of Queens, was charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime. Menendez told authorities she \"pushed a Muslim off the train tracks\" because she'd hated Hindus and Muslims ever since the 9\/11 terrorist attacks, according to Queens District Attorney Richard Brown. Menendez, 33, was allowed Friday to plead guilty to first-degree manslaughter, Brown said in a statement. The judge indicated he would sentence her to 22 to 25 years in prison on April 29. Conviction on the original charge would have resulted in a tougher sentence -- 25 years to life imprisonment, Meris Campbell, spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, said Saturday. The district attorney's office accepted the plea because Menendez promised not to appeal and because of Menendez's \"substantial psychiatric history and serious drug problem,\" Campbell said. \"We are assured she'll serve a substantial amount of time behind bars.\" The victim, Sunando Sen, 46, was not Muslim. A friend told CNN he grew up in a Hindu family. The incident happened at night at the 40 Street-Lowery Street station in Sunnyside, Queens. Witnesses told police a woman paced the platform and talked to herself before pushing Sen as the 11-car train entered the station. Security video showed a woman running from the scene. Menendez was recognized on a street in Brooklyn by a passerby who had seen the video and called 911, police said. \"The defendant is accused of committing what is every subway commuter's worst nightmare -- being suddenly and senselessly pushed into the path of an oncoming train,\" Brown said Friday. \"The victim was allegedly shoved from behind and had no chance to defend himself.\" A call and email to Menendez's defense lawyer were not immediately returned Saturday.

{"article":"(CNN)One person died and another was severely injured after a cliff collapsed on the Pacific Coast north of San Francisco, the National Park Service said. The two people fell about 70 feet (21 meters) Saturday when part of the Arch Rock overlook at Point Reyes National Seashore gave way. The day before the collapse, the Point Reyes National Seashore had posted a photo on Facebook of a fissure in the rock structure -- with a warning to use caution. \"Visitors using Bear Valley Trail to Arch Rock -- watch out! At the very end of the trail, the cliff is breaking away -- seen here in a photo taken Wednesday,\" the government organization said. The NPS said hazardous conditions had been reported to it on March 19. John Dell'Osso from the Point Reyes National Seashore told CNN that it had posted warnings after being notified last Thursday that a crack had formed in the arch. \"We posted all kinds of notices up and down that particular trail, which is how probably how 99% of the people who would hike that far would (go), and all around our visitors' center in Trail Heads, just to warn people of the hazard that was out there,\" Dell'Osso said. \"We didn't know what could happen and what unfortunately did happen is on Saturday afternoon a large portion of that overlook actually collapsed down onto the beach and partly onto the ocean,\" he said. \"The tragedy is that there were two people that were standing out there who fell with all of that rubble.\" On Monday, the Marin County Sheriff's Office named the deceased as 58-year-old Nancy Blum, from California. It said she had been hiking about 6:30 p.m. Saturday \"when a structural collapse of the rock occurred.\" After emergency personnel reached Blum and her hiking companion, she was flown to Bear Valley Ranger Station, where she was pronounced dead. The National Park Service and the county coroner's office are investigating the cause of Blum's death. \"The cause of death will be pending the completion of toxicology studies,\" the sheriff's office said in a statement. Bluffs along the California coast are known for being unstable, according to the park service. The Arch Rock trail that runs along that part of the coast has been closed until further notice.

{"article":"(CNN)From the community of Montoursville, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., to the community of Haltern am See, Germany: . We offer our heartfelt condolences for the pain you must be feeling at this time after the loss of 16 students and two teachers in the horrendous crash of Germanwings Flight 9525. There are no words of comfort that we could express that would ever be adequate. We know something about this sorrow. Almost 19 years ago our community lost 16 high school French Club students, along with five chaperones, in the crash of TWA Flight 800 off the coast of Long Island, New York. It is impossible to be prepared for such a horrific tragedy that touches so many so personally. During the dark hours of waiting for word of possible survivors from Flight 800, the pain for the family members was excruciating. As word came that there were no survivors, that all hope was extinguished, the anguish became almost unbearable. Students, former students, teachers and other community members began to fill the hallways of the high school building because they didn't know where else to go to find consolation. Local pastors, priests, teachers and counselors were also gathering at the school to offer whatever comfort could be offered in such a moment. Within hours, phone calls began pouring in from former students and teachers who were now living outside the area, offering condolences and prayers for all. Since the disaster occurred over water, the recovery of loved ones took days, and even weeks in some cases.  Positive identification of each individual lost took even longer, which only added to the anguish. The identifications came in one at a time over a period of several days; the waiting was nearly impossible to bear. School was not in session during the summer months, so students and school staff members were able to express their sense of loss as they felt necessary at any time. A community prayer service was arranged and held in the high school gymnasium to provide a place to weep together, and to share each other's pain. Local pastors and priests provided ongoing support to the families who had lost family members, and this continued for several months. Some struggled so deeply that professional counseling was suggested. Because we are a community of about 5,000 with just one high school, almost everyone opened their arms of support to those in deepest need by providing meals, baby-sitting, housecleaning and laundry services. Funeral services were held one at a time, some in the high school and others in local churches. Long lines of mourners waited in silence for the opportunity to at least offer condolences to family members. Twenty-one funeral services over a period of several days left many in the community without any more tears to cry. Within a couple of months, a memorial service was held on the local athletic field and attended by thousands. The hope was to bring closure for the community so it could attempt to return to a somewhat normal daily routine. This helped for some, but families that experienced direct loss still had a long and painful journey ahead of them.  When a parent, or someone serving as a parent, loses a child, an empty spot occurs in the heart that never heals. They may find comfort in the thought that their child is in the arms of a loving God, but that assurance does not mend the broken heart. Over time, the various families that lost their children in the tragedy formed support groups to share their loss. Many of the folks have reached out to others going through a similar type of loss to offer their comfort, and have found a little bit of personal healing in the process. In the years since the crash, many of the pastors and priests who served the families have moved away or retired from pastoral service. Those of us who counseled from the beginning have at times needed the support of one another to restore our strength and spirits to then be able to serve our own parishioners. This is the beginning of a very long journey for all those willing to serve those in such great pain at this time. At this writing I am shedding tears just recalling the events that started almost 19 years ago. If any of our experiences can assist your community of Haltern am See in getting through this horrible event, then know that it is in pain we achieve our greatest victories.","highlights":"16 high school students and 5 chaperones from Montoursville, Pa., were aboard TWA Flight 800 in 1996 .\nHaltern am See, Germany, lost 16 students and 2 teachers in Germanwings Flight 9525 .\nJerry Upling: Communities can find healing by reaching out to others, but the journey is a long one ."}
{"article":"(CNN)The end of \"Jinx,\" the six-part HBO documentary about real estate heir Robert Durst, has launched a debate about whether some potentially incriminating statements Durst made while in the bathroom to a microphone may be used in his criminal prosecution. Durst, as you probably heard, is charged with murder in a killing in California 15 years ago, and he has been suspected, but never charged, in the disappearance of his first wife in New York. Whether or not the taped words of an accused person will be admissible against him involves a look at the rules of evidence and the Constitution, as well as our fast-evolving ideas about privacy. While Durst's attorneys can make a number of arguments to suppress these statements and bar their admission at trial, the bathroom confessions will likely be factored in. Let's go over three main reasons why: . 1. Is this inadmissible hearsay? Probably not. Hearsay is defined as a statement made outside of court that is offered in court for its truth. It really just means a witness can't testify at trial about someone else's version of the facts. If a sentence starts with \"He told me\" or \"She said that,\" it's probably hearsay.  As general proposition, hearsay is supposed to be inadmissible, but the exceptions nearly swallow the rule itself -- so much so that many commentators have suggested abolishment of the exception-riddled rule itself. Perhaps the largest and best known category of hearsay exceptions is admissions and confessions. These can be admitted against a defendant. Why?  Well, the idea is that these statements are reliable. The thinking is that people don't ordinarily confess to something unless they did it. 2. Is this a violation of Durst's constitutional privilege against self-incrimination? Again, probably not. The rules of the U.S. Constitution are a different matter. The Fifth Amendment's self-incrimination clause states that \"[n]o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself ...\" By definition then, compulsory self-incrimination requires, well, \"compulsion.\"  And not just any compulsion. The kind of compulsion targeted by the Fifth Amendment is governmental coercion. Durst may still contend that his \"confession\" wasn't voluntary.  It's true that confessions deemed \"involuntary\" are often excluded at trial under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment.  However, a confession will only be considered involuntary if it is the product of police activity. Voluntariness is not an issue when admissions are made to a private person, such as a journalist. What of Durst's likely claim that the filmmakers were essentially acting as an arm of the police?  Sometimes law enforcement exercises so much control over a civilian that his private actions become police action, constitutionally speaking. This is not an easy case for a defendant to make, though.  Durst would have to establish that the HBO interviewers were direct agents of the police and that the interview was coerced by police. The police undoubtedly benefited from the work of these citizen documentarians.  But the police frequently benefit from the work of good Samaritans or citizens volunteering information, photos or iPhone videos.  The television show \"America's Most Wanted\" has been premised on this idea for decades.  Given the defendant's burden here, it's unlikely that he can convince a judge that, in light of all the circumstances, filmmakers acted as an instrument or agent of police. The bottom line is this: A voluntary confession must be the product of a rational intellect and a free will, not physical intimidation or psychological pressure. How was Durst \"pressured\" when alone in the bathroom?  However, his attorneys might argue that some mental impairment rendered him incapable of the necessary rational intellect and free will. 3. Can Durst argue for some \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" that was violated by his being taped in the bathroom? Not in our modern world, and not in this case. Perhaps in decades past, a court might be offended at an audio recording of someone in the bathroom, but things have changed. Subjects of documentaries and reality TV stars alike routinely sign contracts allowing camera crews to pin a microphone to their lapels and follow them around 24 hours a day.  Moreover, everyone in the television news business has a story about some famous correspondent going to the bathroom and forgetting about their \"hot\" mic.  In this brave new media world, the rule appears to be: You wear a lavalier microphone at your own risk. This is why defense attorneys tell clients to not give interviews.  No matter how good an interviewee a client may be, audio and video editors have an uncanny knack for isolating the less than flattering sound bites.  Admitting to killing \"them all\" would fall into this category. When it comes to giving interviews, it's probably better for defendants such as Durst to keep silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt, especially doubt of the reasonable kind.","highlights":"Robert Durst made some potentially incriminating statements at the end of HBO's \"Jinx\"\nDanny Cevallos: Durst's attorneys will want to bar their admission at trial, but they will likely be factored in ."}

{"article":"The thought may have occurred to Sam Robson that there has never been a better time to be an England Test specialist. As the nation rakes over the debris of yet another World Cup fiasco, the Test squad named on Wednesday for next month\u2019s three-match series in the Caribbean will be depicted as English cricket\u2019s chance to start the clean-up operation. And though the Australian-born Robson had his first taste of the big time last summer, he has not represented his adopted country since the Oval Test against India in August. Selection for the West Indies \u2013 for the first of 17 Tests in 10 months \u2013 will almost feel like starting afresh, all over again. Sam Robson (centre) is ready to battle for his England place after a mixed maiden summer in Test cricket . Robson celebrated his first England century in just his second Test as he scored 127 against Sri Lanka . Robson\u2019s quest to resume his opening partnership with Alastair Cook will face competition if Jonathan Trott is deemed ready to resume his England career following his stress-related condition. But the prize is glittering on the horizon: the chance to help win back the Ashes this summer. \u2018To play in an Ashes series would be massive for me,\u2019 Robson told Sportsmail. \u2018I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t super keen. But there are five Tests before then, and I\u2019m hoping first and foremost to play in them.\u2019 Robson\u2019s first challenge will be to quell the chatter about his technique and nail the only spot in the Test batting line-up that remains up for grabs. After scoring a composed century in only his second game for England, against Sri Lanka at Headingley, he began the series against India with a steady 59 at Trent Bridge. But his fortunes ebbed. Six more Test innings brought him a top score of 37. And, as one of the few batsmen not to cash in against a mediocre Indian attack, he repeatedly found himself on the wrong end of the pundits\u2019 analysis. But Robson's judgement outside off stump has been questioned after dismissals caught behind and bowled . Robson tucks into the Indian bowling at Trent Bridge last July, but failed to notch a ton against the tourists . ROBSON . Tests: 7 . Innings: 11 . Runs: 336 . Batting average: 30.54 . Hundreds: 1 . Fifties: 1 . Top score: 127 (vs Sri Lanka) TROTT . Tests: 49 . Innings: 87 . Runs: 3763 . Batting average: 46.45 . Hundreds: 9 . Fifties: 18 . Top score: 226 (vs Bangladesh) Last summer, he was caught in the cordon five times, bowled four times and lbw twice. Experts made a simple diagnosis: Robson had a flaw around off stump. \u2018It is something I\u2019m conscious of,\u2019 he said. \u2018Knowing where your off stump is as an opening batsman is crucial. I\u2019ve worked on it just as I\u2019ve worked on other areas of my game. But I\u2019m not walking out there expecting never to nick another one. \u2018I was a little bit disappointed not to get another big score last summer after I\u2019d set myself a good base. But I still look back with pride on the 3-1 series win against India, and the Test hundred was something which made me feel comfortable with the environment. \u2018There was a very welcoming culture in the dressing-room, which helped all the young guys coming in. After the disappointing loss to Sri Lanka, that helped us turn things round pretty quickly. I\u2019m hungry if I get another chance to score some big runs.\u2019 While many of the colleagues he hopes to team up with in the Caribbean have spent the last few months confirming England\u2019s traditional struggle with 50-over cricket, Robson has been assiduously working on his game in South Africa with the ECB\u2019s performance programme and the Lions. And he reserves special praise for the coaching of Andy Flower and Graham Thorpe. \u2018I\u2019ve always been someone who likes to hear as many views as possible, especially from guys who have played lots of Test cricket, and then apply it to my own game,\u2019 he said. \u2018In the end you\u2019ve got to work things out for yourself. Jonathan Trott could be ready to resume his England career, which would pile pressure on Robson's place . The 25-year-old opener has been able to learn from Andrew Strauss and Chris Rogers at Middlesex . \u2018Andy talks a lot about your approach to batting \u2013 how to score runs, as opposed to just technique. If he notices something technical, he\u2019ll say it. But he doesn\u2019t just say stuff for the sake of it. He likes to keep things simple. Graham Thorpe is the same. They spot things, but they don\u2019t go on and on.\u2019 Only 25, Robson has already been privileged to open with Andrew Strauss and Australia\u2019s Chris Rogers at Middlesex, as well as Cook last summer \u2013 that\u2019s 50 Test centuries\u2019 worth of experience to learn from at the other end. \u2018My game\u2019s in good order,\u2019 said Robson, who is currently in Abu Dhabi for a spot of pre-season training with Middlesex. \u2018I\u2019ve had enough cricket over the winter to work on it, and I feel refreshed. I feel ready to go and really hopeful of getting picked in the squad. I just want to get out there and do the job.\u2019","highlights":"England are set to name their Test squad for West Indies tour .\nSam Robson will be hoping to secure his place as opening batsman .\nAustralian-born opener was under pressure after poor series against India .\nJonathan Trott could be deemed ready to resume his England career ."}

{"article":"A lot has changed since Paul O\u2019Connell played the first of his 100 Tests more than 13 years ago. Professionalism has been the key to the former shelf-stacker\u2019s longevity, although the Irishman has not always been surrounded by such healthy company. On the week of his debut in 2002, the young and enthusiastic second-row had to share a room with former Munster team-mate Peter Clohessy. Sam Warburton of Wales and Paul O'Connell of Ireland pose with the RBS 6 Nations trophy . Paul O'Connell will lead Ireland out at the Millennium Stadium on the occasion of his 100th international cap . O'Connell prepares to offload the ball during the Ireland training session ahead of the game last week . Paul O'Connell's importance to Ireland cannot be overstated as he wins his 100th cap against Wales on Saturday. Over the past 13 years, the iconic Munster lock has become the side's beating heart and captain. 'He's an outstanding leader,' says Ireland fly-half Jonathan Sexton. 'When he speaks to the squad during the week the hairs on the back of your next stand up.' Their billets were turned into an Irish cards den in the days leading up to the Six Nations visit of Wales; a stark contrast to the preparations for this meeting at the Millennium Stadium. \u2018I was woken by the smell of cigarette smoke in my nostrils every morning,\u2019 recalled a laughing O\u2019Connell. \u2018\u201cThe Claw\u201d used to have a cigarette the moment he woke up. I was well aware from Peter that this was not the way forward! \u2018Obviously it\u2019s changed a lot since then. It\u2019s funny, there\u2019s a lot more guys to copy now then when I made my first cap. Now in the Irish camp I take a lot of advice from (strength and conditioning coach) Jason Cowman. Jonny Sexton is obviously a great guy to copy and follow.\u2019 It is testament to O\u2019Connell\u2019s longevity that half of the current Welsh coaching set-up were playing against him in that match \u2014 a record 54-10 victory at Lansdowne Road. Both Robin McBryde and Rob Howley have since escaped to the warm comfort of the tactical box where \u2014 along with Warren Gatland, Neil Jenkins and Shaun Edwards \u2014 they will be hoping to plot Ireland\u2019s downfall at the Millennium Stadium this afternoon. O'Connell powers over for a try in the 54-10 victory for Ireland over Wales back in 2002, his debut . Half of the current Welsh coaching set-up were playing O'Connell at Landsdowne Road in his first game . All eyes will be on the battle of the skies as the hosts look to end Ireland\u2019s Grand Slam push and keep alive their own championship hopes. They have been working overtime to nullify the aerial bombardment from Sexton and Conor Murray, with scrum-half Rhys Webb promising not to repeat the mistakes that England made in Dublin two weeks ago. \u2018I don\u2019t know if England did much analysis on them,\u2019 said Webb. \u2018They didn\u2019t seem to put much pressure on nine and 10 whatsoever. We need to be on the money and we know there is no margin for error.\u2019 The heavily influenced kicking strategy has been criticised for lacking entertainment value. Rhys Webb admits attractive rugby will come second as Wales look to derail Ireland's Grand Slam hopes . All Blacks boss Steve Hansen recently said that rugby is \u2018geared towards defences that inhibit attack\u2019 and McBryde is predicting another war of attrition in the Welsh capital. \u2018Attractive rugby will come second,\u2019 said the 44-year-old. \u2018That\u2019s the nature of the game at the moment and unfortunately the spectators have got to pay a price for that.\u2019 It promises to be an intense tactical battle between Gatland and counterpart Joe Schmidt, with the former subjected to a bitter personal attack by retired Ireland lock Neil Francis during the week. Gatland was said to have \u2018the intellectual properties of a tub of Flora\u2019, although O\u2019Connell holds the Kiwi in much higher regard. Webb says Wales need 'to be on the money' in their RBS 6 Nations-defining clash with Ireland . Wales captain Sam Warburton makes his way into the stadium for Wales training ahead of Six Nations clash . \u2018For as long as I can remember we\u2019ve being trying to poach ideas from Warren Gatland,\u2019 said O\u2019Connell. \u2018We played Wasps with Munster in 2003 or 2004 and they were so far ahead in terms of how they were playing and how the players were prepared from an S&C (strength and conditioning) and nutritional point of view. It was a rude awakening. He makes complicated things very simple and he probably pioneered that way of thinking. \u2018At the start of the championship, Joe said the Wales-England game was going to be the standard-bearer. Two years ago Ireland beat them in the first game and they just built and built and built until they absolutely erupted in that final game against England. \u2018They\u2019ll feel the same thing is happening now.\u2019 Kicking game . In Conor Murray and Jonathan Sexton, Ireland have the world\u2019s in-form kicking half-back combination. Their aerial game-plan was predictable against England yet Stuart Lancaster did not have the players at his disposable to stop it. Wales, however, have one of the best defensive back-threes in the world and Leigh Halfpenny is a master at limiting the space to kick into. How well Ireland anticipate that - perhaps using Sexton as a looping runner, if the wingers drop back - will be highly significant. Set-piece . At 6ft 9in and 6ft 11in, Luke Charteris of Wales and Devin Toner of Ireland are two of the tallest players in the competition. They are both extremely difficult to beat on their own line-out throw, while they can be equally disruptive towards their opponents\u2019. Their long limbs are used to try and steal ball, although that can leave the defending side open to attack from the driving maul, where both Wales and Ireland are particularly effective. Picking the right moments to challenge will be pivotal; a responsibility that falls on the shoulders of Alun-Wyn Jones and Paul O\u2019Connell. Breakdown . Welsh defence coach Shaun Edwards claims his players are the best in the world at contesting the post-tackle area. However, they will face their toughest breakdown battle yet against Ireland, who won 23 turnovers to nine against England in round three. Warren Gatland\u2019s game-plan relies heavily on quick recycled ball and Ireland will look to slow that down to limit the risk from the likes of Jamie Roberts and George North. Getting on the right side of referee Wayne Barnes will be key, because Halfpenny and Sexton are two of the world\u2019s leading goal-kickers.","highlights":"Ireland's iconic captain Paul O'Connell wins his 100th cap against Wales .\nA lot has changed since the Munster man made his debut in 2002 .\nBut Wales\u00a0scrum-half Rhys Webb has plan to ruin the big day .\nWebb says he did not agree with way England approached Ireland game ."}
{"article":"(CNN)When it comes to the U.S. fraternity and sorority system, it's a disturbing truth: Life is largely segregated by race, money and power; and, yet, most of us find that unsurprising. This week, however, we got more evidence this callous status quo needs to change. The push came in the form of a nine-second YouTube video, which I'm sure you've seen by now. It reportedly shows members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity at the University of Oklahoma chanting these chilling lines: \"There will never be a ni**** SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me.\" \"The students on the bus clap and pump their fists as they boisterously chant,\" CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin writes, describing a clip that rocketed around social media, leading OU's president, David Boren, to rightfully shutter and ban that fraternity from the school. The video is hard to watch, but I have a feeling it's one we need to see, both because it hints at the inner workings of certain Greek organizations, and because it shows the persistent racism that still exists in the United States. I'm thankful someone -- someone who was on the bus to witness the racist chants -- was brave enough to film this and to help it become public. That alone should give some reason for hope. Others weren't, but I was shocked by the video. This, in 2015? In my home state? Both of my parents participated in Greek life in Oklahoma, but at a different university. I know from their stories that these groups can be the basis for lifelong friendships and civic engagement. What happened on the bus at OU doesn't negate their positive experiences. But it should cause us to question a system that is inherently built around the concept of exclusion. Sometimes students are excluded from Greek life, in theory, because they're seen as uncool or don't \"fit in\" with a particular chapter. But we'd be kidding ourselves if we didn't realize that, often, a person's race -- or sexual orientation, for that matter --  factors into this you're-in, you're-out process. Oklahoma school's response to video caught between racism, Civil Rights Act . And it's hard for me not to see the SAE video as a manifestation -- an admittedly extreme one -- of this exclusionist ideology. This is a case of dangerous group-think run amok. In a system that remains largely divided by race, perhaps videos like this shouldn't be so surprising. That's the view of Matthew Hughey, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut who studies racial dynamics in American Greek life. The U.S. fraternity and sorority system is \"a form of American apartheid,\" he told me in an interview on Monday. Instead of thinking of the Oklahoma fraternity members as \"bad apples,\" he said, we should see them as part of a \"bad orchard.\" That orchard includes, but isn't limited to, Greek organizations, he told me. It also includes the rest of us and our country's racist history. \"Largely, these organizations reflect a supersegregated and unequal system that is made up of college and alumni members all over the world,\" he said. Sigma Alpha Epsilon is no stranger to scandal and sanctions . Comparative data on the racial make-up of these organizations is impossible to come by, but anecdotal evidence suggests these groups are starkly divided by race. From 2003 to 2006, Hughey spent time interviewing students from Greek organizations at three colleges on the East Coast. \"At the time of interviews, the average membership size of the organizations was 63 members, and there was an average of 2.4 nonwhite members per organization,\" he wrote in a 2010 paper published by Society for the Study of Social Problems. That's 3.8% minority members, in those instances. Hughey's sample size is small but his results also echo what anyone who's spent time on a college campus knows to be true: There are white fraternities and there are black ones. Sometimes we even dare call them that. Far too many of us, especially those of us with friends and family members who have participated in Greek life, either are in denial about this -- or we choose to see egregious cases of racism, sexism and violence in the U.S. Greek system as somehow isolated. It's clear that's not the case. \"In 1992, Texas A&M University fined its chapter $1,000 after it threw a 'jungle party' attended by frat brothers in blackface. Then in 2002, Syracuse University suspended its chapter after one of its members went to a bar in blackface. As recently as 2013, the fraternity got suspended following allegations it had photographed African American students while pledges recited rap lyrics laced with racial slurs,\" according to The Washington Post's Terrence McCoy. All of that was just SAE. Other examples are easy to come by, too. According to The New York Daily News, here's the text of an invitation to a 2013 Asian-themed Kappa Sigma party at Duke University: \"We look forward to having Mi, Yu, You and Yo Friends over for some Sake. Chank You.\" And in January 2014, according to The New York Times, Arizona State University investigated an MLK-day party hosted by the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity in which \"nonblack students mocked blacks by donning loose basketball jerseys, flashing gang signs and drinking from hollowed-out watermelons.\" It's clear there is a recurring problem here -- one that needs fixing. One easy place to start would be simply getting more information. Why don't universities force these organizations to report their demographics so we can see exactly how segregated this system really is? Hughey told me that data isn't available. Then we could know the answers to some interesting questions: How segregated are Greek organizations? Are certain schools or organizations more integrated than others? What's the trend over time? Is there progress? John Lewis on Oklahoma students: 'They should be gone' Universities also should assess how and why they support these organizations. Do traditionally black and Latino fraternities get as much school funding and attention as the white frats? If not, why? And why are these groups so incredibly divided in the first place? What does that do to the student body as a whole? I'm not calling for an end to the Greek system. But it's a system that needs to take a hard look in the mirror and make some real changes. \"Any time there are racist remarks made, we must speak up as Americans,\" Boren, the OU president, said in a news conference. He added that he hopes the SAE students \"think long and hard\" about the incident as they pack up and vacate their fraternity house early this week. \"I hope they think long and hard about how words can injure and hurt other people,\" he said. The rest of us should do that, too.","highlights":"CNN's John Sutter talks with a sociologist about race in the fraternity system .\nThis follows controversy over racism in a University of Oklahoma fraternity ."}
{"article":"Ryan Giggs insists Angel di Maria is not suffering from a crisis of confidence and expects him to play a major role in Manchester United's push for FA Cup glory and Champions League qualification. Di Maria became British football's most expensive signing when he joined United from Real Madrid for \u00a359.7million last August but the Argentina World Cup star has struggled to justify that huge fee since scoring three times in his first five appearances. The 27-year-old wideman has netted only once in 19 games and been substituted in United's last three Barclays Premier League matches. Angel di Maria (left) has been backed by Ryan Giggs to show his quality for Manchester United . But United assistant manager Giggs is adamant Di Maria has a big part to play in the club achieving their end-of-season goals, starting with Arsenal's FA Cup quarter-final visit to Old Trafford on Monday night. 'I think his confidence is fine,' Giggs told Press Association Sport. 'He's a quality player and we'll be looking for him to produce because it is big game after big game now. Assistant manager Giggs denied claims that the 27-year-old was suffering from confidence issues . 'Players get used to different leagues, sometimes quickly and sometimes it takes a bit of time. 'He had a really good start to the season but with players who take risks and who can win games it's always difficult to be consistent because they will try things that other players won't do. 'They're capable of doing that and that's why they're match-winners and the best players.' United are involved in a thrilling race for Champions League football with Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham and Southampton still chasing a top-four Premier League finish as well as top two Chelsea and Manchester City. The summer transfer from Real Madrid has scored only once in 19 appearances for his new club . Louis van Gaal's side are currently fourth after losing only two of their last 18 league matches and, although the nature of United's performances have often been criticised, Giggs says that form counts for far more at this stage of the season. 'This is the time really when results are the top focus and then the performances will come and the confidence you get from that,' said Giggs, who again denied media talk of a rift with Van Gaal by saying they had a 'great working relationship'. 'I think we've tried a lot of systems this year and obviously the manager's new to the players and new to the league, so that's going to take time. 'But over the last three months or so we've only been beaten twice and we're in pretty good form. Fabricio Coloccini disposes Di Maria at St James' Park where the midfielder was later substituted . 'It's tight and all the teams up there are in relatively good form. 'It could come to a few head-to-heads and we've got to play a few of the top teams yet, so it's going to be exciting right to the end.' Before then, however, United are focusing on the FA Cup and opponents against whom Giggs memorably scored an FA Cup semi-final winner in the club's 1999 'Treble' year. United have won the competition a record 11 times - a total cup holders Arsenal matched last year by beating Hull at Wembley - but not since 2004 when Giggs was part of the side which beat Millwall 3-0 at the Millennium Stadium in his native Cardiff. 'We've got so much history in the cup that it's long overdue,' Giggs said. Adnan Januzaj replaces the winger who was taken off for the third consecutive Premier League match . 'The club as a whole, the players and the fans are desperate to get to Wembley. 'We've had great battles and tussles over the years with Arsenal, especially in the cup. 'Of course, I've got fond memories of the semi-final (1999) and they beat us in the final (2005), but hopefully we can get through to the semis because whoever goes through in this tie has a great chance of winning the cup.' Giggs won the FA Cup four times during a celebrated United senior playing career which spanned an incredible 24 seasons but admits he is learning all the time on the coaching front. The former Real Madrid man failed to make an impact during United's last match against Newcastle . 'I've enjoyed every minute working under Louis,' Giggs said. 'He's been brilliant with me and we've helped each other along the way. 'He's come into a new league which I know all about. I'm starting all over again with coaching and serving an apprenticeship and who better to learn from than someone who is a great leader and has won so much over the years? 'I'm learning all the time and just trying to prepare myself the best I can that if I do become a manager I'm best equipped.'

{"article":"(CNN)A dark intersection. A church van full of parishioners. And tragedy. That's about all police in Glades County, Florida, had to work with early Monday, hours after a van with 18 people inside ran a stop sign, crossed a four-lane highway and plunged into a shallow water-filled ditch. Eight people died. Ten others, including a 4-year-old child, were injured, according to police. Investigators don't know why it happened,  Florida Highway Patrol spokesman Lt. Greg Bueno told CNN affiliate WPBF. The driver died, and police haven't been able to interview passengers yet. \"Our hearts go out to the families of the victims,\" Bueno said. \"It breaks your heart to see something like this happen.\" Some relatives of the crash victims, all of whom were from the Independent Haitian Assembly of God in Fort Pierce, gathered at the rural intersection Monday morning. Others went to the church. \"We've lost a lot of family members, church family,\" Phillipe Dorce, who said he lost his father, told WPBF. \"All we can do is pray (to) God to help us out. Pray for us. It's very sad for us.\" Linda Dolce told the news site TCPalm.com that her grandmother died in the crash. She'd arrived from Haiti six years ago. \"She loved singing and helping people,\" TCPalm.com quoted her as saying. \"She was exciting; she was the best lady to us.\" Laura Lochard told the site that her uncle died in the crash, leaving behind four children, the youngest of which is 16, whom he brought to the United States from Haiti. He was like a father to her, too, she said. \"It's never easy to lose a person, but I have to be strong,\" she told the site. \"I'll never forget his smile.\" A pastor at the church, Sereste Doresma told CNN that parishioners had attended a revival in Fort Myers and had left Sunday afternoon. \"This is a very difficult day for us today,\" he said. The van apparently was traveling east on State Road 78 when it ran a stop sign at U.S. Highway 27 early Monday, authorities said. It then crossed all four lanes of U.S. 27 and stopped in a ditch that was partially filled with water. No one saw the accident on the rural stretch of roadway that's frequented mostly by commercial traffic, Bueno said. One of the passengers flagged down a passing vehicle, whose driver called police, the trooper said. Police had to remove the seats of the van to remove passengers, Bueno said. Among other things, investigators are looking into the capacity of the van. It appeared to be rated for 16 passengers, Bueno said. Of the passengers, all were adults except for the 4-year-old, who was in stable condition at a  hospital, Bueno said. Two of the adult passengers were in critical condition, he said. Passengers were being treated at four hospitals.","highlights":"\"We've lost a lot of family members, church family,\" a man whose father died tells CNN affiliate WPBF .\nEight people are dead, 10 are injured after a church van crash in Florida early Monday .\nInvestigators don't know why the van ran a stop sign and plunged into a shallow canal ."}
{"article":"A rural snake catcher could not believe his eyes when he saw an image of an eastern brown snake stealing a sausage right off a barbeque. But after being assured by his best friend, who took the image, Newcastle reptile controller Geoff Delooze now believes the image is authentic, and it is no fake snake . Mr Delooze told Daily Mail Australia he had never seen anything like the image, which was taken at a picnic on the Blue Mountains, on all his years on the job. The bizarre image shows an eastern brown snake eating a sausage whole straight off a barbeque . \u2018I couldn\u2019t believe it. My best mate took the images from a picnic he was having.

{"article":"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)For almost a week, avalanches caused by heavy snowstorms have killed 196 people in the mountainous province of Panjshir, Afghanistan, officials said on Monday. Ten new avalanches were reported early Monday morning, without any casualties.

{"article":"Dhanusha, Nepal (CNN)At Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport, hundreds of migrant workers line up daily at the immigration counters, clutching newly printed passports and boarding passes. Many of them, though, are clueless as to where they're headed. As a frequent traveler to the country, I've been approached many times by these men, asking me to help fill out their departure forms. Usually, when I ask what country they're traveling to, I get the same answer: \"I'm not sure.\" They seem weary and lost but still hopeful that they can make their lives better. This time, however, I'm at the airport to follow up on the repatriation of the most unfortunate of these migrant workers -- far too many of them make the return journey in caskets. Almost every day, the remains of three or four workers arrive back in Nepal from the Middle East, according to Bhola Prasad Siwakoti, the secretary of the Nepalese Ministry of Labor and Manpower. Every other day, at least one dead body arrives from Qatar, he said. \"Nepali migrant workers have the lowest per capita income in Qatar,\" says Suryanath Mishra, who served as ambassador to Qatar from 2007 to 2012. \"They get exploited the most out of all the migrant workers.\" He cites lack of education and technical skills as the main causes. We are waiting for the body of Kishun Das, who left Nepal for Qatar only eight months ago. The 38-year old was his family's breadwinner and the father of five children. His younger brother, Bishun, is at the airport to receive the body. He also works in Qatar and is in Nepal on leave. I ask him why he's alone. \"We don't have money to bring other family members to receive the body,\" he says.  \"But they have been calling me every other minute asking for the update.\" His phone rings. \"I'm at the administration filling out the paperwork.\" he tells the caller on his phone. \"No, he isn't getting any compensation.\" With more than 350,000 migrant workers, Nepalis make up the second-biggest community in Qatar, after Indians, the embassy in Qatar claims. When contacted about the deaths of foreign workers in Qatar, a spokesman for the labor ministry said that all workers deserve to be protected against exploitation. Saad Al-Mraikhi estimated that some 400 Indian and Nepalese workers die each year in Qatar. \"It is desperately unfortunate that any worker should die overseas, in a foreign land, away from their family,\" the spokesman said. \"But it would be wrong, we believe, to allow the statistics to be consistently distorted to suggest that all deaths in a population of 1.5 million people are apparently the result of workplace conditions, either directly or indirectly, which is the prevailing and erroneous narrative.\" Al-Mraikhi spoke about recent changes in his country, including the introduction of a wage protection system, improved living conditions and increased penalties for companies that violate rules. \"While the vast majority of workers in Qatar are fairly treated, we recognise that a minority are not.  That is why we are reforming labour laws and practices,\" he said in a statement. As we wait at the airport, a Qatar Airways plane lands. At 7:40 pm, it is the last of three that depart and arrive every day. Before Qatar won the right to stage the FIFA World Cup in 2022 and embarked on a hugely ambitious, holistic construction plan to support it, it was a single flight a day. Hundreds of passengers disembark from the plane. \"They are mostly migrant workers returning home,\" an airport official tells us. We spot a cargo worker transporting a bright red box carrying the body of Kishun. Even in a country where even a fight between two stray dogs can gather a sizable crowd, coffin arrivals don't seem to attract many spectators. The scene has become all too common. The coffin is loaded on to a jeep provided for free by the Nepali government. We follow it on the journey to the family's village in Dhanusha district, a seven-hour drive from Kathmandu. \"Normally, vehicles are not allowed to drive on this highway after 8 p.m. because of the dangerous condition of some of the roads at night, but since I'm carrying a coffin, the police let me go,\" the driver of the jeep tells us. The Nepali government has eight vehicles designated to deliver coffins. They're kept busy. \"They call me the coffin guy,\" the driver says with a dark smirk. At around 1 a.m., we stop at a roadside shack. All of us eat except for Das' brother. \"I'm mourning. For religious purposes, I need to remain pure. So, I can't eat anything,\" he says. I see him buying alcohol shortly after. \"I'm too stressed because of my brother's death. I need to comfort myself.\" Back in Qatar, where alcohol is banned, he and his friends manage to fulfill their needs courtesy of the local black market, he tells us. \"It (the alcohol) is of very poor quality, but that is our only option,\" he adds. Even before we arrive at the village just at the break of dawn, we hear the howling. Dozens of villagers have already gathered at Das' home. His father cries out in agony, \"Hey Lord, what have you done?\" Then he faints. All the family members shout at the coffin. The wailing and shouting is almost deafening. And it goes on for hours. As a journalist working in South Asia, I have seen a lot of desperation and misery. But the screeching was so intense; it's something I will never forget. \"He alone was taking care of his parents and his family. How will they survive now?\" a villager asks. Most of the spectators are women. Most of the men from the village have gone to the Middle East to work. The few who are left behind start preparing for his cremation. Mishra, the former ambassador, says 55% of Nepali migrant workers deaths in Qatar are from \"sudden\" cardiac arrest, 20% die from work-related accidents, 15% from traffic accidents and an alarming 10% commit suicide. Nepali government records show more than 290 workers have died in the Gulf state in the past 420 days. Put another way, two Nepali workers die in Qatar every three days. These are young men dying in the prime of their life. \"The cause of deaths needs to be investigated properly, and urgently,\" Mishra says. \"In general, it is due to tension led by exploitation, adverse climate, poor working and living conditions and alcoholic intoxication.\" In Das' village, almost all the men we meet have spent time working in the Middle East. Many had recently returned from Qatar. They tell stories of hardship and of the deaths of their co-workers. Time and again, none of them seems to be convinced with investigations into their friends' and compatriots' deaths. And again, amongst the keening and wailing of his distraught family, no one is sure how Kishun Das, brought back home in a red coffin along hazardous roads, met his end in Qatar.","highlights":"A spokesman for the Qatari labor ministry details recent changes to the law .\nEach week, the bodies of dozens of migrant workers are repatriated to Nepal .\nThe body of one man, Kishun Das, is returned home as his family mourns ."}
{"article":"(CNN)I'm Candida Moss, and I am professor of New Testament and early Christianity at the University of Notre Dame. I was an adviser on the \"True Cross\" episode and served as one of the many on-camera experts in CNN's \"Finding Jesus\" series, which airs on Sundays. Viewers were invited during the show to tweet and post their questions on the \"Finding Jesus\" Facebook page. Below are some of the more interesting questions and my answers to them. They have been edited for style and clarity for this article. What's \"true\" about the cross that killed Jesus? Lynn Santos: Where might there be other pieces of the \"true cross\"? Is anyone attempting to carbon date these relics ? Moss: There are churches all over the world that claim to have fragments or splinters of the true cross. These aren't being carbon dated and there are a few reasons why. First, carbon dating is expensive, and your average church doesn't have the funds for this kind of endeavor. Second, carbon dating is seen as intrusive and a little destructive. Even if only about 10 milligrams of wood are needed, you're still chipping away at a holy object. This isn't something that churches like to do, especially as -- and this leads me to my third point -- almost all carbon dating tests end up discrediting the relics that are being tested. So, it's not in the best interest of the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches that claim to possess relics to have them tested. Matt Marino: Are you able to tell what type of wood the cross was built from? Moss: Unless we know with complete certainty that we have a fragment of the true cross, then we won't be able to assert what kind of wood was used. Nonetheless, we can make some best guesses. A number of scholars have thought that the cross was made of cedar because cedar is a sturdy wood found in the region. There is also evidence from the crucifixion of other criminals. In 1968, the remains of a crucified man named Yehohanan ben Hagkol were found during excavations in northern Jerusalem. We know he was crucified because there was a spike embedded in his ankle bone. The Department of Botany at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem concluded that the wood underneath the nail was olive wood. So perhaps that's a possibility. Daniel Pronych: How can we be certain the Romans didn't reuse Jesus' cross? Moss:  This is a great question. Hewn wood and nails were more valuable in the ancient world than they are today. There are examples of the Romans discarding tools and other implements (for instance after the battle of Masada, when they left behind pottery vessels rather than haul them away), but this usually took place in situations where carrying these tools was more effort than it was worth. The Romans were efficient and would likely have reused the instruments of torture if they could. The Jewish historian Josephus tells us that wood was scarce around Jerusalem in the first century A.D. and that the Romans had to travel 10 miles to secure timber for the siege of Jerusalem (Jewish War 5.522-23). Josephus was writing about a period of war some 40 years later but, all the same, we can imagine that the Romans wanted to conserve the wood that they had. In other words, you're absolutely right: We can't be sure the cross upon which Jesus was crucified wasn't reused in the execution of other criminals or in some other kind of construction. How well do you know the life of Jesus? Take the quiz. James Faubel: If the crucifixion of Christ was so important to Christians, why are there no images of Christ on the cross in Christian art until about the seventh century A.D.? Prior to that time, the depictions are usually of a lamb on the cross. Moss: It is certainly true that early on (first-third century) Christians did not use the image of the cross in their art. This in part seems to have been because crucifixion was so shameful and humiliating. Depicting a cross would be akin to using an image of an electric chair or a hangman's noose. So, early on, Christians used images of Daniel in the lion's den, Jonah and the whale and the three young men in the fiery furnace in the funeral art as symbols of resurrection and conquest of death. Beginning in the fourth century, things began to change. Constantine's vision was really instrumental in this process. The cross began to be retrieved as a symbol of power, so that instead of being a symbol of shameful death it became an emblem of victory over death. There are a lot of really interesting studies of the emergence of the cross in early Christian art; I'd recommend Robin Jensen's \"Understanding Early Christian Art\" as a great place to start.","highlights":"Religion professor Candida Moss appears in each episode of the program ."}

{"article":"After another meek surrender, the widespread belief that Everton are far too good to go down may have to be re-examined. Once again, Roberto Martinez's team were dramatically less than the collection of their parts and the amiable Spaniard seems unable to identify what is rotten in the core of his team. Goals in each half from Victor Moses \u2013 a long-range header no less \u2013 and Mame Biram Diouf deservedly gave Stoke City the points as Mark Hughes' side rose to eighth in the table, a remarkable 14 points ahead of their beleaguered visitors.

The on-loan Chelsea forward points to acknowledge supporters after handing his side a first-half lead . Stoke substitute\u00a0Mame Biram Diouf sealed the win with late goal after reacting to Marko Arnautovic's rebound . Everton manager Roberto Martinez looks concerned with his side collecting only one win from their last 12 games . The statistics for Everton are damning. Just one win in 12 league games, just one league clean sheet away from Goodison Park since September. Ross Barkley, their bright young hope, was kept on the bench while those who played laboured. Poor Aaron Lennon was barracked mercilessly by the Stoke fans after he snubbed them in January to join Everton and was substituted after 60 forgettable minutes. Gareth Barry picked up his 10th booking of the season, and a record 106th of his career, and will miss the next two games against Newcastle and QPR. The speed the 34-year-old moved about the Britannia, that might be a blessing for everyone. What is perplexing is the individual quality on show for Everton. Established internationals like Tim Howard, Phil Jagielka, Seamus Coleman, James McCarthy, Romelu Lukaku and others are the reason they are the sole English survivors in the Europa League.

But standing just six points above the bottom three, an almost-inconceivable double \u2013 qualification for the Champions League and relegation to the Championship \u2013 is still possible. 'It is a tough and demanding period. But there is no such thing as fear, we showed last year we have a really talented squad. We have 30 points to fight for and we are going to give our lives to get as many as we can,' said Martinez. 'We are all disappointed, the fans, the players, everyone but we are going to recover for the next challenge which we are desperate to face. Everything that could go wrong did go wrong, that is what happens when you have negative momentum. But we are not looking down, we want to get as many points as we can.'

Everton fans seemed divided at the end, some booed and some encouraged their fallen idols. They will all be glad to see Leighton Baines back from injury in time to face Newcastle in their next league game on March 15. Without him, Everton's defence looked flimsy. After 32 minutes, Phil Bardsley's cross was met with a tremendous leap by Moses, who headed over Howard from 12 yards. Why Everton's centre-halves Jagielka and John Stones backed off to give Moses a free header was unclear and they immediately held a post-goal inquest. 'We restricted them to very few opportunites afterwards,' said Stoke boss Mark Hughes. Of those that did come, Lennon shot straight at Asmir Begovic and Romelu Lukaku dragged a shot wide, a feeble finish denoting a lack of confidence. Substitute Arouna Kone had the best shot which was well parried by Begovic. If anything, Stoke looked likelier to add a second once Diouf had replaced Peter Crouch, and so it proved. A quick Stoke counter-attack saw the ball cannon off Stones in Diouf's path. He led the charge with Marko Arnautovic and when the Austrian struck the post, Diouf followed up to prod in the rebound.

They let in just 39 in the whole of last season. 'We deserved it, Victor Moses was excellent, he showed strength to the end,' said a delighted Hughes. Stoke were everything Everton weren't, fully commmited to a gameplan. They even recovered from the loss of centre-half Philipp Wollscheid who limped off early, but it was Martinez who complained about the bad luck. 'Six of our 10 games left are at Goodison Park and that is a powerful tool for us,' he said in what was effectively a rallying cry for everyone at the club. Everton finished fifth last season and were predicted to make a tip at the Champions League. Instead they are relying on clubs like Burnley and QPR being worse than they are. 'This is a really talented squad but we are in a period where things are going wrong. The first time we allowed Stoke a cross into our box, they score from it from an unlikely source. We feel there was a foul on Phil Jagielka in the build-up for the second goal at a time when we were making chances.' Martinez talks a good game. Now his team have to play one.

{"article":"(CNN)Two police officers shot and wounded while standing guard outside the Ferguson, Missouri, Police Department early Thursday were deliberately targeted in what a police official called an \"ambush.\" Such ambush-style attacks were the leading circumstance in the surging number of shooting deaths of law enforcement officers, according to the nonprofit, Washington-based National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. The shootings were a chilling low point in the protests in the St. Louis suburb since a Ferguson police officer shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown in August. The demonstrators were out again late Wednesday -- in response to the announcement hours earlier of Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson's resignation -- when shots rang out from a hill about 125 yards from where the protesters had gathered, according to witnesses. St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the shootings were an \"ambush\" intended \"for whatever nefarious reason\" to inflict harm on the officers. The officers -- one shot in the face, the other in the shoulder -- have been released from the hospital. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder decried the shootings as a \"heinous assault (that) was inexcusable and repugnant.\" Calling the shooting a \"cowardly action,\" Holder said, \"I condemn violence against any public safety officials in the strongest terms, and the Department of Justice will never accept any threats or violence directed at those who serve and protect our communities.\" The number of law enforcement officers shot to death in the line of duty rose more than 50% in 2014, the law enforcement group said in a report released in December. Many of those shootings occurred during police interactions with suspects such as traffic stops, responses to disturbances or attempted arrests. Such was the case in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Tuesday, when Deputy U.S. Marshal Josie Wells was killed in an exchange of gunfire after going to arrest a fugitive murder suspect at a motel. However, ambushes were the largest single category of circumstances in the shooting deaths of officers in 2014, according to the group's report. Fifty officers were killed by firearms -- 15 in ambush attacks -- in 2014, the Memorial Fund said. That's compared with five ambushes among 32 shooting deaths in 2013 and six ambush deaths during 2012, according to the FBI. But those ambush numbers have trended higher before in previous years: The FBI counted 15 officer deaths by ambush each year in 2011, 2010 and 2009. Ambush situations were the biggest category of circumstance behind 543 officers feloniously killed from 2002 to 2011: 23.2%. Ambush killings are nothing new. The FBI defines two types: . One is by \"entrapment and premeditation,\" which is a scenario \"where the officer was lured into danger as the result of conscious consideration and planning. These attacks are generally accomplished from cover or hiding; however, they can occur without cover or hiding,\" the agency said. The second are ambushes of \"unprovoked attacks,\" which are \"generally accomplished without hiding; however, they can occur with or without cover,\" the FBI said. Harry Houck, a consultant and former New York Police Department detective, said officers could be second-guessing themselves as scrutiny of the police increases. \"If an officer is afraid to immediately react the way he's supposed to,\" he said, \"that could cost him his life.\" According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund 2014 report, 126 federal, state, local, tribal and territorial officers died in the line of duty in 2014, compared with 102 and 123 the previous two years. Most of the on-duty deaths considered \"non-felonious\" were from traffic accidents or health reasons. CNN has not analyzed each case and cannot authenticate the group's findings. After the findings were released in December, Holder said: \"These troubling statistics underscore the very real dangers that America's brave law enforcement officers face every time they put on their uniforms. Each loss is both tragic and unacceptable -- a beloved father, mother, son or daughter who never came home to their loved ones.\" He said that the Department of Justice is doing its own analysis of officer deaths in 2014 \"so we can mitigate risks in the future.\" The report's release came amid simmering distrust and tension between police and some communities across the country. It was published less than two weeks after the December 20 ambush killing of two New York City police officers. Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, approached Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos as they sat in their marked patrol car in Brooklyn on December 20 and shot them to death. He killed himself shortly afterward. The police memorial fund invoked the memories of Liu and Ramos' deaths in a December statement. \"With the increasing number of ambush-style attacks against our officers, I am deeply concerned that a growing anti-government sentiment in America is influencing weak-minded individuals to launch violent assaults against the men and women working to enforce our laws and keep our nation safe,\" said Craig W. Floyd, chairman and CEO of the police fund. \"Enough is enough,\" he said. \"We need to tone down the rhetoric and rally in support of law enforcement and against lawlessness.\" That angry rhetoric isn't confined to the case of Ferguson -- or of Staten Island, New York, where the death of Eric Garner in July after police attempted to subdue him spurred national protests and preceded the slayings of Liu and Ramos, said Steve Groeninger, a spokesman for the memorial fund. Groeninger said the uptick in ambush-style attacks was \"punctuated\" by the New York officers' slayings, but there were other targeted attacks against law enforcement in 2014 that concern the fund. They included: . \u2022 In Las Vegas in June, Jerad Miller and his wife surprised two police officers as they ate lunch, shooting them to death. Witnesses said the Millers placed a \"Don't Tread on Me\" flag and a swastika on one officer's body. The couple then died in a murder-suicide as police closed in. \u2022 In Jersey City, New Jersey, in July, police said a man assaulted a Walgreen's security guard and took his gun in order to carry out the ambush-style killing of an officer, according to the Jersey Journal. \u2022 Two Pennsylvania State Police troopers were ambushed and shot outside police barracks in Blooming Grove in September. The hunt for the alleged killer, Eric Frein, lasted almost seven weeks. He was captured at an abandoned airport on October 30. Frein was hit with terrorism charges in November for allegedly admitting that he shot the officers to change the government and \"wake people up.\" But the number of shootings by police officers also is on the rise. According to data collected by the FBI, there were 461 justifiable homicides in 2013 -- the highest level since 1994 and the most recent year available. The figures are incomplete, however, because the shootings are self-reported and not all police departments provide them. The total number of fatal shootings by police officers is much higher -- 1,010 in 2013 and 1,134 last year, according to the nonprofit Fatal Encounters. The group started collecting the data in 2013. Its source of information is different from the FBI's. The group's founder, Brian Burghart, said the figures create a toxic environment for police, as well as suspects. \"When it comes to an eye for an eye, that people are addressing the problems with violence, the numbers are always going to go up on both sides,\" he said. This week, Wisconsin residents took to the streets to protest the police killing of Tony Robinson, a 19-year-old who was unarmed. Robinson's shooting was the fourth involving an officer in Wisconsin in the last three weeks. The others hardly made headlines: One involved an armed robbery, another a domestic abuser who put a knife to his girlfriend's throat, and another involved an assailant with a fake gun. Last April, Milwaukee police officer Christopher Manney shot Dontre Hamilton, a mentally ill man, more than a dozen times. The officer said he opened fire when Hamilton grabbed his baton and struck him with it. Manney was not charged criminally. Instead, he was fired for not following protocol. Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke accused politicians of fueling what he called an \"assault\" on policing. \"War has been declared on the American police officer,\" Clarke told CNN on Friday. \"And I'm tired of politicians taking all of the maladies of the American ghetto and blaming them on the American police officer.  ... They jumped in, early on, instead of offering calm words, they threw gas on an already smoldering fire.\" Experts say the numbers alone don't tell the whole story. \"We need to know the circumstances in each individual case,\" said Houck, the consultant and former New York Police Department detective. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","highlights":"Two police officers are shot and wounded in Ferguson, Missouri, in what a police official calls an \"ambush\"\nFirearms killed 50 officers in 2014, up from 32 in 2013, the Officers Memorial Fund says .\nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund: Of the 50, 15 were killed in ambushes ."}

A rugby team from the university School of Medicine was on a rugby tour to Amsterdam when the incident was alleged to have taken place on a ferry from Dover. P&O confirmed the team were barred from the return journey after their behaviour on the outbound trip.

Company spokesman Brian Rees said: 'It relates to a group who travelled with us from Dover to Calais in mid February. 'Unfortunately behaviour was such that we had to explain that we would not offer them the return journey so they made other arrangements to get back. 'The behaviour was so appalling we didn't have a moment's hesitation in banning them from coming back with us.' A Cardiff University spokesperson said the university had been made aware of an incident involving Cardiff Medics Rugby Team. However, no formal complaints have been made to the university. Cardiff University have confirmed they are investigating the incident after allegations of bad behaviour . The spokesperson added: 'The alleged behaviour is certainly not the behaviour we expect of our students. As far as we have been able to establish we have not received a formal complaint. 'However, on receiving this information, we are investigating the exact circumstances and will need to consider what action will need to be taken.' Elliot Howells, Cardiff Students' Union President, said: 'We are aware of an incident involving the Medics Rugby Team and are investigating this concurrently with Cardiff University. 'Should any individuals be found to be responsible, appropriate action will be taken. This type of behaviour is not condoned by the Students' Union and we convey this message strongly to sports teams during their yearly induction sessions.'

{"article":"(CNN)George Zimmerman says he bears a grudge against President Obama, accusing him of inflaming racial tensions around the Trayvon Martin case. Zimmerman, who was acquitted of murder in 2013 over Martin's death, made the allegations against Obama in a video posted on his lawyers' website. The February 2012 killing of Martin, an unarmed black teenager, by Zimmerman, a Hispanic neighborhood watch volunteer, stirred fierce debate about race and the justice system. Zimmerman, who is now 31, said he shot Martin in self-defense during a confrontation in Sanford, Florida. But critics allege the death was spurred by racial profiling. In the new video, Zimmerman claims it was Obama who stoked racial tensions surrounding the case. He cites the President's remarks in March 2012, when the case was still being investigated, in which Obama said, \"If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon.\" \"To me, that was clearly a dereliction of duty, pitting Americans against each other solely based on race,\" Zimmerman says in the conversation with his lawyer Howard Iken, who does not appear on camera. Zimmerman notes that Obama's press secretary at the time, Jay Carney, had said previously that the White House would not wade into the case, calling it \"a local law-enforcement matter.\" Asked if he felt there was one government agency or official who brought the most unfairness to his situation, Zimmerman is quick to respond. \"By far, the President of the United States, Barack Hussein Obama,\" he says. Zimmerman's comments are the first since the U.S. Justice Department announced last month that it wouldn't bring any civil rights charges against him. He says that he feels that \"the Department of Justice process worked,\" but also that it should have investigated whether his civil rights were violated. \"They had various numerous examples of bounties place on my head, credible threats placed against myself and my family,\" he says, adding that \"the President and the Attorney General and the federal government declined to do anything about it.\" Zimmerman says he has a clear conscience over Martin's death. \"Only in a true life or death scenario can you have mental clearness to know that you cannot feel guilty for surviving,\" he says.","highlights":"Zimmerman criticizes Obama's comments during the Trayvon Martin case .\n\"To me, that was clearly a dereliction of duty,\" he says ."}
{"article":"(CNN)As a well-traveled photographer, Pieter ten Hoopen is no stranger to refugee camps. But he never experienced any like the Mayo camp, which is outside the Sudanese capital of Khartoum. Ten Hoopen was at the camp to photograph a new medical clinic for Emergency, a humanitarian group from Italy. He also hoped to document what life was like for refugees there. His hopes were dashed, however, when he was told he couldn't photograph outside the hospital compound. \"I had very, very hard restrictions from the Sudanese government. ... They are very well-skilled in keeping the media at bay,\" ten Hoopen said. With no freedom of movement, much like the refugees themselves, ten Hoopen resorted to an old trick he had used before while traveling in Africa. With the help of refugee hospital workers, he built a makeshift photo studio using hospital bed sheets and other materials available. The studio quickly became a sensation. Once hospital employees volunteered to have their photo taken, lines of refugees began snaking around the hospital grounds waiting to have their portraits taken. One by one, these people sat solemnly to be photographed. It was their time to be acknowledged. There was gravity, earnestness to the way they posed. This was the moment their story would be registered. \"This was one of the reasons why I built the studio: to get more material and more narratives from the people,\" ten Hoopen said. The project quickly became a catalog of the history and identity of the refugees. The photos span several generations -- some of the subjects were born at the refugee camp, some have been there for decades. Women wearing the traditional Sudanese tobe spell out their class and origin by the way it is wrapped. From the Muslim north, women are fully covered -- a contrast to women from the Christian south, who we also see represented in these photos. Whether from Sudan, South Sudan or Eritrea, the faces become, individually and collectively, a portrait of the endless wars that have shaped the Horn of Africa. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. The word refugee often conjures up images of faceless crowds fleeing conflict, their existence only registered in terms of statistics and graphs. Ten Hoopen wanted to give his subjects the ability to express themselves freely. \"They got very serious, they sat down upright. ... I tried to say as little as possible,\" he said. \"I do believe in their own expressions, their own narrative ... and their unique perspective.\" The studio had a comforting effect. It was a haven from the hustling and bustling of the camp hospital. It gave the photographer an opportunity to meet his subject matter eye to eye, giving each person their deserved attention. Aesthetically, it created an aura around each person, beaming light on his or her personal narrative. It had some uplifting effects as well. \"I always try to put some extra thought to (projects). So I build classic photo studios like they have in any small towns in the African continent or in Europe ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way,\" ten Hoopen said. He said some patients at the hospital \"had being laying there for months in their room. ... Then you take them out, it's a little treat to get them out of their own misery. ... That's why you see the line growing, because they see people laughing when they come out of the studio.\" Ten-month-old Buseiwa was not laughing when she entered the studio. Having just had a blood test for malaria, she clearly looked uneasy. Gazing to someone who is holding her hand, her eyes connect with this parental figure as a source of strength. Hawa Haranan, 40, came from the war-torn Darfur region before getting a job as a cleaner at the hospital. As she wears a simple tobe, one can almost see the emotions behind her leonine stare. Her life and struggle, as with the other individuals photographed, is accounted for with the testimony of a camera. Ten Hoopen used tilt-shift lenses, which are normally used with the large-format cameras used in classic photography. \"I really can appreciate old portraiture ... when people got their portrait taken in a way that was loaded, I think, with respect and it was a very serious moment,\" he said. \"It's a slow way of working where you have to put all your focus into one person sitting in front of you.\" How did ten Hoopen gain the trust of so many uneasy refugees, some severely traumatized and living in fear? \"It wasn't hard,\" he said. \"I just told them to relax and have fun. \"Kids sometimes got nervous, and I don't blame them. I am a tall, white, bald European guy. ... I am not only funny to look at, but it is hot in that country so I am usually very red when I am photographing. ... I have tattoos everywhere. ... They thought I was a quite interesting creature.\" Pieter ten Hoopen is a photographer based in Stockholm, Sweden.

{"article":"The Grand Slam door was slammed in Ireland\u2019s face at the Millennium Stadium as Wales defended their patch like 15 Cardiff bouncers to secure a famous RBS 6 Nations victory. As the Welsh tackle count moved past the 250 mark, it was clear that Ireland had finally met their match. There have been questions about the entertainment value of northern hemisphere rugby but, if ever an advert was needed, this was it. Shaun Edwards punched the air in delight and the championship race lives on. Wales killed off Ireland\u2019s 10-match winning run and \u2013 describing himself as \u2018a simple Kiwi boy\u2019 in the post-match press conference \u2013 Warren Gatland proved that he is a smarter tactician than a tub of Flora. Scott Williams touches down after 62 minutes to score Wales' only try of the game to keep their Six Nations hopes alive . WIlliams makes a break for the line past Tommy Bowe before putting Wales into a commanding second-half lead . Williams goes over while Ireland players look on with dejection as they see their grip at the top the Six Nations weakened by defeat in Wales . Bowe puts his hand to his face in anguish after Williams' try as Wales held on to dash Ireland's hopes of winning the Grand Slam . Wales XV: Halfpenny, North, Davies, Roberts, Williams, Biggar,Webb; Jenkins, Baldwin, Lee, Charteris, Wyn Jones, Lydiate, Warburton (captain), Faletau . Tries:\u00a0Williams . Penalties:\u00a0Halfpenny (5) Drop goal: Biggar . Ireland XV: Kearney, Bowe, Payne, Henshaw, Zebo, Sexton, Murray; McGrath, Best, Ross, Toner, O'Connell, O'Mahony, O'Brien, Heaslip. Replacements: Cronin, Healy, Moore, Henderson, Murphy, Reddan, Madigan, Jones . Tries:\u00a0Penalty . Conversions:\u00a0Sexton . Penalties: Sexton (3) \u2018A lot of our players ran themselves into the ground,\u2019 said Gatland. \u2018In terms of atmosphere and intensity, it had everything as a Test match. Sometimes you suffer a loss and the next three or four days are a struggle to get out of bed; we were definitely on it emotionally.\u2019 That emotion was beamed through the exquisite kicking game of full-back Leigh Halfpenny. Ireland\u2019s Jonathan Sexton was dubbed as the player with gold-plated feet, but the celebrated No 10 did not quite live up to his billing. The visitors were shot down in \u2018the battle of the skies\u2019 and were forced to dessert their aerial game that was so effective against England. In the early exchanges, Rob Kearney fumbled a short kick-off and Gethin Jenkins won a fine turnover. Sexton kicked a restart straight into touch and Wales were able to build up phases. All the momentum was with the hosts and, after 13 minutes, they were 12-0 up. Welsh forwards coach Robin McBryde has told supporters not to expect a feast of flowing rugby but - despite tickets exchanging hands for \u00a3300-a-pair on the blackmarket before kick-off \u2013 they were more than happy with what they were seeing. \u2018There are a few \u201cwhat ifs\u201d and \u201cmaybes\u201d,\u2019 said Ireland coach Joe Schmidt. \u2018You look at the small margins that might potentially have changed the result. Our strategy was the same as the last few weeks but it\u2019s not a case of back to the drawing board. We won\u2019t throw the baby out of the bath water because it\u2019s pretty hard to start all over again.\u2019 Wales were building nicely but their progress was stalled by an injury to Samson Lee in the front-row. Gatland breathed a sigh of relief as Sexton pushed his first penalty wide of the left post, but the No 10 made amends with his second effort following a cheap high tackle by Scott Baldwin. The tables were there to be turned and Ireland identified Lee\u2019s replacement, Aaron Jarvis, as a weakness at the set-piece. They immediately used their choke tackle to set up a scrum, but Sam Warburton stole a dangerous attacking line-out from Devin Toner\u2019s 6ft 11 grasp shortly after.

It was a carbon-copy of Toner\u2019s pivotal steal against England two weeks ago, however the hard work was undone when the Welsh skipper was sent to the sin-bin after half an hour. Sexton continued to edge his side back with two more penalties \u2013 sandwiching a fine drop goal by Dan Biggar \u2013 but Wales survived the yellow card with their half-time lead still intact. Gatland was forced into more front-row changes at half-time when he lost Jenkins to a hamstring injury. Ireland needed to change their approach after the break and they enjoyed more possession and territory. Schmidt\u2019s players were consistently penalised for not rolling away in the first half and their discipline improved in the second. They enjoyed more improved territory and possession, but lack the execution in the final third. They camped themselves deep in Welsh territory in the 50th minute but were repelled by a cacophony of noise and fierce tackles. Inspired by the roars, Warburton rallied his players, locked the gates and forced Ireland backwards. In a breath-taking seven minutes, the Welsh defence saw off two full-blooded attacks \u2013 combining almost 50 phases \u2013 and eventually won the penalty when Sexton went off his feet at the breakdown.

Prop forward Lee leaves the field on a stretcher with what looks like a serious leg injury . It was a masterclass at snuffing out attacks - Luke Charteris made a remarkable 37 tackles throughout the game - and proved to be a flashpoint in the Welsh charge. Play moved downfield and Wales built up phases of their own. The forwards carried powerfully - providing the backs with quick, front-foot ball - and two quick passes found replacement centre Scott Williams. The 24-year-old, who had replaced Jamie Roberts because of a dead arm, short-changed Tommy Bowe after 62 minutes and cut through the defence to slide over for the first try of the game. \u2018The attitude in defence was second to none,\u2019 said Warburton. \u2018Shaun\u2019s gone into a lot of detail all week about certain policies to cover their trick plays in attack. The boys took on all that information and the detail paid off. Certain matches you can tell the boys are extremely focussed, and at breakfast I could see that everyone was so desperate to win.\u2019 Wales were on the brink of their third home victory over Ireland in 33 years, although Ireland were not finished. On the afternoon of his 100th Test, Paul O\u2019Connell turned down a near-certain three points and ordered his fly-half to kick for the corner. Peter O\u2019Mahony claimed the line-out and Wales conceded a penalty try by collapsing the maul. It set up a tense finale \u2013 with Jonathan Davies being shown a late yellow card \u2013 but Wales held on to set up another weekend of drama.","highlights":"Wales raced into an early lead as Leigh Halfpenny kicked the first points of the match from a penalty .\nFull back Halfpenny scored another three penalties for the home side as Wales led 12-0 at the Millennium Stadium .\nJohnny Sexton pulled it back to 12-6 with two penalties before Dan Biggar scored a drop goal to make it 15-6 .\nSexton added another three points with a penalty as the sides went in at half time without a try on the board .\nIreland pressed for a try early in the second half but the Wales defence held firm as they\u00a0approached\u00a0the try line .\nScott Williams gave Wales a commanding lead with the opening try in the 62nd minute to make 20-9 .\nIreland were awarded a penalty try with just over 10 minutes to play which was converted to make 20-16 .\nHalfpenny made it 23-16 with five minutes to play after scoring his fifth penalty of the match ."}
{"article":"Beijing (CNN)In China, you can often tell what the Communist Party is thinking by watching TV. For years, the typical on-screen Chinese family looked something like this:  Glowing parents doting over one precious child. The taglines drummed it home: \"One hope.\" \"One joy.\" \"One responsibility.\" Lately, the perfect television family has changed. In a recent commercial, a boy begrudgingly shares a toy with his younger sister, then they all gather together with a large brood to watch the televised Lunar New Year Gala. The message appears to be: Two is better than one. The change is extraordinary. Since the early 1980s, the Party has enforced a draconian one-child policy on most Chinese to curb population growth. When the propaganda didn't work, local officials have resorted to abortions, heavy fines, and forced sterilization. It's perhaps the most hated policy in China. Now, under relaxed restrictions announced just over a year ago, couples like Yang Xue and Chang Zi'an, both professionals working in Beijing, are eligible for a second child to join their baby girl -- 11-month-old Tao Zi, or Little Peach. Chang was an only child but sometimes wished for a sibling while growing up. \"Once my cousin visited and we shared a bed for several nights,\" says Chang, now an engineer. \"I enjoyed that feeling. I wished I had a brother who could share a bed with me every night.\" Chang and his young family live in Tongzhou, on the eastern outskirts of Beijing, where high rise apartments compete with mega malls. Some call the area \"Tong-afornia,\" because its sprawl of young professionals is a bit like parts of the Golden State. They are ideal candidates, it would seem, to have a second child. The Party is in a race against the clock. China faces a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce. The government says the country could become home to the most elderly population on the planet in just 15 years, with more than 400 million over the age of 60. Researchers say healthcare and social services will all be burdened by the greying population, and the world's second largest economy will struggle to maintain its growth. \"China has already begun to feel an unfolding crisis in terms of its population change,\" says Wang Feng, a professor at Fudan University and a leading demographic expert on China. \"History will look back to see the one-child policy as one of the most glaring policy mistakes that China has made in its modern history.\" Perhaps surprisingly, Wang says that the one-child policy was both ineffective and unnecessary, since China's fertility rates were already slowing by the 1980s. The Chinese government still maintains that it was necessary to keep numbers down. But with around 150 million one-child families and a shrinking population, the Chinese government is moving cautiously, rather than doing away with the policy altogether. In January 2014, China said it would allow couples to have a second baby if the mother or father was an only child themselves. But, to the surprise of many, the new rules haven't yet sparked a baby boom. Nationwide, nearly one million couples have applied to have a second child, state media reported in January. Health officials had said that the policy would lead to as many as two million new births when the policy change was first announced. Yang and Chang both have good jobs, but rent in Tongzhou is sky-high. And they want to send little Tao Zi to a private bilingual English and Chinese pre-school to help her in the ultra-competitive Chinese education system. Even if they were richer, they say they wouldn't want a second child. \"Money is only part of the problem,\" says Yang. \"Your energy and your time is also important. We both have to work. It is hard enough to raise her as a success. It will be miserable if we had to go through that again.\" As for his cousin's sleepovers, Chang wants to clarify. \"It was great having him over, but I was also happy when he went home.\" CNN's Shen Lu contributed to this report .","highlights":"China's controversial one-child policy was recently relaxed .\nHowever, there's been no big rush for a second child .\nMany couples say the financial cost is too great ."}

Blues fans and perhaps even Roberto Martinez may have been happy to avoid giants such as Roma and Inter Milan, but face a Ukranian side who are unbeaten in their domestic league. The Premier League strugglers may be the last British team left in Europe after next week's Champions League fixtures. So, do we know enough about their opponents? Everton manager Roberto Martinez faces a tough challenge when Dynamo Kiev visit Goodison Park . Star players . Andriy Yarmolenko . Kiev's captain had a three-game ban reduced after an appeal so he can play in Thursday night's game, and his presence could be crucial for the visitors. A creative winger, Yarmolenko loves cutting in from the right-hand side onto his favoured left foot and has impressed for Ukraine against England over the years. Martinez said: 'It is a blow from our point of view because Yarmolenko is one of their best performers.' Andriy Yarmolenko (left) has had his ban reduced and will be aiming to fire the Ukrainian side to victory . Aleksandar Dragovic . Linked with Arsenal and Tottenham, the defender is seen as a rising prospect of the game but is already a key player for Kiev. Their manager Sergei Rebrov confirmed as much.

Aleksandar Dragovic (right) is seen as a rising prospect in world football as a defender . Miguel Veloso . A mainstay in a talented Portugal team, it was somewhat of a surprise when this central midfielder opted for a move to Ukraine when leaving Genoa last year. Veloso has played at Goodison Park before, and will be hoping to prove his 52 international class convert to class on the field, too. Miguel Veloso has been capped 52 times by Portugal and is a classy player in midfield . The manager . Sergei Rebrov should know all about Everton having played in the Premier League for five years with West Ham and most notably Tottenham. The striker cost Spurs around \u00a311million in 2000 but only scored 10 goals in 60 games... he will be hoping for better luck on English soil on this occasion. The 40-year-old won the Ukranian Cup early on, and now looks to be on his way to more success this season. He said in his pre-match conference: 'Any success for Dynamo is success for the whole of Ukraine. I hope people from outside can see that life is continuing here.' Former Tottenham flop Sergei Rebrov has impressed in his first stint as manager with Kiev . Form . Thirteen wins from 16 games helping them establish a seven-point advantage over Shakhtar Donetsk in the league is one thing, but Kiev have brought that style to the Europa League, too.

A spokesman for the family confirmed Tahmooressi's release, saying his client, \"is very appreciative of the professionalism of the involved Sheriff's Department during the course of his custody.\" Jonathan Franks said Tahmooressi \"continues to struggle with PTSD\" and that this incident must be seen in that context. Tahmooressi made news around the world after his arrest on March 31, 2014, at a Tijuana, Mexico, checkpoint. Mexican customs agents found three firearms in his truck, including a .45-caliber pistol, a pump shotgun and an AR-15 rifle. The country's strict federal gun laws prohibit anyone from illegally bringing weapons into the country. Tahmooressi maintained that he took a wrong turn on the California side of the border into Tijuana and accidentally crossed the border. In November, after 214 days, he was freed. A Mexican court said it found no cause to prosecute Tahmooressi on charges of carrying two firearms used exclusively by the military, possessing cartridges used exclusively by the military and carrying a firearm without a license . The court also recommended he be treated for post-traumatic stress disorder. Tahmooressi was held overnight in Twin City, about 180 miles southeast of Atlanta.

{"article":"(CNN)French striker Bafetimbi Gomis, who has a history of fainting, said he is now \"feeling well\" after collapsing during Swansea's 3-2 loss at Tottenham in the Premier League on Wednesday. The worrying incident occurred in the first half at White Hart Lane -- after Tottenham scored in the seventh minute -- but the 29-year-old left the pitch conscious following about five minutes of treatment. The Guardian added that he was wearing an oxygen mask. Play was temporarily stopped before resuming. As the match progressed, Swansea tweeted that Gomis was \"fine,\" with manager Garry Monk using the same word to describe Gomis' condition. Gomis spent the night in hospital as a precaution, Swansea said on its website. \"I wanted to reassure you concerning my health,\" Gomis told the website. \"It actually looks much scarier than it is physically dangerous, and I am feeling well now. \"I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father's health, which requires me to go back and forth from France. \"I was disappointed that I couldn't help my team tonight, but now everything is back in order. I also want to thank everyone for their support and get well messages.\" Gomis had similar fainting spells in France, which prompted the president of his former club, Jean-Michel Aulas of Lyon, to tell French television in 2009: \"We can't not be worried, it scares you each time.\" Swansea ran tests on Gomis, said Monk, prior to signing him on a free transfer last July. \"He just has a little bit of low blood pressure which causes you a little bit of problems,\" Monk said in a televised interview on Sky. \"It's been part of his life. We were well aware of that when we signed him. He's done all the hospital checks and all the medical checks you can possibly do and it's just part of his life. \"It's no problems whatsoever.

United\u2019s indifferent league form and FA Cup exit against Arsenal on Monday have led to doubts on whether the current squad are buying into van Gaal\u2019s \u2018philosophy\u2019. However, the Dutchman has robustly defended his record. Louis van Gaal is targeting second place in the Barclays Premier League with a late push in the run-in . The Manchester United manager believes catching local rivals Manchester City is an achievable target . City are just five points ahead of United in the Premier League table, with Arsenal four behind City . \u2018We lost the first match against Swansea and had a bad start but in spite of the bad start we are a stable club in the top four,\u2019 said Van Gaal. \u2018When you are so long there after such a bad start, I think we\u2019ve done rather well.

The financial implications of missing out would be devastating but Van Gaal insists that is not his concern. \u2018I don\u2019t think that I\u2019m here to think about the financial consequences, that is (for) Ed Woodward,\u2019 he argued. \u2018I\u2019m here to manage the professional football department.\u2019 Manchester United have attracted unwelcome publicity all season.

Sergio Aguero and Co haven't been up to their usual standards at the Etihad and that could help United . Last weekend, defender Jonny Evans was banned for six matches for spitting at Newcastle\u2019s Papiss Cisse.

Ryan Giggs and Van Gaal haven't had the greatest season but are still well in with a chance of a top four spot .

{"article":"London (CNN)A photo of a weasel hitching a surprise lift on the back of a flying woodpecker near London has gone viral on Twitter, with more than 7,000 users retweeting the original post of the image. It was first posted by photographer Jason Ward on Monday and credited to Martin Le-May. After #WeaselPecker gained momentum, British media soon picked up the story, and television channel ITV interviewed Le-May. The amateur photographer from Essex, near London, told the broadcaster he had been walking with his wife in Hornchurch Country Park, Essex, when they heard \"a distressed squawking\" noise and spotted the woodpecker. \"Just after I switched from my binoculars to my camera the bird flew across us and slightly in our direction; suddenly it was obvious it had a small mammal on its back and this was a struggle for life,\" Le-May said. Eventually, Le-May told ITV, the weasel -- known as a \"least weasel\" in some countries -- lost its grip and the bird flew away. Marina Pacheco, chief executive of Britain's Mammal Society told CNN the image looked genuine and that it was possible an omnivorous weasel would take on a woodpecker. \"Weasels will go for anything that looks like food -- they've got a high metabolism and they've got to eat a lot,\" she said. \"It doesn't surprise me that a weasel took a punt -- I've seen a photo of a weasel charging a group of sparrows, they're very hungry animals.\" But she said the weasel, which would generally try to break the neck of its prey to subdue it, may have exceeded its abilities in this case. \"I think it was a bit of a long shot -- it looks like it tried to grab the neck of the woodpecker to break it,\" Pacheco said. \"I think that it probably doesn't have a big enough jaw to bite through the spine of the woodpecker.\" Weasels would not normally target green woodpeckers, Pacheco said -- their predators are normally the size of a stoat or larger. But the birds are known to spend a fair amount of time on the ground pulling up worms and hunting insects. \"If the woodpecker had managed to hit the weasel with its beak it would have been the end of the weasel,\" she said. \"They're quite gung-ho little creatures.\" The pluckiness of the weasel spawned a number of parodies on Twitter, with manipulated images showing the creature in turn being ridden by Russian President Vladimir Putin, popstar Miley Cyrus, football star John Terry -- and even what appears to be a dog red panda dressed in a Darth Vader costume. (Update: Twitter has now educated us on the difference between a dog and a red panda. Sorry, Darth!) As for the bird? The green woodpecker is also known as a \"yaffle\" for its laughing call. After the shock of being targeted by a hungry weasel wears off, we can only hope it lives up to its nickname.","highlights":"A photo of a green woodpecker flying with a weasel on its back has gone viral on Twitter .\nThe image was snapped by amateur photographer Martin Le-May near London .\nIt sparked the hashtag #weaselpecker and has spawned numerous memes ."}

Usually the Kardashian-industrial complex is dominated by comments and social media postings from Kim, followed closely by Khloe and perhaps one of the Jenner children. But on Sunday, it was Rob, the youngest of the four Kardashian siblings, who drew most of the attention. In an Instagram post, Rob Kardashian compared his sister to the sociopathic Amy Dunne, the murderous wife played by Rosamund Pike in \"Gone Girl.\" \"My sister kim, the b**** from Gone Girl,,,\" he posted. He accompanied the text with a photo of Pike's character drenched in blood, fresh from (spoiler alert!) killing her ex-boyfriend. He also unfollowed his entire family, though he changed his mind later. It's not the first time Rob has been at odds with the heavily spotlighted Kardashian clan. He missed out on Kim's wedding to Kanye West, with various (unnamed, of course) gossip sources reporting at the time that he wasn't getting along with members of his family. Khloe Kardashian, who has stayed close to Rob, told Wonderwall.com that he may have a \"kind of social anxiety.\" \"I just feel, especially over the last year, Rob has become very introverted and has a kind of social anxiety,\" she said. \"He's definitely not at his happiest place that he once was, and I know he can get to that happy place and he will.\"","highlights":"Rob Kardashian posts a pic from \"Gone Girl\" on Instagram .\nHe compares the lead character to his sister Kim .\nRob Kardashian has had an uneven relationship with family members ."}
{"article":"(CNN)I was in Florida last year when I got a call asking me to pose for a calendar. What? A calendar? As in Sports Illustrated swimsuit? Victoria's Secret angels? Cover girls. Pinups. Movie stars. Glam. I agreed, and now I am Ms. December. But it isn't quite what you think. The caller on the other end that day was Patti Tripathi. She was an anchor at CNN Headline News at a time when there were few Indian-American women in high-profile media jobs. Tripathi has her own media company now, but more recently she launched a nonprofit called Saris to Suits. She was asking me to help. She began by telling me her story. She was 12 when her family immigrated to the United States. Indian parents often have to save  a lot of money to ensure a good marriage for their daughter. Tripathi said that was a big reason why her family left. We spoke about similar experiences as Indian teenagers in America. She was not allowed to go to the prom or wear shorts, except to play tennis. She had an 8 p.m. curfew and her father expected she would be married soon after college. Tripathi felt like a burden. She did everything she could to stand on her own. And she did. My father was not as stern but he had a hard time watching his little girl become \"Americanized.\" I, too, longed to be independent, far more so than was expected of a Bengali girl in the 1970s. At an all-girls convent school in Kolkata, I used to climb up three flights of stairs to reach my classroom. On every landing were oversized portraits of national leaders, most of them Indian. Hundreds of girls in white uniforms made the stampede-like dash up the stairwell. It was impossible to stop but I always looked up when I arrived at Indira Gandhi. There she was, in her trademark white sari and what I thought was a Cruella de Vil slice in her hair. In a nation that valued boys more than girls, I was in awe that we had a female prime minister. Gandhi's political career turned out to be less than stellar, but it was 1971 and I was not yet 9 years old. I wanted to grow up to be just like her. Regal. Smart. And most of all, in control of my destiny. I know so many other Indian girls felt the same. We had dreams. Big dreams. We wanted to be someone, do something rewarding with our lives. Yet for so many girls in India, dreams are vanquished by nightmare life scenarios. They are denied education and married off within months of their first period. I have met women who were abducted and forced into prostitution or lived with physically and mentally abusive men. Those problems are not limited to India or the rest of South Asia. They exist in the immigrant communities in the United States, in which abuse and crimes are underreported because of the stigma that still exists. Women are often ashamed to talk about these things. As an Indian-American journalist, I have told stories with hopes of casting light on the world inhabited by many South Asian women. I have mentored girls in my hometown of Kolkata. And always wondered: What else can I do? Some of that desire stems from my own circumstances in life. As a newborn, I was left on the steps of an orphanage in north Kolkata. It happened to be run by an American missionary, Helen Benedict, who happened to meet my adoptive mother at the Indo-American Society. My mother was honing her English speaking skills there. That was in 1962 and my parents were childless after 10 years of marriage. It's not hard to guess the rest of the story. Instead of growing up in harsh surroundings, I was raised in a professor's house. And, instead of a future that might have been filled with darkness, I faced one that was bright. I had loving parents, attended good schools and traveled around the world. There is not a day that goes by when I don't think about the life I might have led had it not been for that fateful meeting between an American missionary and a Bengali woman pining to become a mother. I shared my story with Tripathi and told her I would help. Tripathi put together Saris to Suits as an empowerment tool. She wanted to raise money to help South Asian women. She also wanted to inspire them, she said. They needed strong role models. They needed to know that they could break out of the molds that were cast for them. She was putting together the 2015 Saris to Suits calendar and wanted to feature South Asian women who had found success in America. They were doctors, lawyers, corporate leaders. One was a weightlifter from Pakistan who struggled with balancing her sport and her Muslim attire. Another was Miss America 2014. I felt honored to be in such fine company. I would be the only journalist in the calendar. It would most certainly be my only chance in life to pretend I was a glamour girl. Some of the women opted to wear saris, the traditional dress of India. Some wore salwar kameez, a long tunic and pants. And some of us were in suits or our work attire. The 2014 calendar, the first one Tripathi published, raised money for various organizations that help South Asian women. One of them was Raksha (which means protection). Based in Atlanta, Raksha provides support for the South Asian community in a number of ways. Most of its clients are women who are dealing with abusive marriages, divorce and issues with their children. Raksha's executive director, Aparna Bhattacharyya, told me why the calendar was important. \"I think it is a reminder that there are women overcoming obstacles and that they have the potential to achieve their own goals for themselves,\" she said. \"I think it is powerful for young South Asian women to see role models that look like themselves -- role models who are making change and following their dreams.\" Her words took me back to my school in Kolkata where I gazed upward at Indira Gandhi's face. In it, I found strength. I am of course, a far cry from the likes of Gandhi, but perhaps I can inspire a teenager out there to be the architect of her future. Maybe a young woman in a sari will be able to put on a suit for the first time in her life. Besides, it's kind of cool to be in a calendar.","highlights":"CNN's Moni Basu shares her story of struggle and success as a South Asian woman .\nBasu was featured as part of the Saris for Suits calendar, a tool created to empower women .\nThe Saris for Suits campaign aims to create awareness about violence against women in immigrant communities ."}
{"article":"In a sport increasingly dominated by statistical analysis and calm dissection of performances it was reassuring to hear Dan Cole discuss the depth of anger felt by England\u2019s players on reviewing their Ireland no-show. Cole, one of the few England stars to depart Dublin with his reputation enhanced last Sunday, revealed the extent of the frustration within the England squad at their misfiring display when their Grand Slam dream was broken by a series of tactical and technical blunders. Stuart Lancaster\u2019s men held a debrief on Tuesday at their five-star Pennyhill Park retreat in Surrey and the video analysis made for uncomfortable viewing. Dan Cole has revealed the frustration felt by England's squad as they relived the Ireland defeat . Chief among their concerns was the spectacular first-half line-out fail which saw England hooker Dylan Hartley throw straight to 6ft 10in Ireland lock Devin Toner at the back when a clean catch and drive would have almost certainly yielded points. England\u2019s repeated disciplinary infringements also led to a 13 to eight penalty deficit and Cole admits watching the match again was deeply frustrating. \u2018There is room for emotion because you are frustrated with the game and there were a few things we\u2019ve gone over,\u2019 he said. \u2018We didn\u2019t plan to do a lot of the stuff that we did. Trust me we didn\u2019t train what we did at the weekend. We didn\u2019t do that on the training field. \u2018There is that frustration and it comes out in anger or whatever from coaches and players because they are frustrated in that regard. It is not just a cool, calm dissection \u2013 sometimes it is but if a point needs to be raised it is talked about. England failed to take their chances and made some basic errors, before being punished by the Irish . \u2018It was interesting, it was good, it was honest. I think there were some areas \u2013 a lot of areas obviously \u2013 where we didn\u2019t perform like we should have done.\u2019 Ireland outmanoeuvred England by denying them scrummaging opportunities and by failing to implement the expected \u2018choke tackle\u2019, therefore denying the visitors the chance to play to their strengths. Their British Lion half-back pair of Johnny Sexton and Conor Murray controlled field position with some outstanding tactical kicking. When England did have a chance to gain a foothold in the game, Hartley\u2019s wayward throw to Toner cost them dear after George Ford opted to kick a kickable penalty to the corner. Cole was one of the few Englishmen to come out of the defeat in Dublin with any credit . \u2018That line-out was a frustration. In international rugby if you get a set piece in the opposition 22 and especially 5m out you have to take it,\u2019 Cole added. \u2018You don\u2019t really get another chance like that against sides like Ireland, and we didn\u2019t really get one. I\u2019m not saying that the game changed on that but it was an emotional swing. 'They steal the ball and the crowd lifts up. You score there and it is a different mentality. It wasn\u2019t the reason we lost the game but next time we\u2019ll probably throw away from the 6ft 10 bloke with long arms!\u2019 The England prop will hope his side can bounce back against Scotland at Twickenham next week . While South African referee Craig Joubert took exception to much of England\u2019s work at the break down, Lancaster and his team hope Frenchman Romain Poite will be more forgiving at Twickenham against unfancied Scotland next Saturday. Cole added: \u2018Referees have their strengths and weaknesses, just like players do. Set-piece, open play, some refs will let you play stuff, others won\u2019t. There is a variance but it is a case of being as clean as you can. If you are positive in your actions, you will be on the right side of the referee.\u2019","highlights":"England lost to Ireland 19-9 last week in Dublin .\nDan Cole reveals the frustration after players watched video back .\nGame went against England's plans as mistakes let them down .\nEngland will hope to respond against Scotland next week at Twickenham ."}
{"article":"He is notorious for remaining tight-lipped about his personal life in interviews. And last night Davis Cup team-mate Dominic Inglot must have hoped Andy Murray would extend the same privacy to his fellow players. Asked by Eurosport presenter Annabel Croft how the team would celebrate following victory over the United States, Murray was quick to point out that his 29-year-old team-mate has a \u2018little girlfriend on the go here in Glasgow\u2019. Quiet Andy! Murray, far left, with Anabel Croft, his brother Jamie, centre, and a mortifies Dominic Inglot . Tweet:\u00a0Dominic Inglot appeared eager to set the record straight on Twitter following Murray's joke . Unfortunately for Inglot, he already has a girlfriend of six months at home in London. When asked for the name of the lady in question, a mortified Inglot replied: \u2018You\u2019ve actually landed me in this. Because I actually have a girlfriend that\u2019s going to be watching this.\u2019 The jokey stitch-up left Murray in hysterics as the team sheepishly shuffled away from the disastrous interview. A source close to the team last night explained that Murray was unaware Inglot has a girlfriend in London and did not know that the joke would backfire on his team mate. But a spokesperson for the Lawn Tennis Association last night dismissed the stitch-up as \u2018pure banter\u2019. Laura Lord of the LTA said it was \u2018just a bunch of guys messing around\u2019.

{"article":"By the time AP McCoy traipsed in, ninth in the first race of his last Cheltenham Festival, the acclaim for his great friend and rival was ringing in his ears. The sound of rolling thunder from the crowd, packed 50-deep on The Lawns along the final two furlongs of the closing straight, concluded with Ruby Walsh\u2019s name being chanted. Suddenly the people\u2019s hero seemed quite incidental. It was not to get a great deal better for the man who transcends National Hunt racing, and whose farewell to its biggest meeting dominated the build-up to this event. AP McCoy rides Jezki to a disappointing fourth in the Champion Hurdle on day one of Cheltenham . In truth, McCoy has known plenty of days like this at Cheltenham before, and while he will have felt disappointment, his supporters in a record opening-day crowd of 63,000 had much to compensate them. The thought of this Festival helps sustain some people through the long winter months and, when it finally arrived, it could hardly have been more glorious. Cleeve Hill almost shimmered in the background as springtime attempted its own burst to the front. Amid the drama McCoy fought hard to try to fulfil the expectations placed upon him, perhaps more from a wider sporting public who have come to revere his sustained excellence. The cognoscenti know that there is little low hanging fruit for him at Cheltenham this year, but there are still three days left to make this a fitting valedictory appearance. The fantasy ending remains victory on Friday, either in the Gold Cup or the meeting\u2019s final race, which has been temporarily renamed in his honour. He might be a far more sanguine character than when he first started racking up the champion jockey titles, but frustration was etched into his features as he went in and out of the weighing room. McCoy had considered Jezki (above) as his best chance of a winner at Cheltenham this year . You do not become the nation\u2019s most durable sportsman without defeats continuing to sting. On Tuesday these came in the form of finishing ninth, last, fifth, fourth and pulling up in his five races. It is a strange day when American Rich Ricci, uber-wealthy banker and the pantomime villain of racehorse ownership, gets more cheers in the parade ring than someone deemed a national treasure, but this was one of them. McCoy has admitted that he is anxious about the prospect of retirement, but afternoons such as on Tuesday might serve to ease the fear. No defeat hurt more than coming fourth on Jezki in the Champion Hurdle, and the horse\u2019s trainer Jessica Harrington revealed he had been quick to take responsibility. McCoy looks dejected after the final race, the Chaps Restaurants Barbados Novices\u2019 Handicap Steeplechase . \u2018AP was blaming himself, saying he took on Faugheen at the top of the hill, and in chasing the winner it probably cost him second or third and he finished fourth,\u2019 she said. \u2018If he had ridden him to be second to Faugheen then he may well have been second.\u2019 The latter scenario was never likely to happen, especially as McCoy had identified Jezki, the defending champion from last year, as probably his best chance in 2015. He was not to add to his comparatively modest Festival tally of 30 winners, a total exceeded not just by Walsh but Barry Geraghty, too. He has tasted glory here \u2014 the Gold Cup win on Synchronised and the masterclass on Wichita Lineman in the 2009 William Hill \u2014 but it is 17 years since he was the leading jockey at this Bacchanalian jamboree. McCoy, riding Bold Henry, pulled up with two fences left in the final race of the day . McCoy, riding in his last Cheltenham Festival, did not have the day he would have hoped upon arrival . Some revellers had gone home as he set off in the last race, the exotically-named Chaps Restaurants Barbados Novices\u2019 Handicap Steeplechase, on Bold Henry. They were never in it and pulled up with two fences left. Afterwards McCoy had what looked like a lengthy inquest with the owner JP McManus before fairly sprinting back to the weighing room for the last time. He was not in the mood to discuss the afternoon\u2019s events, saying only \u2018it was all right.\u2019 Perhaps he could merely have pointed to the name of the horse who had started favourite and just come second in the final chase. For AP it had been a Thomas Crapper kind of day.","highlights":"The 2015 Cheltenham Festival got under way on Tuesday .\nAP McCoy rode in five races  but could only manage a best place fourth .\nMcCoy rode Jezki to a disappointing fourth in the Champion Hurdle .\nThis is McCoy's final Cheltenham Festival before retirement ."}
{"article":"Minneapolis (CNN)Unexpected car repairs can blow anyone's budget. But when you're struggling to make ends meet, the impact can extend well beyond your bank account. As a social worker in Minneapolis, Cathy Heying repeatedly saw how car problems could create a domino effect that endangered her clients' health, their jobs, even their homes. For years, she wished someone would do something about the problem. Then one day Heying realized, \"Oh dang, I think that somebody might be me.\" In 2008, she quit her full-time job and enrolled in automotive school. Five years later, armed with a degree in auto technology, Heying founded The Lift. Her nonprofit garage provides steeply discounted car repairs to low-income individuals. The approach is simple: Heying sells parts at cost, with no markup, and charges $15 an hour for labor; the going rate in Minneapolis is around $100 an hour. The result? Big savings for her customers. And for those who can't pay in full, she will work out payment plans. To date, Heying has provided affordable car repairs to more than 300 low-income individuals, saving them more than $170,000 and keeping them on the road to success. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for CNN Heroes 2015 . I talked with Heying about her career change and what she's learned from her work. Below is an edited version of our conversation. Kathleen Toner: One day you're a social worker, the next you're in automotive school. What was that like? Cathy Heying: Imagine a scene of a 38-year-old woman and 18-year-old boys. I want to talk about feelings and people, and they want to talk about cars. That sums it up. It was a huge culture shift and a huge knowledge shift. I had to use my brain very differently. I did not grow up working on cars. I did not have a father that wrenched on cars. It was not part of my life growing up. I taught myself a few things (like) changing oil. But for the most part, I had no skills around car maintenance. I cried all the way to school the first day 'cause I was like, \"What have I done?\" So it was terrifying and overwhelming. And at least three solid times in that first quarter, I was like, \"I'm quitting. I cannot do this.\" See more CNN Heroes . I give credit, at least in that first quarter, to one of my instructors who's now on the board of The Lift, who kept saying, \"I know that you have a good vision here, and I'm going to help you get through this.\" And when I really thought about it, going to school is nothing compared to people who are trying to raise their kids on minimum wage, who are living with a broken-down car in subzero weather. Basically, I needed to buck up. Toner: What's it like being a mechanic? Heying: It's physically hard. You find yourself in all sorts of crazy positions, digging under things. You're lifting tires. You're wrenching on things. But it is mentally challenging, and it can be really frustrating. Because you have all the pieces and for some reason, something is not working, and it's like, \"What is it?\" And to really think thoroughly and understand full systems and how those systems play together, it is, I think, way more difficult than I think the average person thinks it is. I think of being a mechanic a lot like being a doctor. People come in, they give you a list of symptoms. You try to ask a lot of questions to narrow it down until we get an accurate diagnosis. And sometimes we get it wrong, but most of the time we get it right. But it is an art and a science mixed into one. It's a very satisfying job, when you can have a car come in not starting and you send it out the door running. At the end of the day, you can feel really good because you can look back and be like, \"This is what I did today.\" Toner: You're also helping some of the mechanics on your staff. How so? Heying: Different members of our staff have struggled with poverty and crisis in their own lives. Some of them have had interactions with the criminal justice system. Two of the three techs that we have I met when they were both experiencing homelessness. And they are all trained, formal, certified technicians. And so that is another piece of the work that we do at The Lift. We take a chance on folks who other places might not be willing to take a chance on. Toner: You save your clients a lot of money. How do they react? Heying: For the most part, people are ecstatic when they get the bill. And that just makes such a huge difference in people's lives. We had a customer in here a few weeks ago who is sleeping in his car. And he had just gotten released from the hospital because he had frostbite because he didn't have heat in his car. And so it's not just about getting people to and from work or to and from school, even though that's a really important piece of it. It's really about protecting people's lives. For many people, having a car that works and that is safe holds the rest of the pieces together. And it really allows them to remain independent, to remain self-sufficient, to meet the basic needs of their lives and do it with dignity. Want to get involved?

{"article":"(CNN)Computer hacking was once the realm of curious teenagers. It's now the arena of government spies, professional thieves and soldiers of fortune. Today, it's all about the money. That's why Chinese hackers broke into Lockheed Martin and stole the blueprints to the trillion-dollar F-35 fighter jet. It's also why Russian hackers have sneaked into Western oil and gas companies for years. The stakes are higher, too. In 2010, hackers slipped a \"digital bomb\" into the Nasdaq that nearly sabotaged the stock market. In 2012, Iran ruined 30,000 computers at Saudi oil producer Aramco. And think of the immense (and yet undisclosed) damage from North Korea's cyberattack on Sony Pictures last year. Computers were destroyed, executives' embarrassing emails were exposed, and the entire movie studio was thrown into chaos. It wasn't always this way. Hacking actually has some pretty innocent and harmless beginnings. The whole concept of \"hacking\" sprouted from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology nearly 50 years ago. Computer science students there borrowed the term from a group of model train enthusiasts who \"hacked\" electric train tracks and switches in 1969 to improve performance. These new hackers were already figuring out how to alter computer software and hardware to speed it up, even as the scientists at AT&T Bell Labs were developing UNIX, one of the world's first major operating systems. Hacking became the art of figuring out unique solutions. It takes an insatiable curiosity about how things work; hackers wanted to make technology work better, or differently. They were not inherently good or bad, just clever. In that sense, the first generation of true hackers were \"phreakers,\" a bunch of American punks who toyed with the nation's telephone system. In 1971, they discovered that if you whistle at a certain high-pitched tone, 2600-hertz, you could access AT&T's long-distance switching system. They would make international phone calls, just for the fun of it, to explore how the telephone network was set up. This was low-fi stuff. The most famous phreaker, John Draper (aka \"Cap'n Crunch) earned his nickname because he realized the toy whistle given away in cereal boxes emitted just the right tone. This trained engineer took that concept to the next level by building a custom \"blue box\" to make those free calls. This surreptitious little box was such a novel idea that young engineers Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs started building and selling it themselves. These are the guys who would later go on to start Apple. Wire fraud spiked, and the FBI cracked down on phreakers and their blue boxes. The laws didn't quite fit, though. Kids were charged with making harassing phone calls and the like. But federal agents couldn't halt this phenomenon. A tech-savvy, inquisitive and slightly anti-authoritarian community had been born. The next generation came in the early 1980s, as people bought personal computers for their homes and hooked them up to the telephone network. The Web wasn't yet alive, but computers could still talk to one another. This was the golden age of hacking. These curious kids tapped into whatever computer system they could find just to explore. Some broke into computer networks at companies. Others told printers at hospitals hundreds of miles away to just spit out paper. And the first digital hangouts came into being. Hackers met on text-only bulletin board systems to talk about phreaking, share computer passwords and tips. The 1983 movie \"War Games\" depicted this very thing, only the implications were disastrous. In it, a teenager in Washington state accidentally taps into a military computer and nearly brings the world to nuclear war. It's no surprise, then, that the FBI was on high alert that year, and arrested six teenagers in Milwaukee -- who called themselves the 414s, after their area code -- when they tapped into the Los Alamos National Laboratory, a nuclear weapon research facility. Nationwide fears led the U.S. Congress to pass the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in 1986. Breaking into computer systems was now a crime of its own. The damage of hacking started getting more serious, too. In 1988, the government's ARPAnet, the earliest version of the Internet, got jammed when a Cornell University graduate student, curious about the network's size, created a self-replicating software worm that multiplied too quickly. The next year, a few German hackers working for the Russian KGB were caught breaking into the Pentagon. In 1990, hacker Kevin Poulsen rigged a Los Angeles radio station's phone system to win a Porsche, only to be arrested afterward. The cat-and-mouse game between law enforcement and hackers continued throughout the 1990s. Some hacked for money. Russian mathematician Vladimir Levin was caught stealing $10 million from Citibank. Others did it for revenge. Tim Lloyd wiped the computers at Omega Engineering in New Jersey after he was fired. But hacks were still more of an annoyance than anything devastating, though it was quickly becoming apparent that the potential was there. The stock market, hospitals, credit card transactions -- everything was running on computers now. There was a bone-chilling moment when a ragtag group of hackers calling themselves L0pht testified before Congress in 1998 and said they could shut down the Internet in 30 minutes. The danger was suddenly more real than ever. The ethos was starting to change, too. Previously, hackers broke into computers and networks because they were curious and those tools were inaccessible. The Web changed that, putting all that stuff at everyone's fingertips. Money became the driving force behind hacks, said C. Thomas, a member of L0pht who is known internationally as the hacker \"Space Rogue.\" An unpatched bug in Windows could let a hacker enter a bank, or a foreign government office. Mafias and governments were willing to pay top dollar for this entry point. A totally different kind of black market started to grow. The best proof came in 2003, when Microsoft started offering a $5 million bounty on hackers attacking Windows. \"It's no longer a quest for information and knowledge by exploring networks. It's about dollars,\" Thomas said. \"Researchers are no longer motivated to get stuff fixed. Now, they say, 'I'm going to go looking for bugs to get a paycheck - and sell this bug to a government.' \" Loosely affiliated amateurs were replaced by well-paid, trained professionals. By the mid-2000s, hacking belonged to organized crime, governments and hacktivists. First, crime: Hackers around the world wrote malicious software (malware) to hijack tens of thousands of computers, using their processing power to generate spam. They wrote banking trojans to steal website login credentials. Hacking payment systems turned out to be insanely lucrative, too. Albert Gonzalez's theft of 94 million credit cards from the company TJX in 2007 proved to be a precursor to later retailer data breaches, like Target, Home Depot and many more. Then there's government. When the United States wanted to sabotage the Iranian nuclear program in 2009, it hacked a development facility and unleashed the most dangerous computer virus the world has ever seen. Stuxnet caused the Iranian lab computers to spin centrifuges out of control. This was unprecedented: a digital strike with extreme physical consequences. Similarly, there's proof that Russia used hackers to coordinate its attack on Georgia during a five-day war in 2008, taking out key news and government websites as tanks rolled into those specific cities. Then there are hacktivists. The populist group Anonymous hacks into police departments to expose officer brutality and floods banks with garbage Internet traffic. A vigilante known as \"The Jester\" takes down Islamic jihadist websites. What exists now is a tricky world. The White House gets hacked. Was it the Russian government or Russian nationalists acting on their own? Or freelance agents paid by the government? In the digital realm, attribution is extremely difficult. Meanwhile, it's easier than ever to become a hacker. Digital weapons go for mere dollars on easily accessible black markets online. Anonymity is a few clicks away with the right software. And there are high-paying jobs in defending companies like Google or JPMorgan Chase -- or attacking them. As a result, law enforcement tolerance for hacking has fallen to zero. In 1999, the hacker Space Rogue exposed how FAO Schwarz's website was leaking consumer email addresses and forced the company to fix it. He was cheered. When Andrew Auernheimer (known as \"weev\") did the same thing to AT&T in 2010, he spent more than a year in prison until his case was overturned on a technicality. The days of mere curiosity are over.","highlights":"The concept of \"hacking\" began nearly 50 years ago at MIT .\nIn the '80s, hackers wanted to make technology work better .\nThe story of '80s teen hackers busted by the FBI is featured on cnn.com\/shortfilms ."}
{"article":"(CNN)From an iconic marble statue of a heavily pregnant disabled artist to the more recent giant blue cockerel, London's Fourth Plinth art project has always provided a controversial modern twist to the traditional landmarks around London's Trafalgar Square. The latest offering, \"Gift Horse,\" which took up residence in the Square's northwest corner Thursday, looks set to continue the tradition with a work that explores the link between power, money and history, according to organizers. Unveiled by London's Mayor Boris Johnson, the sculpture created by German-born conceptual artist Hans Haacke portrays a skeletal riderless horse with an ribbon-shaped electronic ticker tied to its left leg showing live market data from London's Stock Exchange. \"'Gift Horse' is a startlingly original comment on the relationship between art and commerce and I hope it will stimulate as much debate as other works that have appeared on the plinth,\" Johnson said. The 13-feet high bronze skeleton is a \"wry comment,\" organizers say, on the equestrian statue of King William IV originally planned, but never realized for the plinth more than 150 years ago. Further nods to the past and the sculpture's location can be found in the pose which is based on the engraving \"The Anatomy of a Horse\" by English artist George Stubbs, whose famous equine portraits hang on the walls of the National Gallery on Trafalgar Square's north side. One of London's most famous landmarks, Trafalgar Square is popular with tourists. Named after a famed 1805 British naval victory against the French, its centerpiece is a column commemorating Lord Horatio Nelson, who died during the conflict. In a career spanning half-a-century, Haacke has frequently explored the interconnectedness of art, power and money through installations, paintings, photography and written text. Many of Haacke's most famous works have explored systems, be it physical -- as evidenced by his famous 1960s work \"Condensation Cube\" -- or the social and political as seen in \"MoMA Poll\" (1970), \"A Breed Apart\" (1978) and more recently his \"Der Bev\u00f6lkerung\" (The People) installed in Germany's Reichstag building in Berlin in 2000. \"It's a very prominent spot,\" said the 78-year-old, reflecting on the \"Gift Horse's\" positioning in Trafalgar Square,  \"It's very beautiful. Everybody sees it.\" \"There are other statues and the idea of having the empty plinth which has been made available periodically for artists is a great idea,\" added Haacke. Around Trafalgar Square there was mixed reaction to the sculpture. \"It definitely doesn't look like a horse's head, does it? Looks more dinosaur-ish to me,\" said a slightly baffled female day-tripper from Wales, while another tourist seemed equally confused. \"My first impression was that it looked like an alien, because you see it and then you think, huh? What is it?\" said Toni, visiting from Switzerland. Local reaction was more positive though. \"I just think it's very witty,\" said Londoner Tony Francis. \"I can see the (George) Stubbs influence. And I love the Stock Exchange (ribbon) scrolling round and the way they merge into each other.\" \"Gift Horse\" is the 10th artwork to sit on the plinth and follows the \"Hahn\/Cock,\" created by German artist Katharina Fritsch which was in residence from July 2013 to February this year.","highlights":"A new sculpture for Trafalgar Square's Fourth Plinth unveiled Thursday .\n'Gift Horse' by German-born artist Hans Haacke will sit on plinth for 18 months .\nHaacke's is the 10th artwork to be displayed on the plinth ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Three teenagers from northwest London were released on bail Sunday after their alleged plans to travel to Syria led to their arrest. Two 17-year-olds boys and a 19-year-old man were arrested \"on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts,\" the Metropolitan Police said. The investigation started on Friday, after police learned the two 17-year-olds were missing and were believed to be traveling to Syria. They were traveling with a 19-year-old, police said. British authorities shared intelligence regarding the 17-year-olds with Turkish officials on Friday, and that night, the individuals landed in Istanbul on a flight from Barcelona, Spain, a Turkish official told CNN. The teens were stopped, along with another person who had been regarded as suspicious by Turkish intelligence working at the airport's risk analysis center, which monitors risky flights and runs checks on suspicious passengers trying to enter Turkey. Turkish authorities questioned the teens, the Turkish official said, and the Metropolitan Police said the three arrived back in London shortly before midnight Saturday and were arrested. \"When we have intelligence shared with us there is no problem. We stop them and directly deport them. And of course Turkish intelligence is always on the lookout as well,\" the Turkish official said. Turkey on Thursday arrested a person who worked for an undisclosed nation's intelligence service on suspicion of helping the girls, according to Turkey's foreign minister. On Friday, a Turkish television network aired a video purportedly showing the girls preparing to cross the Turkish border into Syria. CNN's Eliott C.

{"article":"The legends whom Lewis Hamilton would emulate met in the paddock for a brief chat \u2014 the tartan hat of Sir Jackie Stewart peak to peak with the equally trademark red cap of Niki Lauda. The decades have not dimmed a bond begotten by each man\u2019s achievement in winning the Formula One world drivers\u2019 title three times. Only seven others could ever make that claim: Fangio, Brabham, Piquet, Prost, Senna, Schumacher and Vettel. Here in sunlit Melbourne, Hamilton began practice for the Australian Grand Prix at the start of a 20-round season in which the British driver hopes to add his name to that exclusive club. Lewis Hamilton will be hoping to retain the Formula One title after last season's triumph . Hamilton took part in Friday's Formula One Grand Prix practice session ahead of Sunday's season opener . Michael Schumacher, pictured in 2006, is the most successful Formula One driver with seven world titles . The first race of the 2015 Formula One schedule begins in Melbourne, Australia on Sunday . Drivers\u2019 champion . Lewis Hamilton. A great driver in a great car. His one and only threat is Nico Rosberg, poised and calculating coolly for any mistake. Constructors\u2019 champion . Put your weekly shopping budget, your mortgage and Johnny\u2019s school fees on Mercedes. Surprise driver . Toro Rosso\u2019s Max Verstappen, 17 and 166 days tomorrow. A brilliant talent. My second choice: Daniil Kvyat of Red Bull. The race I am most looking forward to? The saying in F1 is those that start with \u2018M\u2019 are the best to be at: Melbourne (my absolute favourite), Monte Carlo, Montreal and Monza. Mexico returns this year. Hamilton pondered the word \u2018legend\u2019 and said: \u2018I hope when I have retired and am much, much older, perhaps in 30 years, a kid might use that phrase for me. \u2018I want to win this year. There\u2019s a championship there for the taking. Damn it, I want to win it! I want to go and grab it. More than ever. At least as much as last year, and hopefully even more.\u2019 He will certainly have a car capable of accomplishing that task. Mercedes are in a parallel universe of speed and reliability, according to pre-season testing. It again promises to be a straight fight between him and his team-mate Nico Rosberg. Lauda is their boss at Mercedes. Stewart has been a critic of Hamilton from time to time. He thinks the word \u2018legend\u2019 can only be applied long after a driver has hung up his helmet. \u2018That is how it works with many halls of fame in America,\u2019 he said. \u2018Time waits to confer its judgment.\u2019 The debate about Hamilton is always keen. He fuels this by his actions. He has taken to posting pictures of himself brooding and pouting, half-dressed and self-absorbed on the photo-based website Instagram. One such picture had Hamilton standing in a graffiti-lined alley in Melbourne looking up to the sky with his hands clasped in prayer. These fine exhibits of modern art are being undertaken by Dan \u2018Spinz\u2019 Forrest, a bald and bearded music producer who seems newly to have attached himself to Hamilton. He is walking around the paddock with a camera in his hand. Never mind that, it is Hamilton\u2019s heavy and skilled right foot that will define him over the next eight-and-a-half months. But his compatriot Jenson Button believes there is still room for Hamilton to improve on his championship-winning form of last season. Hamilton celebrated in Abu Dhabi after winning the 2014 Formula One Championship . Mercedes F1 team showed their support for Red Nose Day by wearing merchandise on Friday . Mercedes' drivers Hamilton (left) and Nico Rosberg both also wore T-shirts in support of Red Nose Day . \u2018He was most inconsistent last year,\u2019 said Button, whose McLaren was three seconds slower than Mercedes in practice. \u2018In racing, Lewis was stronger than ever. In qualifying, he seemed weaker than ever. It was a different Lewis. This year, with more confidence, he\u2019ll be more consistent in qualifying and a stronger driver.\u2019 Rosberg\u2019s qualities should not be enough to stop an on-form, all-firing Hamilton becoming the first Briton to win consecutive titles, but the German is calm and focused on his retaliative challenge. \u2018Lewis was a little bit stronger than me last year,\u2019 admitted Rosberg, who is due to become a father in August. \u2018He\u2019s been working on himself during the winter and I have been working on myself. \u2018I\u2019m not at my peak Formula One performance yet. Being an F1 driver is multi-faceted. It\u2019s not just about turning the steering wheel in the best possible way. It\u2019s outside the car, too, having your whole life around you sorted so you are focused and have the energy to do the perfect job in the car. Coming second has motivated me for this year.\u2019 Hamilton wants to remembered as a 'legend' after he has retired from Formula One . The 30-year-old takes time out in the garage during the first practice session of the new season . Sauber's former Dutch driver Giedo van der Garde has abandoned his legal action against the team . The season starts with Formula One in a curious, but entirely new, state of disrepair. Manor, the team that rose from the bones of Marussia, look unlikely to race because, among other things, they do not have the software required to run their cars. It seems the hard drives were wiped to prepare them to be auctioned when the team\u2019s assets were due to be sold and they now need to reinstall the missing programs. But the biggest drama was at Sauber, where Dutch driver Giedo van der Garde is suing the team for breaking his contract. A court in Melbourne has ruled in his favour, saying he should race. However, he cannot do so because he has not been granted a super-licence. He still put on overalls yesterday and was fitted for his seat, unavailingly. Sauber sat out the first practice session but took part in the second in the form of their two named drivers Marcus Ericsson and Felipe Nasr. The squabbling parties called a truce of sorts this morning Melbourne time, with Van der Garde abandoning his legal action and averting, for now at least, the threat of bailiffs seizing the team\u2019s assets. DAVID COULTHARD . \u2018Lewis appears to be going through a transition in his off-track life. I see he is negotiating his own contract, doing music in the future and has split up with Nicole (Scherzinger), and all of these things have an influence on your life which may be a positive or negative. 'It will be interesting to see now he is a wealthy champion and got lots of opportunities whether the absolute focus is still on the job. Nico now has the experience of battling for a world championship. He went into last year with a good car, everything was going great, then he had the collision in Spa, his team told him he was a bad boy and he was getting booed. I think he will be stronger.\u2019 DAMON HILL . \u2018Nico has talents that are slightly more subtle and less obvious than Lewis but I think he is going to have to invent a new Nico to counter his team-mate. The championship was delivered by Lewis, so if Mercedes have to hedge one way or the other, they will go for Lewis. 'I can\u2019t see Lewis getting distracted. He can see the prizes, he collects his trophies and is very proud of his success and he still talks as if he is stunned by his own success. He will be difficult to beat this year.\u2019 MARTIN BRUNDLE . \u2018If Lewis had finished his career with one championship it would have been a travesty but if he wins a third he becomes one of the all-time greats. 'He has got to win consecutive championships which is always perceived to be particularly difficult, but he is going to have a dominant car again so it is Nico Rosberg who he has got to race. Unless Nico has found a way to raise his game, what is going to put Lewis under pressure apart from himself?\u2019 JOHNNY HERBERT . \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a given for Lewis. He can\u2019t say \u201cI beat him last year and it\u2019s going to be fine, I will be able to do those runs of winning four races on the trot again and everything will be hunky dory\u201d \u2014 It won\u2019t be like that. Lewis will think, \u201cYes, I\u2019m quicker\u201d. Is Rosberg capable of doing it? I think he is, that\u2019s why I say Lewis cannot rest on his laurels because he will be there for sure.\u2019","highlights":"Lewis Hamilton will be hoping to win his third Formula One title .\nOnly seven other drivers have ever won more than two F1 titles .\nHamilton is gearing up for Sunday's season opener in Melbourne ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Entertainers are paid for entertaining and it's time athletes received financial recompense for taking part in the Olympics, says 100m hurdler Sally Pearson. In 2014,while the winner of Wimbledon received $2,600,000 and the Augusta Masters champion picked up $1,620,000, when Pearson won gold in the Olympics three years ago she received zero prize money. \"People come for the entertainment from the athletes -- we are entertaining them, we are entertainers\" the Australian, who set an Olympic record of 12.48 seconds in her 2012 winning run in 2012, told CNN anchor Alex Thomas. \"Entertainers get paid every single time they step up onto a stage, and that's exactly what we're doing in a sporting sense.\" Billions might have tuned in to watch London's 2012 Olympic Games which saw over 10,000 athletes compete across 302 events in a battle for golden glory, but the International Olympic Committee's current policy is to (IOC) hand out gold, silver and bronze medals as well as a bouquet of flowers to athletes, but no financial remuneration. \"I can see why they don't, and I'm sure they want to keep it like that, they want to keep it pure,\" added Pearson. \"To be honest we're all still going to turn up whether we get paid or not. But the Games wouldn't happen without the athletes.\" It also wouldn't happen without sponsors. The IOC has just signed a new eight-year sponsorship deal with car manufacturing giant Toyota -- reportedly worth just under $1 billion -- adding to their list of partners that include McDonald's and Coca-Cola. Athletes usually fund themselves through sponsorship deals, government support, grants and part-time work. In 2012 only half of American track and field athletes -- who were ranked in the top 10 in their nation -- earned more than $15,000 a year from their sport. The fifth fastest 100m hurdler in history, Pearson told the Australia's Daily Telegraph in 2013 how a year after her Olympic gold medal in London she still wasn't attracting enough sponsors. No stranger to hard work -- the hurdler sometimes vomits after intense training sessions -- she decided to chase down her own deals rather than sit on her hands waiting for private sponsorship. While she has some support from Qantas, AMP and Adidas, appearance fees and prize money in the Diamond League -- an annual series of track and field meetings -- also provides revenue earning potential for the 28-year-old. Now targeting more medal success at the  2016 Rio Olympics, Pearson achieved a resounding win at the Queensland Track Classic on March 7 with a time of 12.74s. Even so the issue of Olympic prize money still clearly grates. \"I think the times have changed from 1896 to 2016, I think it might be time to at least have a think about it, and discuss it because there's no such thing as the Olympics without athletics or athletes,\" said Pearson.","highlights":"Olympic 100m gold medal winner Sally Pearson says IOC should think about paying athletes .\nPearson won gold at the London 2012 Olympics ."}

{"article":"Open Championship venue Royal St George's has voted to allow women members for the first time in its history. A statement from the club read: 'The Royal St George's Golf Club is pleased to announce that, following an extraordinary general meeting held on 14th February 2015 and a subsequent ballot of the full members of the club, a resolution to alter the club's rules to make ladies eligible for membership has been duly passed. 'Under the club's rules, the resolution would only be passed if it obtained the support of three-quarters of the votes cast on the ballot. More than 81 per cent of the full members took part in the ballot and a decisive 90 per cent voted in favour of ladies being eligible for membership. Darren Clarke won The Open the last time it was held at Royal St George's in 2011 . 'The alteration of the club's rules has immediate effect and the club looks forward to welcoming ladies as junior and full members.' Royal St George's had been one of three clubs on the Open rota with a male-only membership policy. The club last hosted the Open in 2011 when it was won by Europe's Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke. Muirfield and Royal Troon are the other two courses to have male-only membership policies. Muirfield, which is owned and run by The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, is reviewing its membership criteria with a report due to be completed this month, while Troon announced in January its intention to undertake a 'comprehensive review' of its membership policy. Rickie Fowler hits a shot in the 2011 Open Championship amid a familiar St George's backdrop . St George's boasts a 60-foot bunker, the deepest in Britain, as a unique feature of the course . Troon has always considered itself a special case in this respect as it shares facilities with the Ladies Golf Club, Troon. And the club also confirmed in January it will share the responsibility of hosting The Open in 2016 with the Ladies' Club, with the formation of a joint Championship Committee. Royal Troon Captain, Bob Martin said: 'Royal Troon Golf Club has hosted The Open on eight occasions since 1923 and in 2016 we will share this responsibility with The Ladies' Golf Club, Troon as joint hosts of the 145th Open Championship. 'The clubs enjoy a close working relationship and we look forward to hosting a successful Open here in 2016.' The Royal & Ancient Golf Club at St Andrews ended its 260-year-old male-only membership rule in September . In a statement, Troon said it will 'undertake a comprehensive review to consider the most appropriate membership policy for the future', adding: 'The recommendations from this review will be presented to the membership for their consideration.' Scrutiny of the clubs intensified after the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews voted to end its 260-year-old male-only membership policy in September. A spokesperson for the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers later confirmed that the consultation over allowing women members at Muirfield is currently ongoing, with the findings due to be reviewed this spring.","highlights":"Royal St George's is latest Open venue to allow women members .\nGolf club in Sandwich, Kent, reveals 90 per cent voted in favour .\nThe R&A ended its 260-year male-only membership in September .\nScrutiny has also fallen on male-only policy at Muirfield and Troon ."}
{"article":"(CNN)The emotional two-hour season finale of Fox's \"Glee\" went full circle from the show's roots to the future, reminding Gleeks why they fell in love with the musical sitcom. Few would disagree that the show's first season was its best, winning over a dedicated fan base who stuck with the show through an uneven six seasons and the loss of star Cory Monteith. For its final episode Friday night, the show that made it cool to join the high school glee club focused on core characters introduced in the first season. The first hour of Friday's season finale, aptly titled \"2009,\" was a retelling of the first episode, which included a memorable performance of Journey's \"Don't Stop Believing\" by the original members of William McKinley High School's glee club. Instead of telling it again through Finn's perspective, the finale showed what led the other characters to join New Directions, culminating in an edited version of the performance that packed an emotional punch by featuring Monteith. The second hour brought us to the present day, with Will passing New Directions on to Sam so he can take charge of McKinley High as a fine arts school. We saw the characters' dreams come true in a requisite flash-forward to the future: Rachel (now married to Jesse) wins a Tony Award; Mercedes sings with Beyonce; Kurt and Blaine are successful Broadway stars; and most amazing of all, Vice President Sue Sylvester starts her second term in the Jeb Bush administration. The entirety of New Directions, past and present, gathered one last time in the auditorium, now named after Finn. They sang one last song before we saw a quote from Finn summing up the show: \"See the world not as it is, but as it should be.\" Fans approved of the final episode, sharing tributes and celebrating the show on social media.","highlights":"\"Glee\" ended Friday after six season .\nShow's two-hour finale looked at the characters' past and future .\nFans raved about the ending ."}
{"article":"The appliance of science behind Ronny Deila\u2019s Celtic reign was there for all to see on Sunday afternoon. Any lingering scepticism about his methods surely went the same way as Aberdeen\u2019s resistance. Despite playing with 10 men for much of a demanding, frustrating 90 minutes against Inter Milan three days previously \u2013 and the associated, sleep-disturbing travelling \u2013 Deila\u2019s team simply ran all over their perceived title rivals in the second half of a 4-0 victory. It was an impressive display of physical power and mental focus. The Norwegian\u2019s insistence that Celtic could be fitter caused a fair degree of controversy early in his tenure. It was interpreted \u2013 or perhaps misinterpreted \u2013 as a slight on predecessor Neil Lennon. Ronny Deila's Celtic side are starting to become formidable under the Norwegian's reign at Parkhead . But this much is clear. Deila has unquestionably made the Parkhead side more formidable in that regard. And he has all the stats to back it up. Including one which earned recent arrival Gary Mackay-Steven a rapid (in more ways than one) gold star. Crunching the numbers after matches is an important aspect of Deila\u2019s work when it comes to assessing various aspects of his players\u2019 performances. To the 39-year-old, these reams of figures produced by the technology at Celtic\u2019s disposal provide an objective view to place alongside his managerial opinion. The hope is that it leads to better decisions. Again, there would have been a few from the football old-school previously willing to raise an eyebrow at such talk. But what happened at the weekend provided a riposte to any sneers. Deila (centre) is keen on his players being the fittest and results have shown impressive statistics . \u2018I think the most important thing is that the players see and also the people around them - you and everybody - see that what we are doing is effective,\u2019 said Deila. \u2018There are always things that we can do better and we have had some bad results, but I think we have had six victories after coming home from European games. That\u2019s really good. You don\u2019t see that around the other European leagues. Inter Milan lost at the weekend and they are struggling a lot when they come back \u2014 so we did well to win in that way. \u2018The amount of metres and sprints on Sunday was unbelievable when you consider we played three days before. We have increased the high-intensity running by 30-40 percent since the summer. That is a lot. Gary Mackay-Steven (right) ran an impressive 1300 metres against Aberdeen on Sunday . \u2018We want to be direct, we want to create things, we want to have penetration, we want to be a high-pressing team, so you have to run quick and you see that in the stats and in how we perform.\u2019 Asked if he knew which of his players topped the various statistic tables, Deila broke into a grin. \u2018I know everything about the players,\u2019 he laughed. \u2018When we played Inter at home, their striker, Rodrigo Palacio, ran 1250 metres at high intensity against us, sprinting. That is an incredible number. But at the weekend Gary Mackay-Steven ran 1300m! \u2018You have to know the references of what it means to be fit. It\u2019s easy to say that to the other players, if I tell them how far Gary Mackay-Steven ran in a game and compare it to them. Deila highlighted how impressive Palacio's running was against his side in the Europa League clash . \u2018If a player asks me why he is sitting on the bench and not playing, I can show him the numbers. If he is running 600m and the guy in the team is running 1200m, what does he think of that? \u2018Why can\u2019t Gary run as far every game? Stuart Armstrong ran 900m on Sunday and he didn\u2019t play the whole game.\u2019 It was pointed out that Armstrong actually lasted only 62 minutes after replacing Kris Commons against Aberdeen, before being hurt and making way for Anthony Stokes. Was that not evidence of the midfielder being overworked? The winger also scored a terrific solo goal against their title rivals to send the Bhoys six points clear . \u2018It was cramp, he\u2019ll be okay for (tonight\u2019s game) against St Johnstone,\u2019 said the Celtic manager. \u2018It was a sign that he is not strong enough yet. You have to think of the mental and physical loading on a player. \u2018Just coming to Celtic - dealing with the contract, the media and so on - used a lot of mental energy in Gary and Stuart. \u2018Then the training is at a much higher tempo then they have been used to before. The total loading gets too much. That\u2019s why Stuart started on the bench. \u2018But then Scott Brown is doing it every day. He is so strong, unbelievably strong. Why? Because he has done this for many years, he works really hard every single day and he looks after himself. Stefan Johansen is also starting to get that into his body.\u2019 So is it a case of simply saying the best teams are the fittest teams? Scott Brown has been praised by his manager for his unbelievable strength and work ethic . \u2018No, that\u2019s not true,\u2019 countered Deila. \u2018But that\u2019s the easiest thing to do something with. I don\u2019t think the best teams are the fittest \u2013 they could be \u2013 but there are so many parameters, so many boxes you have to fill in football. \u2018We don\u2019t train more than they did before but hopefully we train better and we give more in that hour-and-a-half every day. \u2018As for the stats, we use them in different situations. It is not only stats about running but who has been involved in goal chances offensively and defensively. Instead of saying something subjectively, you can see it as a fact. Stuart Armstrong is also a willing runner for Celtic and his stats are impressive since he joined the club . \u2018But everything has to be related to football. We are not marathon runners. It is about what we do on the pitch.\u2019 What Celtic have done on Scottish pitches is win their last 10 domestic matches. Making it 11 against St Johnstone at Parkhead will push them nine points clear of Aberdeen. Complacency might be the creeping danger, but Deila doesn\u2019t detect any traces of that corrosive commodity. \u2018There is still so much to fight for,\u2019 he insisted. \u2018We are working here on the culture, every day, to be 100 per cent every day. \u2018I have no reason to be worried because I haven\u2019t once seen the players have a bad attitude or a lack of concentration. I am really looking forward to the game and I expect a good performance and hopefully a good result.\u2019","highlights":"Ronny Delia's side are formidable in the Scottish Premier League .\nCeltic's fitness levels are more than impressive and part of the reason for their incredible recent run of eight straight SPL victories .\nGary Mackay-Steven ran a\u00a0phenomenal 1300 metres against Aberdeen .\nClick here for all the latest Celtic news ."}

The gag started Friday when one ambitious seller attempted to sell a Zipperseal bag with \"Air From Kanye Show,\" with 90 bidders driving the price tag to over $60,000, the Telegraph reports. While that auction was ultimately pulled from the auction site, eBay has since been flooded with similar auctions promising air bagged from a Yeezus show, even though the copycats lacked certificates of authenticity proving the air -- likely carbon dioxide -- was grabbed at a West concert. eBay has apparently stopped trying to swat down the new \"bagged air\" auctions, so buyer beware at this point.

{"article":"(CNN)When Indiana Gov. Michael Pence signed his state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), he apparently did not anticipate the resulting uproar.  Many of Indiana's businesses fear that the law could be used to allow store owners to deny service to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons. The NCAA has expressed concern about the Final Four, which Indianapolis is hosting this weekend, and other companies have threatened to move their businesses outside of the state. But, when pushed on the issue, Pence insisted that the law is \"not about discrimination\" but instead is \"about protecting the religious liberty of every Hoosier of every faith.\"  When asked whether he would allow an amendment to clarify that the law will not preclude anti-discrimination protections, the governor doubled-down, noting that \"we're not going to change this law.\" But members of the Indiana legislature beg to differ with the governor, pledging to \"fix\" Indiana's RFRA. And now, the Governor has changed his tune, also calling for a fix to the bill. Can there really be an easy \"fix,\" short of repealing the Act? The answer is, of course, it depends. Under RFRAs like Indiana's, people are not free to disobey any law in tension with their religious convictions.  Instead, RFRAs create a standard to balance a person's religious interests against the governmental policy at stake.  Under Indiana's RFRA, the government must show that its policy interest advances a compelling state interest and is the least restrictive means to address the problem at issue. The question would then become whether anti-discrimination laws advance a compelling interest in the least restrictive means.  The answer to that question is easy: yes.  The adoption of such laws have long been viewed as advancing compelling state interests, and the only way to eliminate discrimination is to ban it, so they are the least restrictive means. At present in Indiana, there is no state-level law that protects LGBT persons from discrimination by private parties.  In certain cities and other, local jurisdictions, however, there are ordinances prohibiting such discrimination. Indiana would have two ways to \"fix\" the RFRA problem. The first would be to adopt state-wide nondiscrimination laws that protect LGBT persons.  Such an act would confirm that, as a matter of state policy, protecting the LGBT community is viewed as a compelling state interest.  This would bring Indiana into alignment with Illinois, which has a RFRA, but which also has a comprehensive nondiscrimination statute, ameliorating any concerns about the RFRA being used in discriminatory fashion. Given the wishy-washy answer that Gov. Pence provided when asked whether he thought discrimination against LGBT persons was appropriate, the likelihood of Indiana adopting a comprehensive nondiscrimination statute seems remote at best, eliminating this fix as an option. Another possibility would be to amend the statute to confirm that any federal, state, or local nondiscrimination laws constitute a compelling state interest for the purposes of the RFRA.  Importantly, federal law does not protect LGBT persons from discrimination by private actors, and neither does Indiana state law. But this language would expressly carve out local ordinances from the scope of the RFRA, such as the nondiscrimination ordinance in Indianapolis. In essence, this would preserve much of the law as it existed before the RFRA: absent local nondiscrimination laws, persons are free in Indiana to discriminate against LGBT persons on any basis. This amendment, however, would make clear that the state-level RFRA cannot be used to trump local city ordinances that protect the LGBT community. What are the odds of this second fix? Well, that precise amendment was proposed -- and adopted -- in the Georgia legislature as it considered a RFRA comparable to Indiana's.  The result: the bill's sponsors tabled it, noting that the exception for local nondiscrimination laws would \"gut\" the bill. That reaction shines a light on the true motivations for these RFRAs.  If these acts aren't about discrimination, then why would ensuring nondiscrimination protections \"gut\" the bill? It's because these bills truly are about permitting discrimination against the LGBT community.  All of the hand-waving by Gov. Pence and others cannot distract from the truth: RFRAs are the first responses to LGBT advances.","highlights":"Tim Holbrook: Indiana's law allows discrimination against the LGBT community .\nHe says the state governor and others are using religion act as an excuse ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Michael Douglas' son Dylan had a run-in with anti-Semitism -- and the actor wants to do something about it. In an opinion column for the Los Angeles Times, the producer and \"Wall Street\" Oscar winner described an incident last summer in an unidentified country in \"southern Europe.\" The older of his two children with actress Catherine Zeta-Jones, 14-year-old Dylan, came to his father in tears. \"A man at the pool had started hurling insults at him,\" Douglas writes. It wasn't because of anything Dylan did, he continued: \"Suddenly I had an awful realization of what might have caused the man's outrage: Dylan was wearing a Star of David.\" Douglas went to talk to the man -- \"it was not a pleasant discussion,\" he writes -- and the incident has stayed in his mind. The 70-year-old actor, who was raised by a Jewish father, Kirk Douglas, and a non-Jewish mother, said he didn't identify as Jewish while growing up but noticed anti-Semitic remarks others made. \"With little knowledge of what it meant to be a Jew, I found myself passionately defending the Jewish people. Now, half a century later, I have to defend my son,\" he writes. \"Anti-Semitism, I've seen, is like a disease that goes dormant, flaring up with the next political trigger.\" Douglas, who is also a United Nations messenger of peace, observes that anti-Semitism has been on the rise due to a number of factors, including income inequality, religious extremism and hatred of Israel. \"Some find Jews to be a convenient scapegoat rather than looking at the real source of their problems,\" he says. He praises leaders such as Pope Francis, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls and Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York for their efforts at reconciliation and community-building. But it isn't enough, he adds. \"All of us\" must fight anti-Semitism, he says. \"If we confront anti-Semitism whenever we see it, if we combat it individually and as a society, and use whatever platform we have to denounce it, we can stop the spread of this madness,\" he writes. \"My son is strong. He is fortunate to live in a country where anti-Semitism is rare. But now he too has learned of the dangers that he as a Jew must face. It's a lesson that I wish I didn't have to teach him, a lesson I hope he will never have to teach his children.\" Douglas received the 2015 Genesis Prize for \"exceptional people whose values and achievements will inspire the next generation of Jews.\"","highlights":"Michael Douglas' son was insulted at a pool because of his Judaism .\nDouglas warns that anti-Semitism is on the rise .\nThe award-winning actor wants more action to \"confront anti-Semitism\""}

{"article":"(CNN)A federal judge has ordered the Defense Department to release photos that allegedly show detainees being abused in detention centers in Iraq and Afghanistan during the Bush administration. The photos won't be made public right away. In an order issued Friday, U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of the Southern District of New York granted the government 60 days to appeal. The ACLU sued the Defense Department in 2003 to have the photos made public. It's not clear how many photos are involved or where the pictures were taken, but in an August opinion Hellerstein said the government acknowledged having at least 29 pictures from at least seven different locations in Afghanistan and Iraq and may have hundreds or thousands more. Some of the photos may have come from the notorious Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. In 2004, photos became public that showed American soldiers abusing Abu Ghraib detainees and putting them into humiliating sexual positions. People in the Mideast and Americans were outraged and shocked by the photos, which added to the national debate on the use of torture in the war on terror. Hellerstein said the government failed to prove its argument that releasing the photos would endanger American soldiers or civilians overseas. In July 2011, the judge blocked release of the photos at the urging of the secretary of defense because U.S. troops were still fighting in Iraq. By December 2011, most U.S. ground troops had withdrawn from Iraq, the judge wrote, and he didn't know whether release of the photos would affect military operations. \"Three years is a long time in war, the news cycle and the international debate over how to respond to terrorism,\" he wrote. The judge also said the government failed to convince him a collective review of the photos met the requirements of the Protected National Security Documents Act. The ACLU argued the Defense Department must individually review each photo and explain why its release would put Americans in danger. Jameel Jaffer, ACLU deputy legal director, said in a statement that the photos are \"the best evidence of what took place in the military's detention centers, and their disclosure would help the public better understand the implications of some of the Bush administration's policies.\" A response by the Pentagon to the judge's decision was not immediately available. The Pentagon has refused to release the photos requested by the ACLU, saying publication could endanger American soldiers and civilians overseas. Several U.S. military leaders who saw some of the pictures made that argument in a December 19 filing in the lawsuit. They pointed to public demonstrations in Mideast countries that followed reports of Quran burnings, the release of the video \"Innocence of the Muslims\" and the 2012 release of a video that showed Americans soldiers urinating on dead enemy combatants. Navy Rear Adm. Sinclair Harris of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Islamist extremist groups like ISIS use \"imagery associated with United States detention practices\" as part of their recruiting efforts. The ACLU responded by saying the military leaders didn't see all the photos, just a sampling selected by an army lawyer. The ACLU also said the leaders didn't explain how the photos were \"similarly inflammatory.\" Their prediction of anti-American violence was only speculation, the ACLU said. \"To allow the government to suppress any image that might provoke someone, somewhere, to violence would be to give the government sweeping power to suppress evidence of its own agents' misconduct,\" Jaffer of the ACLU said.","highlights":"The ACLU sued the Department of Defense in 2003 for photos of detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan .\nGovernment has said publication of the photos could endanger American soldiers and civilians overseas ."}
{"article":"If Eoin Morgan really believes what he said after England's miserable World Cup ended with an anti-climactic win over Afghanistan at a near-empty Sydney Cricket Ground, then they are in even more trouble than we thought. The England one-day captain was either protecting his players or is in total denial after an early World Cup exit caused by England's extreme limitations in the 50-over format being repeatedly, brutally and embarrassingly exposed. It is the only explanation for Morgan insisting he had 'no regrets' and, even more bizarrely, saying that he felt all the England players who have under-performed so spectacularly here should carry on in the one-day blue clothing. England captain Eoin Morgan insists he and his side have 'no regrets' over their early World Cup exit . Morgan (second left) walks off the field with Ian Bell (third left) as rain delays play on Friday . This was another deflating day for England even if they did win their final, meaningless group match with ease on a soggy day in Sydney against a willing but mediocre team of minnows in Afghanistan. It was a game that was hardly worth playing and one that even the 9,000 present would have been happy to see rained off so that they could watch the far more entertaining New Zealand win over Bangladesh on TV. The statistics, if we dare bring those up, will tell you that England were businesslike in restricting Afghanistan to 111 for seven off 36.2 overs before knocking off their revised target of 101 in 25 overs with 41 balls to spare. But then came another strange press conference from a captain who has been a massive disappointment since taking over from Alastair Cook on the eve of this tournament, not least with the bat. England batsman James Taylor plays a shot as Afghanistan wicket-keeper\u00a0Afsar Zazai watches on . Bell shakes hands with Afghanistan players following England's hollow consolation win at the World Cup . 'There are no regrets, absolutely not. We gave it everything,' Morgan insisted after England had managed to equal statistically their worst ever World Cup by defeating a second minnow in Afghanistan as well as Scotland. Only in 1996 have they had such a shocker, on that occasion beating just Holland and the UAE. Then came the bombshell that a team who have failed dismally to come anywhere close to the pace being set by the leading nations in this tournament should all carry on towards the 2019 World Cup. When Morgan was asked if England should make changes as they play catch-up in one-day cricket, he said: 'No, absolutely not. We haven't got guys who are coming towards the end of their careers. I don't see any reason why any of them should retire. I think we have the right calibre of squad. Guys on the outside need to be banging down the door. It's an easy thing to sit here while we're not doing well and say someone outside the squad is better. We considered everybody when we selected the squad and I still believe we had the right group of players here.' Bell plays a shot during England's match against Afghanistan at the Sydney Cricket Ground . Taylor (left) and Morgan celebrate the wicket of Afghanistan's Samiullah Shinwari during Friday's win . England batsman Alex Hales plays a shot during the final match of England's poor World Cup campaign . That may be so but if the time is not ripe for change now, then we may as well all give up on the 50-over format and go home. For instance, Ian Bell made an unbeaten 52 yesterday in his 161st one-day international but surely that must be his final appearance in a one-day shirt, whether he retires or is dropped. Also, there seems no point in either Jimmy Anderson or Stuart Broad slogging away in one-day cricket for little reward when there is the small matter of 17 Tests coming up in 10 months, starting with a tour of the West Indies.Then there is the position of the captain himself, who said he was 'hungry' to carry on at the helm. Yet Morgan is not hungry enough, it seems, to lead England in their next one-day international, against Ireland in Dublin in May. Instead he will be at the Indian Premier League even though the coach of his Hyderabad team, Tom Moody, has intimated that Morgan is a squad player and is likely to remain on the bench rather than in the action. The bottom line is that England should have been heading to Melbourne today for a World Cup quarter-final against an India team they defeated twice in the tri-series here before their world fell apart. They could even have won that and reached the semi-finals, and from there who knows what might have happened. What a wasted opportunity. What a reality check for English one-day cricket. And if Morgan truly believes that no changes need to be made now, then he is the wrong man to take England forward after this disaster of a World Cup. England's win over Afghanistan attracted only a handful of supporters to conclude a dismal World Cup . Despite their early exit the World Cup, Morgan suggests England should stick with the current squad .","highlights":"Eoin Morgan says he has 'no\u00a0regrets' over England's woeful World Cup exit .\nThe win against Afghanistan was a sorry consolation for a poor tournament .\nEngland's low-key victory was played in front of a half-empty stadium .\nBut Morgan believes England should persist with the current squad .\nHis defiant comments are certainly cause for concern for English cricket ."}

{"article":"Hong Kong (CNN)Disgraced former People's Liberation Army (PLA) general Xu Caihou has died of bladder cancer, Chinese state media has reported. He was 71. Xu, who passed away at a hospital on Sunday, became one of the highest-profile figures in China's military to be caught up in President Xi Jinping's war on corruption last year, when the government launched an investigation into him on the back of bribery allegations. The court decided not to prosecute Xu due to his illness, but said his illegal income, including the bribes he was determined to have accepted would be handled in accordance with the law. Formerly a vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission, the body which runs the two-million strong PLA, Xu was also expelled from the Chinese Communist Party and had his rank of general revoked, according to a statement from the state-run Xinhua news agency. A seven-month investigation, which began in March last year, found that Xu took advantage of his position to assist the promotion of other people. He confessed to accepting bribes personally and through his family. He was also found to have sought profits for others in exchange for bribes taken through his family members. The amount he received was \"extremely huge,\" the statement added. In Chinese President Xi Jinping's annual New Year speech, he reiterated China's \"zero-tolerance\" stance towards corruption, vowing to keep \"waving high the sword against corruption\" and \"fastening the cage of regulations.\" 2014 saw Xi take down two top officials in China's fight against corruption, in addition to Xu. He took down former domestic security czar Zhou Yongkang, likely soon to become the most senior Chinese official ever to face corruption charges, and Ling Jihua, a top aide to ex-President Hu Jintao. State media have touted the trio as the three biggest \"tigers\" caught in Xi's now-two year old anti-graft campaign, which has a stated goal of targeting both \"tigers and flies\" -- high-and low-ranking officials.","highlights":"Xu, a former vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, dies of bladder cancer .\nThe official was the most senior military leader to face corruption charges in recent memory .\nStatement: Xu took advantage of his position to promote others and take bribes ."}
{"article":"(CNN)The attack on Tunisia's famed Bardo Museum is just the latest evidence that parts of North and sub-Saharan Africa have become a magnet for Islamist extremism. Tunisia -- lying just across the Mediterranean from Europe, but bordered on one side by Libya and on the other by Algeria -- has until now not suffered the kind of large-scale terror attacks seen in both those nations in recent years. But it has emerged as a place of increasing concern as the threat of Islamist extremism has intensified in the region. Islamist terrorists also have struck in Algeria, where they killed at least 37 hostages at a gas field in 2013, and in Libya, where terrorists killed the U.S. ambassador and three others in 2012 and where ISIS has established a beachhead in the east. Al Qaeda's North African offshoot Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which has its roots in Algeria, has captured territory in Mali and taken hostages -- often Europeans -- in countries such as Niger and Mauritania. So what is the world doing about it? The United States has created a military command in Africa and also established a special operations base in Djibouti, which borders Somalia in the Horn of Africa. France has sent troops to Mali. And, as CNN recently reported from Chad, Western militaries have trained special forces from several northern African nations to take on the Islamists. Here's a country-by-country look -- although not exhaustive -- at how Islamist extremism has reared its head across a swath of Africa. Algeria is home to a long-running Islamist insurgency. In perhaps the highest-profile incident, Islamist militants attacked the In Amenas oil and gas plant in southern Algeria in January 2013. At least 37 hostages, including three U.S. citizens, died in the seizure of, and ensuing special forces assault on, the remote facility. Dozens of assailants also died in the days-long siege. The attack was the work of the Mulathameen Brigade, which translates as the \"Signatories in Blood Brigade.\" Last September, another Islamist group beheaded a 55-year-old French hiker, Herve Gourdel, after seizing him as he walked in Djudjura National Park in central Algeria. Days earlier, the outfit -- Jund al Khilafa, a splinter group of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -- had pledged allegiance to ISIS. Militants affiliated with AQIM had previously also kidnapped foreigners in Algeria, including Italians and Spaniards. In 2007, AQIM launched a suicide bombing campaign in Algeria, which included a deadly bombing against the U.N. headquarters in Algiers. In January, a suicide bombing and gun attack on a hotel in the capital, Tripoli, killed 10 people, including an American. The attack was swiftly claimed by Wilayat al-Tarabulus, ISIS' name for the province. Politicians in Tripoli disputed the claim. Besides its growing presence in Tripoli, ISIS is now the dominant force in Derna in eastern Libya and controls parts of the town center of Sirte, the hometown of former Libya strongman Moammar Gadhafi. Before the advent of ISIS, an Islamist group called Ansar al Shariah was blamed by the United States for carrying out the September 11,  2012, attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi in which Ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed. State Department computer expert Sean Smith and former U.S. Navy SEALs Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, then acting as security contractors, also died. In 2012, Islamist extremists capitalized on chaos in Mali after a military coup and uprising by Tuareg tribesmen to seize control of a large piece of northern Mali, an area the size of France. France intervened militarily in early 2013 and helped to push back the Islamists. Since then, Mali's government has battled various rebel factions, mostly in its northern region, with the help of French and African forces. Recent attacks include a shooting earlier this month at a bar popular with expatriates in the capital, Bamako, which killed five people, including French and Belgian citizens, authorities said. A North African jihadist group, al-Murabitun, claimed responsibility for the attack, according to Mauritanian news agency Al Akhbar. AQIM issued a warning to France via jihadist websites in January, following terror attacks in Paris, stating that \"France pays the cost of its violence on Muslim countries and the violation of their sanctity,\" citing the presence of its soldiers in Mali. According to analysis by Jane's Defence Weekly, despite the shift of jihadist activity east toward Libya, \"Mauritania is still an aspirational target for jihadist groups due to its military co-operation with France and Algeria.\" Jihadist groups including AQIM and the Mulathameen Brigade operate in the porous border areas between Mauritania, Algeria, Mali, Niger and Libya. Militants have in the past kidnapped foreign workers for ransom, including three Spaniards in 2011, according to Jane's. However, since 2011 jihadist activity in the country has declined. Mauritanian troops joined the fight against AQIM militants in Mali. Militant group Boko Haram has waged a campaign of terror in mostly northern Nigeria for over a decade. It has attacked the country's police, military, banks, bus stations and crowded markets, as well carrying out a string of church bombings. Perhaps the most notorious incident came last April, when Boko Haram militants kidnapped more than 200 teenage girls from a boarding school in Chibok, in Borno state. Most of the girls remain missing. In January this year, hundreds of Boko Haram gunmen seized the town of Baga and neighboring villages in northern Nigeria, as well as a multinational military base, leaving bodies scattered everywhere and as many as 2,000 people feared dead. The group's stated aim is to institute Sharia, or Islamic law. Earlier this month, in an audio message purportedly from leader Abubakar Shekau, Boko Haram pledged allegiance to ISIS. It had previously declared ties to AQIM. Al-Shabaab started with a goal of waging a war against the Somali government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia. It has since shifted focus to terrorist attacks in Somalia and beyond, notably neighboring Kenya. Its most high-profile attack came in that country in 2013, when gunmen struck at Nairobi's upscale Westgate mall, pulling out weapons and gunning down shoppers. The gunmen were accused of torturing some hostages before killing them. As many as 67 people died in the siege. The group has carried out numerous attacks in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, and elsewhere. Just last week, its target was government offices in the city of Baidoa. It has also recently called for attacks on shopping malls in the United States, Canada and Britain. The Pentagon said this week that a key Al-Shabaab operative connected to the Westgate mall attack, named as Adan Garar, was killed recently by a U.S. drone strike. In September, Al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane was also killed in a U.S. airstrike near Barawe city. Gunmen who besieged the Bardo Museum in Tunis are thought to have claimed 23 lives, most of them foreign tourists. Interior Ministry spokesman Mohamed Ali Aroui told national radio that the assailants were Islamists, but authorities haven't been more specific than that. Nine arrests have been made in connection with the attack. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack in an audio message posted online Thursday. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the audio statement. The attack occurred even as the country's democratically elected Parliament was meeting to discuss new anti-terror legislation. Up to 3,000 Tunisians are believed to have traveled to Iraq and Syria to fight as jihadists, more than any other country, according to the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization in London. The fear is that many of these fighters will return to North Africa to join ISIS-affiliated groups there and carry out attacks. Al Qaeda's North African affiliate is also a threat. In late 2012, AQIM set up a branch in Tunisia called the Uqba ibn Nafi Brigade, a 60-strong Jihadi outfit composed of Tunisians, Algerians, and some Libyans. The group, believed to include fighters driven out of Mali by French forces, has been responsible for a string of attacks on Tunisian security services in mountainous Djebel Chaambi region along the Algerian border. CNN's Tim Lister and Paul Cruickshank contributed to this report.","highlights":"Islamist extremism poses a growing threat in parts of North and sub-Saharan Africa .\nExtremist groups operating in Africa include ISIS, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Al Shabaab and Boko Haram ."}
{"article":"Bradford striker Jon Stead was disappointed his side could not battle past Reading and into the semi-finals of the FA Cup. The teams will have to do it all again at the Madejski Stadium after a hard-fought clash ended in a 0-0 draw in West Yorkshire. After the highs of victories over Chelsea and Sunderland, Bradford were left frustrated, with Stead telling BT Sport: 'It was a dogfight. Jon Stead (left) is disappointed his side couldn't beat Reading despite dominating for long periods . Hope Akpan (centre) goes past Francois Zoko during the FA quarter-final clash at Valley Parade . 'We are disappointed because we feel we can do better. 'In the second half we pinned them in for long spells but we needed a goal. We limited them to a few chances.

Manager Phil Parkinson was more upbeat, saying on BT Sport: 'Were still in the hat so we're pleased with that. 'You've got to give Reading credit, they came and made it difficult. It was a cagey old affair. I thought our lads did excellently in a different type of way than Sunderland. Phil Parkinson (centre) was pleased with his side's overall performance in a tightly fought encounter . 'We had to be very professional and wait for the moment to arrive. Unfortunately it didn't.

Everyone will be expecting Reading to win that one but you never know what can happen on the night. We know they'll approach it differently and look to open up. 'When we went to Stamford Bridge, it was a day out, no one expected us to get through.' Reading set out their stall early on to be hard to beat but manager Steve Clarke knows the job is far from done yet. The facial injury received by Alex Pearce showed how physically demanding the contest was . He said: 'We came here and decided to roll up our sleeves. We knew we'd have to battle, fight for every second ball and see if we could produce something. 'We hit the post twice and on another day we could have nicked something. But it was a fair result. 'There was never really a moment where I was too worried. We were in the game from the first minute, and we were determined to get them back to our place if that was the best we could do. 'I think both teams will fancy their chances so let's get it on.'","highlights":"Jon Stead feels his side should of come away with victory against Reading .\nBradford drew 0-0 at Valley Parade despite dominating for long periods .\nManager Phil Parkinson thinks his players performed brilliantly throughout ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Lynn Smith used to lead a fast-paced life as the owner of a London-based  film props company. However her first love has always been art. Taking the plunge into the unknown, Smith decided to sell her business, say goodbye to her friends, and move to Mauritius to pursue a career as an artist full time. \"I was passionate about my business as well, it was amazing, my job was wonderful,\" Smith says, \"but I always wanted to be an artist since I was very, very young. A teacher put me off it at school and I didn't go down that road, and I regretted it.\" Smith chose Mauritius because she had fallen in love with the lush beauty of the tropical island on previous trips to visit her son, who lives there. Her studio, where she paints portraits and carves sculptures out of marble, clay and bronze, is by the sea, and Smith says she is endlessly inspired by the natural beauty of her adopted home. \"I go out every day driving around, every day you see things that are inspirational. Getting up in the morning I sit on the terrace, I look out to the sea, to the islands,\" she says. The artist, who goes by the moniker Lynni, says her new life is a dream come true, but a dream that she created not by wishing for it, but working to make it happen. \"If you want to do something you just have to get off your backside and do it yourself because nobody else is going to do it,\" she says. \"All my life I blamed that careers teacher and then I realized it was stupid to blamer her, it was my fault. I didn't follow my dream. And it got to the stage where I realized it's time to follow my dream,\" she adds.","highlights":"Lynn Smith used to work in the movie industry in London .\nShe changed her career to become an artist in Mauritius ."}
{"article":"Eoin Reddan knows the Six Nations\u2019 staggered final-day format leaves second-placed Ireland poised to be agonisingly pipped at the post in the same way as in 2007, but says they just need to deal with it. Ireland handsomely beat Italy eight years ago on the final Saturday of the tournament but France, playing last that day, went into their game knowing a 24-point win over Scotland would bag the title. They won by 27, a late try denying Eddie O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s side. Now it\u2019s leaders England who have the scheduling advantage, as their game against France this weekend starts at 5pm following Ireland\u2019s 2.30 kick-off in Scotland. Eoin Reddan (centre) knows his side are likely to miss out on the Six Nations title after defeat to Wales . However, Reddan accepts the rules are the rules, claiming it would be \u2018crazy\u2019 to be critical of the organisers just a few days before the curtain comes down on the 2015 campaign. \u2018It is the way it is and it presents different challenges,\u2019 said the back-up scrum half. \u2018The teams that play early, they have got the mental battle of having to win the game and push on and the teams that play late have a target they can chase. \u2018It\u2019s a flip of a coin whether you say that makes it more interesting or less interesting. TV rights would probably make the conversation null and void, the amount of money TV provides for Six Nations. The fact that they all want to watch three games is probably the real answer and there is no other way they\u2019re going to do it.\u2019 VIDEO Wales dash Ireland's Grand Slam hopes . Irish players make a last ditch effort to get the ball over the line during the Six Nations clash in Cardiff . Reddan came off the bench in Rome in 2007, a day when long-serving hooker Rory Best and current assistant coach Simon Easterby started in the pack. Ireland were 34 points to the good with time almost up only for Denis Leamy to tap a penalty in the hope of adding to his team\u2019s eight-try tally. Instead, they were turned over and Italy scored a converted try through Roland de Marigny to crucially help France\u2019s cause. Reddan hasn\u2019t forgotten its consequences. \u2018I remember us conceding a try late on that lost us the trophy, which we shouldn\u2019t have conceded. We should have beaten Italy by that extra bit and we would have won the trophy. Simon Zebo is upended during his sides' loss to Wales which ended their Grand Slam hopes . \u2018It\u2019s galling, but you do know the rules. You do know what time the games are on. \u2018We\u2019re not really stepping back trying to judge the competition because it\u2019s not really going to change, is it? \u2018Especially for me, a few days out from this one, to be reflecting that the competition is a bit \u201coff\u201d would be crazy. At the end of the day, we\u2019re playing second and we\u2019re going to have a job to do from the start and that job may change as the game goes on or it may not,\u2019 added Reddan. \u2018The way to win a title is probably not to think about a title,\u2019 he added. \u2018It\u2019 s frustrating listening to us because you want to grasp on to the fact that we want to go and win the title and all that, but we have a responsibility where there is no margin for error, no margin for anything. Scott Williams (bottom) is congratulated by his Welsh team mates as they defeated Ireland last Saturday . \u2018We can\u2019t even live in that world (of title talk) so that is why we give you what we give you in terms of having to win the game first, because if you take your eye off that for a second there is no championship, there is no win. \u2018Treating Scotland as if there isn\u2019t a championship on the line is the key. Realising how good they are, realising their threats and treating them just as you would if this game didn\u2019t need to be a points margin (win), treating them like that and keeping it on for the whole game. \u2018There were games last year, like against Italy, which got us over the line in the overall. It was 12 points in the last three minutes. That is just about going and going and going again and not getting too carried away with the big picture, just doing your own little thing a bit harder, a bit faster and just keeping that mindset going all the time. \u2018We have the responsibility of letting people dream and think big but our responsibility is to focus on the small little things and keep doing it to the end.\u2019 Ireland need to better England's score by four points if they want to win the coveted Six Nations crown .","highlights":"Eoin Reddan says his Ireland side know they're to be pipped to the title .\nThe scrum half doesn't blame the schedule changes for television .\nIreland lie in second with England top of the RBS Six Nations table .\nClick here for all the latest Six Nations news ."}

{"article":"Scott Arfield believes Burnley have it in them to shock Manchester City again when the Premier League champions visit Turf Moor on Saturday. The Clarets pulled off arguably their most eye-catching result of the season at the Etihad in December when they fought back from two down at half-time to claim a 2-2 draw thanks to goals from George Boyd and Ashley Barnes. It epitomised Burnley's against-the-odds fighting spirit and the memory will spur them on this weekend. Burnley midfielder Scott Arfield (right) believes his side can cause an upset against Manchester City . Arfield chases Liverpool defender Alberto Monreno (right) during the Premier League game at Anfield . Midfielder Arfield said: 'It was quite evident the mentality we've got in the squad and obviously coming from two goals down at a stadium like that, backs to the wall, and getting a point, we can take a lot of heart from that. 'We know it's going to be difficult. We're not in a fairyland where we think it's going to be easy, but we know what we've got in the dressing room. We know we're going to work for each other and technically and ability-wise we've got that as well. 'Last time at half-time we knew one goal could change it, and it did, and we had chances to win it as well. First half they were superb and we knew if they got the next goal it was going to be very difficult for us. 'But you get a goal and, no matter who you're playing against, it's going to take its toll. We started getting control of the ball and passing it about and then Barnesy turned up with a wonderful finish.' Burnley followed up the point against City by claiming a draw at Newcastle and then beating QPR but since then times have been tougher. They are without a win in two months after failing to turn good performances into points, although they did hold Chelsea to a draw in a game now better remembered for Barnes' controversial challenge on Nemanja Matic. The fixture list has not been kind, with the Clarets facing Manchester United and Liverpool along with Chelsea over the past month while matches against Southampton, Tottenham and Arsenal follow the City clash.

'When you're playing against your Cities, Liverpools, Uniteds, they're the games you look forward to at the start of the fixture list, the ones you want to play in. 'Every game's enjoyable in this division but when you're playing the big boys you want to get on the ball and show what you can do.' Burnley's fate is likely to be decided by their home form, and Arfield knows they cannot afford more of the slips that saw them fail to turn leads against Crystal Palace and West Brom into wins. 'It's massive,' said the Scot. 'With the fans behind us, last season it was a fortress at times, people didn't want to come and play against us at home. 'This season we need to get back to that.

{"article":"(CNN)The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria is making headlines again. On Wednesday, images began circulating from the city of Raqqa in Syria of a man being thrown off a building, allegedly after a conviction for a homosexual act. The scene is sickening and horrifying. And it's meant to be, because ISIS is not only killing individuals it accuses of homosexuality -- it is trying to spread terror among people who do not conform to traditional ideas about what women and men should look like, do, or say. This latest execution is the eighth that ISIS has claimed it carried out for sodomy. In addition, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) has reported the murders of four more men, also accused of sodomy, who were killed in similar style by ISIS in Syria. ISIS is allegedly also responsible for stoning at least three women in Syria accused of adultery. It's clear that these chilling spectacles are staged with the intent to terrorize. Some of the men were photographed either being thrown from the tops of tall buildings or stoned or shot to death (and in some cases both). In its social media postings about the executions, ISIS shows victims being brought to a city center, with militants purporting to read from a self-styled \"court\" ruling before conducting the execution in front of a crowd. A final picture usually depicts a lifeless body. The militia's propaganda machine gathers local communities and posts images on social media with a clear intention: to warn against any kind of transgression and spread terror. The International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC), of course, condemns these acts. But it is also important to note that we have very little information on the executions themselves. Indeed, despite our efforts, and those of other independent observers, neither the accusations nor the exact nature, time, and location of the executions can be corroborated. We know nothing about the victims' sexual orientation or gender identity. Without evidence or independent confirmation, we must therefore be cautious about assuming anything about the individuals involved. Still, whatever the uncertainties in these individual cases, as IGLHRC and the women's rights organization MADRE have\u00a0asserted, the public and gruesome nature of these executions, and ISIS's previous threats against those who commit what they deem to be \"sodomy,\" raise concerns for anyone in Iraq or Syria who does not conform to traditional ideas about \"proper\" women and men. And the reality is that these most recent executions are certain to heighten alarm and psychological suffering among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals -- and indeed terrorize the population generally -- in the areas under ISIS's control. For Iraqi individuals who are perceived to deviate from prevailing gender norms, living under the rule of ISIS means living with the constant shadow of a potential death sentence, as pointed out in our report with MADRE and the Baghdad-based Organization of Women's Freedom in Iraq. Where do we go from here? There are no shortcuts or easy answers to stopping the violence of ISIS. The antidote to their bleak worldview will be long-term and hard-won, rooted in the tenacity and wisdom of resilient local communities. However, the international community must act urgently to protect lives and help those fleeing violence today. Internal and external resettlement of persecuted people should be stepped up with greater financial support to U.N. agencies and human rights NGOs who work directly with vulnerable people. Meanwhile, applications for asylum by persecuted individuals should be expedited. We cannot sit idly by while ISIS commits wanton violence in the name of protecting \"morality.\"","highlights":"ISIS images claim to show gay men being thrown off buildings .\nJessica Stern: Antidote to their bleak worldview will be long-term and hard-won ."}
{"article":"(CNN)If you were the member of a minority group and tried to create a system to control and oppress the majority, you could not have done a better job than the white leaders of Ferguson, Missouri. Let's start with the demographics. Ferguson is small -- roughly 20,000 residents -- and is 67% black and 29% white. Over the past decade, Ferguson's population has changed from majority white to majority black. Its elected officials did not. Five of six City Council members are white, as is the city's mayor. How does this happen in a city two-thirds black? Two answers: timing of elections and type of elections. Ferguson, like most municipalities, holds elections in April of odd-numbered years. However research shows that such \"off-cycle\" elections reduces voter turnout. Ferguson also holds nonpartisan elections, which means that there are no party labels on the ballot. This not only reduces the likelihood that people will vote, it also has been shown to reduce what voters know about the candidates. Although Missouri does not track the race of its voters, according to an article in The Washington Post, Catalist, a private voter data firm, performed a study and found that the voting rules operating in Ferguson effectively suppress the black vote. In the national election in November 2012, the study found, voter turnout between blacks (54%) and whites (55%) was virtually identical. But because of the vast racial differences in the city's population, it resulted in an electorate that was 71% black and 28% white. Fast-forward five months later in April, when whites were three times (17%) more likely to vote than blacks (6%). That resulted in an electorate that was majority white: 52% versus 47%. That is how a majority-black population winds up with almost all-white elected representatives. Ferguson's law enforcement officers are also not representative, with roughly 94% of its police force being white. Similarly Ferguson's local judges are nonrepresentative. I'm sensing a pattern here. Local judges are appointed by the Ferguson City Council upon nomination by the mayor for a two-year term. The Ferguson Municipal Court is also all-white. But the black citizens of Ferguson apparently keep the police and local judges very busy. In 2013, Ferguson had the highest number of warrants issued in the state, when you control for size: 3.6 pending arrest warrants per household and 2.2 arrest warrants on average per person. And 95% of people arrested for jaywalking in Ferguson are black. While 67% of the population is black, 86% of vehicle stops involve a black driver. While 29% of the population is white, 12.9% of vehicle stops involve a white driver. Blacks were almost twice as likely to be searched as whites, even though searches of blacks were less likely than whites to result in contraband being found (21% vs. 34%). Nobody said racism made sense. But for Ferguson, it has made money. In prior years Ferguson tried to raise sales tax but learned the hard way that it did not result in increased revenue because people voted with their feet and took their wealth with them. Ferguson turned to a different revenue source: collecting traffic fines and penalties from the largely black population. Those revenues constitute Ferguson's second-highest revenue source. Once a resident gets a ticket and does not appear in court with an explanation, an arrest warrant is likely issued. Once arrested, the resident may sit in jail for a very long time, while the fees and fines continue to accrue. A class-action lawsuit filed this month against the city of Ferguson has challenged this funding system, calling it a \"modern debtors' prison scheme.\" The remarkable part of this story is how patient the black residents of Ferguson have been.

Everton\u2019s dreams of winning the Europa League evaporated spectacularly on Thursday when they were beaten 5-2 by Dynamo Kiev and now they have nothing to play for other than trying to salvage some respectability in the Barclays Premier League. It is a far cry from what Baines and his team-mates anticipated at the beginning of the campaign but the performance in Kiev was indicative of how wretched Everton's form has been.

Everton's James McCarthy, Tim Howard, Phil Jagielka and Leighton Baines stand dejected after conceding . England left back Baines admits that Everton players are fighting for their future after difficult season . They now have nine games left to move away from the fringes of the relegation battle, starting tomorrow at Queens Park Rangers, and Baines has accepted if the situation does not improve, there is likely to be a summer of change at Goodison Park. \u2018You have got your own personal standards,\u2019 said Baines. \u2018In the last few seasons, we have been striving for something towards the end.

{"article":"Omaha, Nebraska (the Heartland Project)When Ryan Sallans, an activist in the Nebraska transgender community, first went to the doctor in 2005 to talk about what he medically needed to do for his gender transition, his doctor wanted to offer medical help. That was the good news. The disconcerting news was the doctor had to Google the issue first to figure out the best medical advice. \"My provider just did a Web search to figure out what dose of hormones I should be on, and put me on the highest dose,\" Sallans said.  That could have been a dangerous choice. \"Starting too high of a dose too quickly can cause a lot of health problems, particularly to cardiovascular health.\" Fortunately, Sallans didn't have any health complications. But his experience left him with a mission. He volunteers to speak with medical institutions, as well as with businesses and colleges, to urge them to be more LGBT inclusive. While a growing number of medical schools are teaching future doctors how to address health concerns that can be specific to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities, studies show current doctors only get about five hours of training, if they get any at all. The transgender life: What to know, say and understand . For members of the LGBT community who live in more rural and conservative areas like Nebraska, the struggle to get good, or at least up-to-date, medical care may be even more difficult. In general, legal protections and institutional supports for LGBT Nebraskans are already thin, spotty or nonexistent. On March 2, the United States District Court struck down Nebraska's ban on marriage for same-sex couples, but that ruling is on appeal. Then there were 12: Nebraska ordered to end same-sex marriage ban . Without the legal institution of marriage, LGBT Nebraskans typically lack family health benefits, unless their employers provide them to same-sex partners. A 2014 study from the Williams Institute at the University of California Los Angeles found that states without LGBT legal protections in place see lower rates of health insurance coverage for LGBT residents than states with protections. That plays out in Nebraska. A 2014 study from researchers at the University of Nebraska Omaha found that LGBT residents in the rural parts of the state have lower rates of health insurance coverage than their counterparts in urban areas. Time to close HIV's racial disparities . Even when LGBT Nebraskans have health insurance, they struggle to find providers versed in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender heath care needs. Research shows that LGBT individuals often experience health issues linked to being regular targets of discrimination or social stigma. Discrimination has been linked to higher rates of substance abuse, suicide and stress-related illnesses, which can include heart problems, obesity, eating disorders and cancer. If the available doctors are not familiar with the increased rates of these issues, they may provide inadequate care. Patients who find their doctors do not understand their issues may also delay treatment, often with bad health outcomes, said Jay Irwin, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Nebraska-Omaha and a researcher in LGBT health. Sometimes patients are turned away by providers who don't want to treat LGBT patients, particularly if there are no laws to prohibit such discrimination. Irwin has completed studies that focus on the health care challenges of lesbians in rural areas and found that many people feel isolated and are afraid to come out -- or risk discrimination in the medical office. Supreme Court same sex marriage decision could impact election . Nebraska's sheer size doesn't help. Sixteenth largest in the nation by geography, members of its LGBT community often live far from large cities with significant LGBT populations and with teaching hospitals with staff members who have experience working with members of that community. The Human Rights Campaign's 2014 Healthcare Equality Index named four Nebraska health care facilities, all in Omaha, as leaders in LGBT health care equality. Omaha is on the state's eastern border with Iowa. LGBT residents in western Nebraska -- for instance, places like North Platte -- have to travel 270 miles in either direction, to Omaha or Denver, Colorado, to reach facilities designated as leaders by the Human Rights Campaign. People who work within the health care system have seen some improvement when it comes to treating members of the LGBT community. Jill Young is the client services manager at Nebraska AIDS Project's Scottsbluff, Nebraska, office in the western part of the state. She recalled when she started working there in the late 1990s she saw medical staff refuse care to LGBT people with HIV\/AIDS. HIV deaths among African-Americans drop 18%, CDC says . \"We had nurses, for example, who said they wouldn't serve patients with HIV\/AIDS,\" Young said. \"But we've come a long way since then.\" Young has seen more hospitals in the region adopting policies that are supportive of LGBT residents, including one that just started recognizing same-sex partners' wills as legal documents that will allow them access to their partners when they are being cared for in areas restricted to immediate family only. But she said she still sees too many LGBT residents traveling great distances to get care and she still sees too many patients who don't seek medical care until it is too late. \"We still go to the hospital,\" she said, \"and see people who are days away from dying.\" Eric Yarwood, 44, has more experience than he would like with Nebraska's health care facilities. He spent over 100 days last year at hospitals in Omaha for complications related to germ cell cancer. He had nine rounds of chemotherapy, three stem cell transplants, his third surgery two weeks ago and five more days for followup last week. For all but four of the days he was in the hospital, his partner, Aaron Persen, 36, was at his side every evening. \"Aaron and I are a unit,\" Yarwood said. \"I can count on my fingers the number of times he didn't come.\" While the couple has found the overwhelming majority of physicians and medical staff to be \"genuinely supportive\" of their relationship,  there still were a few instances when they felt uncomfortable and unaccepted, once with a physician and another time with a nurse. \"I'm not sure how often the medical staff works with gay couples or receives training on how to work with gay couples,\" Yarwood said. Same-sex marriage fast facts . Yarwood's prognosis is good, and the couple looks with optimism to a future of having more access to LGBT-inclusive health care facilities and a more inclusive state overall. \"Hopefully, by the time we get through the cancer and save a little money,\" Persen said, \"Nebraska will follow most other states and allow our relationship to be legally recognized.\"","highlights":"A 2014 study finds LGBT residents in rural parts of Nebraska have lower rates of health insurance coverage .\nPeople who wait to seek care, worried they won't find an LGBT-friendly doctor, can face serious medical consequences ."}

{"article":"Zlatan Ibrahimovic has apologised for any offence caused by his outburst following Paris St Germain's defeat to Bordeaux - but claims his words have been 'twisted'. Ibrahimovic is facing an investigation by the French football league (LFP) for comments made as he left the field on Sunday. The Sweden striker's two goals were not enough to prevent PSG suffering a 3-2 defeat and he was angry not to be awarded a free-kick by referee Lionel Jaffredo after Bordeaux goalkeeper Cedric Carrasso picked up a clear backpass from defender Ludovic Sane with five minutes remaining. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice but could not prevent PSG's 3-2 defeat by Bordeaux . Ibrahimovic was heard swearing as he walks towards the changing room after PSG's defeat . THe Swede reacted angrily to the defeat and said it was the worst refereeing display he'd ever seen . The PSG talisman reportedly referred to French referee\u00a0Lionel Jaffredo (centre) as an 'a******' after the game . As he walked off the field Ibrahimovic - no stranger to making controversial remarks - was filmed venting his anger. Speaking in English but in partial sentences, he can be heard saying: 'He's an a******. Play 15 years, never seen referee this s*** country. Don't even deserve PSG should be in this country. F****** too good for all of you. Should be happy they exist.' An LFP statement on Monday read: 'Following the receipt of the officials' report, the disciplinary commission of the LFP will study in its meeting of Thursday March 19 the comments made by Zlatan Ibrahimovic at the end of the game between Girondins de Bordeaux and Paris St Germain (29th round of Ligue 1).' French sports minister Patrick Kanner called on the Swede to apologise, which he later did in a post on his Instagram account. And talking to PSG's website on Monday evening, Ibrahimovic reiterated: 'First of all, I was not aiming for the people. 'When I said it, I was angry at that moment. Whoever felt offended, or took it in the wrong way, I apologise. Ibrahimovic looks generally unimpressed as his side fall to defeat that leaves them second in Ligue 1 . Ibrahimovic faces investigation over his comments, which included calling France a 's*** country' The Sweden legend scores a goal past Bordeaux keeper\u00a0Cedric Carrasso during the away game . Ibrahimovic removes his shirt after the game to reveal his impressive collection of tattoos . 'I have no problem with that. I'm a man of honour, I stand by my things I do, and I apologise. 'I think that whoever saw it, or however the media is trying to twist it, I think the French people are intelligent enough to understand the situation. 'The welcome I have had here, I'm very happy. I respect people who respect me, every day I go through here I've had a fantastic time. 'I have no regrets and nobody will change my opinion. From the first day I came, I had a good time and I will continue to have a good time. 'So don't twist it, it's about football we talk, so let's focus on the football. The football here is the most important (thing) for me.' Ibrahimovic's comments towards Jaffredo come less than a week after he was sent off in his side's Champions League victory over Chelsea and accused the Blues' players of acting like 'babies' after they surrounded referee Bjorn Kuipers. Ibrahimovic had previously accused Chelsea of acting like 'babies' during their Champions League defeat . Injured team-mate Serge Aurier faces UEFA disciplinary action after labelling Kuipers a 'dirty son of a bitch' in a video posted on Facebook, and the two incidents prompted a response from France's elite referees organisation SAFE (Syndicat des Arbitres du Football d'Elite). An open letter from SAFE president Stephane Lannoy on the organisation's website read: 'We thought we had seen a peak in media outcry after Chelsea-PSG. We thought we had heard everything. But no. 'Sunday night, for a back-pass, we had a new outburst of hatred and verbal abuse. The equation is simple: back-pass = worst referee in 15 years = s*** country. 'After Mr Kuipers on Wednesday (from what country...?), Mr Jaffredo on Sunday - and ultimately, as the cup was not yet full, the whole of France.' The letter concluded: 'It is time to realise we cannot say anything, do anything and accept anything. It is high time that finally, in football, everyone recognises the status of the referee and accepts and respects it.' Ibrahimovic has been told he should leave France by the nation's far right National Front leader Marine Le Pen. The National Front Leader told France Info Radio: 'Those who consider that France is a s*** country can leave it.

{"article":"(CNN)A Louisiana judge ruled Monday that Robert Durst, the millionaire real estate heir charged with first-degree murder, will be held without bail. That's no big surprise. In 2001 -- the last time he was accused of murder and released on bail -- Durst fled to Pennsylvania, where authorities caught him after he tried to shoplift a sandwich from a supermarket. As the attorneys sparred in court and witnesses testified Monday, they revealed new details about the investigation that led to Durst's March 14 arrest, and set the stage for what will surely be a fierce legal battle. After the hearing, Durst's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, spoke with CNN's Jean Casarez. Here are some key details from Monday's hearing and the interview: . Durst, who appeared in court wearing an orange prison uniform and shackles, was arrested after federal agents tracked his cell phone, according to information presented in court Monday. Investigators knew he'd left his Houston condo with five suitcases on March 10. And, since a warrant allowed them to track his cell phone, they saw when it pinged a tower 85 miles east, in Beaumont, Texas. But suddenly, he had stopped using it. Investigators thought the trail had gone cold. \"They had no indication of his movement,\" said Jim O'Hearn, an investigator for the Orleans Parish district attorney's office. But then, authorities tracked him to New Orleans after he called his voice mail twice from a Marriott there, O'Hearn testified. That's where FBI agents found and arrested him. Last week, court documents revealed Durst had a loaded .38-caliber revolver, 5 ounces of marijuana, his passport and birth certificate, a neck-to-head latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair attached and more than $40,000 cash, mostly in $100 bills. Among his possessions, he also had a UPS tracking number. The package was later intercepted by the FBI, prosecutors said in court Monday. It contained clothing and more than $100,000 in cash. It's a case Durst even has made himself. In \"The Jinx,\" the HBO documentary that featured him, Durst said: \"You can't give someone charged with murder bail because they're going to run away, of course. Goodbye, $250,000. Goodbye, jail. I'm out.\" In a seconds-long news conference after the hearing Monday, Durst attorney DeGuerin said he had no hope for bail and the judge's decision was not surprising. The legal team, however, did obtain \"a lot of information,\" he said, and a preliminary hearing was set for April 2. \"All in all, I think this has been a very good day for us,\" he said on the courthouse steps. He walked off without elaborating. DeGuerin cast doubt Monday on the validity of the Los Angeles arrest warrant that led to Durst's detention, and argued that items found in the hotel room search shouldn't be admissible because detectives may not have had a search warrant at the time. He also said a detective and prosecutor interrogated Durst for three hours without his attorney present. Since the weapons and drugs charges Durst faces in New Orleans are based on what investigators say they found in his hotel room, this is likely to come up again. But prosecutors argued that the matter at hand Monday was whether he is a flight risk or a danger to the community. The judge sided with the prosecution Monday. But this is just the first step in what will likely be a lengthy legal battle. \"As long as Louisiana wants us here, well, we'll stay here. We'll fight,\" DeGuerin said Monday. But the bigger courtroom fight will likely unfold in Los Angeles, where the district attorney filed a first-degree murder charge against Durst last week. Durst awaits extradition to Los Angeles to face that charge. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Prosecutors accuse Durst of \"lying in wait\" and killing Susan Berman, a crime writer and his longtime confidante, because she \"was a witness to a crime.\" Berman was shot in the head in her Beverly Hills, California, home in December 2000, shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife, Kathleen McCormack Durst. Robert Durst has long maintained he had nothing to do with Berman's death or his wife's disappearance. \"I just don't think that they had sufficient evidence to have him arrested,\" DeGuerin said Monday. \"They had a lot of suspicion. They've always had a lot of suspicion. And that television show just added to that suspicion.\" It's not the first time Durst has been accused of murder. He admitted to killing and dismembering his neighbor in a 2003 trial, but he was acquitted after arguing he acted in self-defense. FBI agents have also asked local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where Durst lived over the past five decades, a U.S. law enforcement official said. On Monday, police said there was a connection between Durst and a college student who disappeared from Vermont's Middlebury College in 1971. In response to a question at a Tuesday news conference from CNN, Middlebury Police Chief Tom Hanley said: \"There's nothing in the files to indicate (Durst) was questioned\" at the time of her disappearance. \"We don't know if they ever had any personal contact,\" the chief added.  The connection in the case was one of proximity, Hanley said. Durst owned a health-food store in Middlebury, and Lynne Schulze was last seen across the street from the store near a bus stop. She had purchased dried prunes from the store earlier. DeGuerin brushed off the accusation, saying that his client \"may have been in Chicago when Jimmy Hoffa disappeared.\" Other cases in upstate New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California are also getting a new look. Durst was placed on suicide watch, according to police, but DeGuerin said last week that Durst needed to be in a hospital setting, not because of the possibility of suicide, but because he has serious medical conditions. The 71-year-old is suffering from hydrocephalus, which required brain surgery a couple of years ago, DeGuerin said. Doctors implanted a stent on the right side of his head, the attorney said last week. \"At the same time he was in the hospital he had an operation on his esophagus to remove cancer. So he's got some serious health issues. ... He's lost a lot of weight. He's not in good health,\" DeGuerin said. Durst appeared in court Monday with his head shaved, the stent prominent. DeGuerin also said that Durst is \"mildly autistic\" and has received treatment in the past from one of the country's leading experts in Asperger's syndrome and autism. \"He's quiet and he's reserved and he's actually bashful. But he's always been looked upon as a little bit odd,\" DeGuerin said. \"And what we discovered 15 years ago was that he's autistic, mildly autistic, but it explains a lot of his, what others look upon as unusual or bizarre behavior.\" But DeGuerin said his client's health struggles don't mean he's incompetent to stand trial. And DeGuerin said they're eager to go to court and fight the accusations against him. \"He's a little frail and he has some memory problems sometimes,\" DeGuerin said. \"But he's not incompetent.\" CNN's Anne Woolsey, Amanda Watts, Jean Casarez and Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.","highlights":"Police chief in Vermont says Robert Durst owned store where college student bought prunes before she disappeared .\nDurst's attorney: \"I just don't think that they had sufficient evidence to have him arrested\"\nRobert Durst, who is charged with first-degree murder in California, awaits extradition ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Mention the words \"sand\" and \"golf\" together, and the chances are you'll leave many players shuddering at the memory of being trapped in bunkers after another wayward shot. But in other parts of the world, sand golf is a version of the game in its own right. The idea of playing a round without verdant fairways to stride down or lush greens to putt (and, of course, miss) on seems strange, even wrong. Sometimes needs must, though. Half a century ago, expat oil workers with an enthusiasm for golf had nowhere in Abu Dhabi to play. In the baking desert heat, with little or no irrigation possible, the equation was simple: they either had to adapt to the surroundings or there'd be no golf at all. The result was an incarnation of the game in which the only grass to be seen is artificial, found on a mat carried around by players to serve both as a tee and a surface from which to strike when the ball is on the fairway. Fairways? They consist entirely of sand and are indicated by marker posts. If the ball lands outside them, it's in the sand golf equivalent of the rough -- stony terrain that the unwary player may soon find is home to a few snakes and a lizard or two. Greens? Well, they're known as \"browns,\" built from clay and topped with a mixture of sand and oil to provide a true putting surface, a formula arrived at through trial and error. It's an odd environment, this golfing world with a palette of golden-brown colors. And with rapidly developing irrigation and growing techniques enabling grass courses to be built in desert climes, it's an increasingly unusual one. Back in 1961, determined British oil workers created a sand course on an atoll known as Das Island, around 100 miles off Abu Dhabi in the Persian Gulf. It was the country's first-ever golf club. As the expat population grew, so did the demand for the game, and in 1971 sand golf moved into Abu Dhabi proper with the opening of a course near the Sea Palace. Its success brought a move to the Equestrian Club, attracting close to 500 members. In the 1990s, the sand game's fortunes took a dive as the site was earmarked for a nine-hole grass course. But although many sand course players changed surface and took up the more conventional game, several battled on and the 18-hole Al Ghazal sand course was created near Abu Dhabi airport, with its front nine occupying part of an archaeological site, in 1997. Sand golf also exists in parts Australia and Africa but Al Ghazal (which translates as \"gazelle\" -- gazelles peer from behind a fence by the second brown,) is the only one that can be described as \"world class,\" says Dennis Cox, an expert on the game, because the scale and scope of its layout rivals its grass counterparts. The course found a place in the international spotlight when a World Sand Golf Championship, boasting star names including Colin Montgomerie was played in 2004 and 2005 (won by Greg Owen and Thongchai Jaidee,) but the tournament fizzled out as showpiece events went to showpiece grass courses. Maybe that's understandable when you consider some of the extra elements involved in the sand game -- the browns, for example, must be swept for a few minutes after use so that they are left smooth and footprint-less for following players, while unexpected hazards can include burrows dug by desert lizards. Cox warns that a tradition is under threat, with a form of golf that was once commonplace in danger of becoming just a memory. Other, smaller clubs have fallen by the wayside, while Al Ghazal's location near an expanding airport presents an obvious threat to its future. But even if the sand game were to fade into obscurity in the emirate, it is still played in parts of Africa. In Libya, still racked by instability following the ousting of Muammar Gaddaffi, courses -- the bulk of which can be found in the capital, Tripoli -- are of sand, with no grass versions existing. Once smart and well-kept, they have now slumped into neglect, with few people to play on them or look after them. David Bachmann, who formerly worked at the Austrian embassy in the city, wrote on his In Tripolis blog about the experience of playing sand golf in and near the city. Recounting his experiences of Tripoli's tattered nine-hole Ghargharesh course, he wrote that it was one for diehards only, \"golf fanatics that would come every weekend to play a round on this challenging course.\" And he imagined that the skeleton of the clubhouse, on which work had long since stopped, might one day boast \"marble, chandeliers and state-of-the-art locker rooms... overlooking the deep blue Mediterranean with the sun setting over the sea.\" For now, and against the odds, fans of this form of the game will just have to make do with being kings of their very own sand castles.","highlights":"Expat oil workers in Abu Dhabi built sand golf course in 1961 .\nForm of game features putting 'browns' instead of greens .\nUnexpected hazards can include the burrows of desert lizards ."}
{"article":"Fernando Alonso has expressed natural disappointment he is to sit out the season-opening Formula One grand prix in Australia, but is fully appreciative of the circumstances. On advice from doctors Alonso will have to wait for his competitive return with McLaren until the second race in Malaysia later this month. Although given a clean bill of health after sustaining concussion in a heavy crash in the second pre-season test in Barcelona on February 22, the fear of 'second-impact syndrome' has forced Alonso's hand. Fernando Alonso was involved in a high-speed crash during testing at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya . Alonso's McLaren is recovered back to the pits on the back of a truck after crashing in Barcelona . McLaren driver Alonso was taken by helicopter to hospital following the accident in Catalonia . Alonso tweeted his disappointment at not being able to make the season-opening F1 grand prix in Australia . The term refers to a second concussion occurring when the effects of the first are still subsiding, potentially resulting in severe brain injuries, or even death. Although the timespan between the accident and Alonso returning to the car for first practice in Melbourne on March 13 would appear to be sufficient, he is not prepared to take any risks. Via his Twitter account, Alonso said: 'It will be tough not to be in Australia, but I understand the recommendations. A second impact in less than 21 days 'NO' \u00a3countdownMalaysia.' For the Albert Park event Alonso's seat will now be occupied by Kevin Magnussen, demoted to reserve driver following the Spaniard's arrival after a full season with the team in 2014. A thrilled Magnussen, who will partner Jenson Button in Melbourne, tweeted: 'Shame about the circumstances but still I'm so excited to be racing in Melbourne. Can't wait!!' The 22-year-old Danish racer Kevin Magnussen will replace Alonso for McLaren at the Australian Grand Prix . To which a sporting Alonso replied: 'best of luck at the race mate! \u00a3BelieveInMcLarenHonda.' Explaining the circumstances behind the decision taken to withdraw Alonso from Australia, McLaren have revealed doctors found the 33-year-old to be 'asymptomatic', with 'no evidence whatsoever of any injury' and 'entirely healthy from neurological and cardiac perspectives'. But given the prospect of second-impact syndrome Alonso was 'advised he should not compete in the imminent Australian Grand Prix meeting'. A McLaren statement added: 'Fernando has understood and accepted that advice. Fernando's doctors acknowledge he feels fit and well, and he regards himself as ready to race. Medical staff arrived on the scene to give Alonso treatment at the side of the road after the accident . A helicopter was sent to pick up Alonso and taken him to hospital from Barcelona's\u00a0Circuit de Catalunya . Alonso was taken to hospital by helicopter after being involved in a crash at speeds of up to 150mph . 'That being the case they are comfortable with the fact he has already recommenced physical training, with a view to preparing for a return to the cockpit of his McLaren-Honda car for the Malaysian Grand Prix meeting on March 27, 28 and 29. 'Indeed, his doctors are supportive of that ambition, satisfied as they are that he sustained no damage whatsoever during his testing accident on February 22. 'All at McLaren-Honda fully support Fernando's decision in respect of his doctors' advice.' Double world champion Alonso has returned to McLaren for this season after spending the past five years with Ferrari, burying the hatchet with Group CEO Ron Dennis following an ignominious campaign with the team in 2007.","highlights":"Fernando Alonso was involved in a crash at the\u00a0Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya .\nAlonso will miss the Australian Grand Prix on March 15 after medical advice .\nDanish driver Kevin Magnussen will take Alonso's place for McLaren .\nThe details of Alonso's injuries have not been fully disclosed .\nAlonso is currently recovering in Oviedo, where he was born ."}

{"article":"(CNN)It's outrage time again. This time it's over a \"Saturday Night Live\" commercial parody that aired over the weekend. The subject (take a deep breath and prepare to be shocked): ISIS. Yes, that barbaric terrorist group was ridiculed in a parody of a Toyota Camry commercial. The original Toyota ad depicted a father driving his daughter to the airport. He then tearfully says goodbye as his daughter heads off to join the U.S. Army. In the \"SNL\" parody, the daughter is played by Dakota Johnson, star of the hugely successful S&M film \"50 Shades of Grey.\" (Good to see America has gotten over being offended by the mainstreaming of S&M.) As the parody commercial ends, however, it's revealed that the daughter is not joining the Army, but ISIS. We then see a pickup filled with ISIS fighters drive up as a worried Dad comments to his daughter: \"You be careful, OK?\" Johnson replies reassuringly: \"Dad! It's just ISIS.\" The father then turns to an ISIS fighter and says, with emotion, \"Take care of her.\" In reply, the militant whispers: \"Death to America.\" And ... cue the outrage!! Twitter lit up instantly. Twitter user @ematrudo called NBC and \"SNL\" \"Tasteless Scum!\" And Steve Bucci of conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation even went as far as to tweet: \"SNL ISIS skit also draws a moral equivalence between ISIS murderers and the U.S. Military (based on the spoofed commercial), that is wrong.\" Some, apparently in the minority if the media coverage is any indication, also praised \"SNL\": . But my favorite tweet was this one: . @kmorrison is 100% correct. The sketch mocked ISIS and on some level those who would fall for its sales pitch, like, perhaps, the three young British girls who reportedly headed to join them. Comically skewering ISIS is exactly the right thing to do -- it should be done even more. In fact, in Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates and even in Iraq, where ISIS is slaughtering people, brave Muslim comedians are ridiculing ISIS on TV, in YouTube videos and in cartoons. And I can assure you that if ISIS were to catch these comedians, it wouldn't just tweet about its outrage, it would kill them. So why do these comedians take the chance? Because, they say, it undermines ISIS, and also, for many, it is cathartic to laugh at the terrorists, as opposed to shivering in fear about them. This is the same reason Mel Brooks featured \"Springtime for Hitler\" in his hit musical comedy, \"The Producers\":  It was a way of using comedy as revenge. Brooks saw it as a way to rob Hitler of his power (even if posthumously) by causing audiences to laugh at him. What's more, the \"SNL\" parody makes an important but subtle point. On the side of the ISIS pickup, the Arabic writing does not state a religious expression. Rather it says, \"I love cats.\" As someone who worked at \"SNL\" for eight years, I can assure you this was not happenstance, but rather was by design. To me, the \"I love cats\" line shows that \"SNL\" grasps what many on the right refuse to. As I heard firsthand when I attended the White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism two weeks ago, ISIS will despicably use any means to recruit people. Consequently, as ludicrous as it may seem, saying \"we love cats\" to young girls is not beyond ISIS. When I look at the outrage over this \"SNL\" political parody, I have to wonder: Weren't we all \"Je suis Charlie Hebdo\" just a few weeks ago? Remember when we stood firmly with political satirists. Well, apparently that sentiment ended for some as soon as they saw political satire they didn't like. I understand that some will be offended by political comedy with which they don't agree. But in a time when freedom of expression is under attack, if you are offended by political satire on TV, then change the channel.","highlights":"Dean Obeidallah: Twitter blew up over \"Saturday Night Live\" skit about girl joining ISIS .\nHe says ridiculing and laughing at terrorists undermines them, diminishes their power ."}
{"article":"Leonardo Ghiraldini has urged Italy to 'keep believing' when they tackle RBS 6 Nations title contenders Wales on Saturday without their captain and world-class number eight Sergio Parisse. A foot injury suffered during last weekend's 29-0 home defeat against France has sidelined Parisse from Italy's final game of the Six Nations campaign. Leicester hooker Ghiraldini will take the armband at Stadio Olimpico in his absence, with Italy looking for a victory that would shred this season's Six Nations form-book. Italy hooker Leonardo Ghiraldini insists Italy have to keep faith in their abilities when they face Wales . The Italians will be without their talismanic captain Sergio Parisse for their final game of the tournament . 'Sergio is one of the best number eights in the world,' Ghiraldini said at a press conference in Rome on Friday. 'Of course he's a big loss for us, but at the same time, it's an opportunity for others to take responsibility. 'Sergio could play in every national team in the world, but we have to keep believing. 'There will be moments of pressure, but we must keep our mentality for every second of the game. We can still play a good game without Sergio.' Italy have scored just three points in their two Six Nations home games this season, while they were thumped 52-11 by England at the Stadio Olimpico in their final match of the tournament last term. Parisse limps off against France and has been ruled out of the game against Wales in Rome . With Parisse missing,\u00a0Ghiraldini will captain Italy, and has called on his team to show their true ability . And while they can reflect on beating Scotland at Murrayfield this time around, the campaign has proved to be another mixed bag of results. 'We have to show we are a better team than the one that turned up against France,' Ghiraldini added. 'Our win in Scotland came after two bad defeats, and we have shown that we are capable of overcoming negative moments. 'I don't know what Wales expect, but we want to show our pride. We are not thinking about denying them the title; we are focused on our own match. 'Everything starts from our first phase, and our scrum has to be at its best. We want to be accurate in every aspect of the game. 'Our discipline in kicking wasn't good last week. We made it too easy for France. Wales can keep the ball for a long time and defend for more than 30 phases, as we saw against Ireland.'","highlights":"Italy lost heavily to France last week, when Sergio Parisse was injured .\nHooker Leonard Ghrialdini insists his side can bounce back .\nGhiraldini calls on team to show they are better than France game showed ."}

{"article":"(CNN)America may be growing less hateful. That's according to an annual Southern Poverty Law Center report that says the number of hate groups in the United States remains on the decline for the second year in a row. In the \"Intelligence Report\" released Tuesday, the SPLC says the number of hate groups operating in the U.S. declined 17% between 2013 and 2014. They are now at their lowest levels since 2005, the watchdog organization said. \"Patriot groups, which are animated by a series of conspiracy theories about the alleged evils of the federal government, fell even faster, to 874 groups from a 2012 peak of 1,360 groups. In just the last year, the number of Patriot groups declined by 20%, from 1,096 groups to 874,\" the report said. \"But those numbers may be somewhat deceiving. More than half of the decline in hate groups was of Ku Klux Klan chapters, and many of those have apparently gone underground, ending public communications, rather than disbanding.\" The decline may be due to a number of factors, including the rebounding economy, law enforcement action and leadership issues within the groups, the SPLC said. The \"high social\" cost of being associated publicly with a hate group is also noted as a factor for decline, the group said. \"The atmosphere has changed,\" Mark Potok, editor-in-chief of the \"Intelligence Report,\" told reporters on a conference call. \"Overall, the groups are less important.\" People publishing messages of hate directly to the Internet is also cited as a possible reason for the decline in the organized groups. California and Florida have the largest number of hate groups, with more than 50 each. Alaska and Hawaii are the only states with no hate groups, according to the SPLC. The report tracks the number of chapters or groups, not individual members, so while the number of groups is on the decline, it's possible that some of the groups that remain have increased membership. The Ku Klux Klan experienced the largest decline of all hate groups, according to the report, losing more than 50% of its chapters. One of the oldest and most infamous hate groups in the United States, the KKK took its foothold after the Civil War, terrorizing the African-American population with intimidation and violent actions, including lynching. The Klan's growth slowed after the establishment of Jim Crow laws in the American South, according to the SPLC. The KKK's last resurgence came during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The group was again responsible for large-scale terror against the South's African-American population. In 1990, the SPLC started to keep track of the number of KKK chapters, which reached a high of 221 in 2010, in response to President Barack Obama's election, according to the report. Since then, the numbers have been on the decline. The SPLC now reports 72 chapters, down from 163 a year ago. Under Obama, 4 in 10 say race relations worsened . The reason for the decline of the Ku Klux Klan is not totally clear, though the report even suggests the groups may be going deeper underground. \"It appears that most of the groups simply faded as their leaders and members got older, but it is also very possible that many simply stopped announcing where their chapters were,\" the report said. The center estimates that between 5,000 and 8,000 people are Klan members in the United States. Opinion: America facing anti-Muslim bigotry . The SPLC report also notes that more people may be operating as so-called lone wolves. The overall number of hate groups peaked in 2011 and has been on the decline since. However, the number of registered users to Stormfront -- a website claiming to be \"the voice of the new, embattled White minority!\" -- has doubled since 2008. It now has nearly 300,000 users. Lone wolves are a concern, the report said, because 90% of all domestic terror attacks since 2009 were carried out by individuals or pairs. Lone wolf planned attack on U.S. Capitol, FBI says . The report points to neo-Nazi Frazier Glenn Miller, who allegedly killed three people in Kansas who he thought were Jewish, and an incident in Las Vegas, where an anti-government couple killed two police officers before being killed themselves, as examples of radical criminal elements acting alone. The SPLC refers to this and other indicators to say that many individuals may be moving from organized groups to the Internet, to become more anonymous. Looking towards next year, SPLC is \"expecting a real wave of Islamophobia\" because of the proliferation of ISIS and the heavy media coverage of the extremist group, Potok told reporters.","highlights":"Media coverage of ISIS could spur \"real wave of Islamophobia,\" report's editor says .\nThe number of hate groups across the U.S. dropped 17% from 2013 to 2014, the report says .\nIn particular, the number of KKK chapters dropped from 163 to 72 in a year, it says ."}
{"article":"Boston (CNN)Jurors in the Boston Marathon bombings trial were shown a key piece of evidence Tuesday: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's writings on the inside of the boat he used as a hideout. Prosecutors presented photos of three panels of the boat that had messages written in pencil. Boston police Officer Todd Brown, a bomb squad member who cleared the boat of explosives, was on the witness stand to talk about the writings. Tsarnaev is charged with 30 counts related to the April 15, 2013, bombings that killed three people and wounded more than 260 others. A fourth person, an MIT police officer, was ambushed and killed in his patrol car three days after the bombings as Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, allegedly ran from police. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed after a gunbattle with police. On Tuesday, Brown identified Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in court as the man he saw come out of the boat and get taken into custody. In the writings on the panels, some of Tsarnaev's words were struck out by bullet holes. \"I'm jealous of my brother who ha (bullet hole) ceived the reward of jannutul Firdaus (inshallah) before me,\" one of the writings said, referring to the word for paradise. \"I do not mourn because his soul is very much alive. God has a plan for each person. Mine was to hide in this boat and shed some light on our actions.\" Tsarnaev's connections: Who's who . Tsarnaev's defense has argued that he indeed participated in the bombings, but that he was influenced by his radicalized brother. In his writings on the boat, Tsarnaev asked Allah to allow him to reach the highest levels of heaven. \"The US Government is killing our innocent civilians but most of you already know that. As a (bullet hole) I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished. We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all. Well at least that's how muhhammad (bullet hole) wanted it to be (for)ever,\" Tsarnaev wrote in the boat. Also Tuesday, prosecutors called on FBI agent Steve Kimball to discuss two Twitter accounts linked to Tsarnaev. One, @J_tsar, contained 1,100 tweets and was the more mainstream of the two. \"I shall die young,\" @J_tsar tweeted on April 12, 2012. And four days later, on the day of the 2012 Boston Marathon, a tweet from the account read, \"They will spend their money & they will regret it & they will be defeated.\" Timeline of the bombings, manhunt and aftermath . Prosecutors argued that these tweets indicate an attack on the Boston Marathon was on his mind a year before the bombings. Tsarnaev attorney Miriam Conrad, who opted not to cross-examine the bombing survivors who testified during the first week of the trial, got Kimball to acknowledge that some of his information about the tweets came from other agents and that he didn't check them out for himself. Conrad also established that some of the tweets appeared to be rap lyrics. CNN's Ann O'Neill reported from Boston, and Mariano Castillo wrote in Atlanta.","highlights":"A police officer testifies about the writings Dzhokhar Tsarnaev scrawled on a boat .\nThe boat was Tsarnaev's final hideout before his arrest ."}
{"article":"Zafar Ansari and Mark Wood could be beneficiaries of the uncertainty around an England Test squad whose reputation has been left in tatters by the World Cup. Question marks remain over the fitness of Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes ahead of Wednesday\u2019s naming of the party for a three-Test series against the West Indies that Peter Moores desperately needs to win if he is to remain England coach. Moeen and Woakes were injured towards the end of England\u2019s disastrous World Cup campaign and are far from certain of being fit ahead of the first Test in Antigua on April 13 that follows two warm-up games in St Kitts. Zafar Ansari could be named as part of the England squad ahead of the three-Test series against West Indies . The 23-year-old is an all-rounder who bowls left-arm orthodox spin and opens the batting for Surrey . The 23-year-old Zafar Ansari is an all-rounder who bowls left-arm orthodox spin and opens the batting for Surrey. IS HE ANY GOOD? Just ask Kevin Pietersen! So often a victim of left-arm spin, the former England batsman was dismissed by a 19-year-old Ansari as Cambridge University beat Surrey by 10 wickets in 2011. Ansari has 54 first-class wickets and a batting average of 30.16. ANYTHING ELSE I NEED TO KNOW? Ansari would probably be among the smarter cricketers in England\u2019s tour party, having studied politics at Cambridge. He admits he is often ribbed by his team-mates for having a crossword out in the dressing room. That means Surrey\u2019s left-arm spin-bowling all-rounder Ansari and Durham pace bowler Wood could be named to travel with the squad as cover for Moeen and Woakes in the early days of the month-long tour. Ansari, 23, is predominantly a batsman and topped 1,000 championship runs last season but is perhaps the nearest equivalent to Moeen on the circuit. Wood impressed England\u2019s outgoing fast bowling coach David Saker during a training camp in South Africa before Christmas and only fitness concerns have held the 25-year-old back from full international recognition. It seems certain that Jonathan Trott, now returned to full fitness after leaving England\u2019s last Ashes tour with a condition later diagnosed as situational anxiety, will return after a successful tour of South Africa as Lions captain. England\u2019s Test middle order is settled following the success of Gary Ballance, Joe Root and Ian Bell in the three successive victories over India last summer, leaving Trott to battle Sam Robson to become Alastair Cook\u2019s opening partner. Mark Wood (centre) could also be included in England's test squad to face the West Indies . Question marks remain over the fitness of Moeen Ali (pictured) ahead of the Test series . Peter Moores desperately needs England to defeat the West Indies if he is to remain coach . Cook, sacked as one-day captain on the brink of the World Cup, returns to action for MCC against Yorkshire in Abu Dhabi starting on Sunday and will then seek to build on the progress made by England in Test cricket last summer. Jonny Bairstow, one of the casualties of the fall-out from the last Ashes, is favourite to tour as reserve wicketkeeper ahead of Kent\u2019s exciting Sam Billings, while Adil Rashid and James Tredwell will compete for the other spin place. Rashid, a more mature performer than when he was thrust into the England squad prematurely in 2009, looked a certainty to tour until he bowled poorly for the Lions in South Africa and may now be pipped by the more reliable Tredwell. Such is the desperate state of English cricket after the World Cup that the pressure will be on not just Moores but also managing director Paul Downton when England take on a West Indies side who look sure to be weakened by the Indian Premier League. Chris Gayle, for one, is likely to retire from international cricket after the World Cup and West Indies should be even more vulnerable than England.

Turf Moor was bouncing as Boyd lashed home a poor clearance from returning City captain Vincent Kompany after 61 minutes. And Manuel Pellegrini's men \u2013 who sent on \u00a350million substitutes Wilfried Bony and Stevan Jovetic to try and salvage the game \u2013 were lucky to survive with 11 men after bad challenges from Sergio Aguero and Martin Demichelis. CLICK HERE to read Sportsmail's Joe Bernstein's full match report from Turf Moor. Host commentator . What a potential season-defining moment Burnley's win could be tonight. The victory still sees the Clarets in the relegation zone - but by only one point with Sunderland looking over their shoulders ever-more. Meanwhile the defeat for City is damaging for their title hopes. A win for Chelsea on Sunday would see Manuel Pellegrini's side trail by eight points with nine games remaining. City now have to pick themselves up with a daunting trip to Barcelona in the Champions League on Wednesday night. Until next time, have a good evening! And the referee brings a close to the match. Relegation candidates Burnley have stunned the champions Manchester City! George Boyd's goal separates the two sides. Cue pandemonium among the Turf Moor faithful. 92 mins: Burnley make their second defensive change of the match as Danny Ings is taken off for Steven Reid. The hosts are now playing without any recognised strikers. 91 mins: Oh wow, what a huge moment in the match. Pablo Zabaleta charges into the Burnley box and falls under the challenge of Mee. On first inspection it looked a penalty and the replays suggest so too. However the referee decides otherwise and awards a free-kick to Burnley as Jason Shackell is fouled by Zabaleta during his tumble. The City players are incensed. Will that moment spell curtains for their title challenge? There will be four minutes of injury time to be added on... 86 mins: Burnley make their first change of the match and it's a defensive one as striker Sam Vokes is replaced by Stephen Ward. Lampard's appearance is his 600th in the Premier League. Only Ryan Giggs has made more. 82 mins: And that cross is Toure's last piece of action as he is replaced by Frank Lampard. 81 mins: What a chance that was for City to equalise. Navas cuts the ball back on the right flank to Yaya Toure. The latter whips in a devilish cross that finds the head of Aguero at the back post. The Argentina international can only head over from just outside the six-yard box though. The frustration grows for the visitors. City are continuing to press for an equaliser but have yet to breach the Burnley defence. As they push further forward gaps are starting to appear which Burnley are beginning to exploit. The visitors have simply not been at it tonight, a huge credit must go to the Clarets though. They've been brilliant. 74 mins: Pellegrini makes his second change of the match as Silva is replaced by Stevan Jovetic. 71 mins: Two of Burnley's back four are now cautioned as Michael Duff sees yellow for a foul. 66 mins: City have just over 20 minutes plus added time to turnaround this scoreline. Victory for City would see them close the gap on Chelsea to two-points ahead of their match against Southampton on Sunday. A defeat means the Blues could go eight points clear if they beat the Saints. Do the City players want it enough? 63 mins: City react to conceding the opener by taking off the ineffectual Dzeko and replacing him with Wilfried Bony. Demichelis' act of cynicism has been punished spectacularly by Burnley. From the resulting free-kick Trippier's set piece is headed away by City captain Vincent Kompany. Unfortunately for the defender his clearance falls straight to Boyd who hits a sweet left-footed volley first time that arrows into the bottom corner. A fantastic strike. 60 mins: Martin Demichelis swiftly follows Mee into the referees book for a cynical challenge on Ings. 58 mins: We have our first booking of the match and it's a harsh one as Ben Mee is cautioned for a challenge on Jesus Navas. Replays show it was a soft decision in comparison to some of the unpunished tackles that the City players have dealt. 55 mins:\u00a0What a hit by George Boyd - he's so unlucky. The Scotland international hits a hook volley, with his weaker right foot, over his shoulder that narrowly goes past the post. That's got the crowd engaged. 51 mins: David Silva has just produced a collectors item - a bad touch. And at precisely the wrong time too. Aguero does brilliantly to spin around a Burnley defender on the halfway line and race clear. With Silva in support he plays in the playmaker but his first touch forces him wide with Heaton bearing down on him. That could, and probably should have been, 1-0 to the visitors. Will the deadlock be broken in this stalemate? A Manchester City fan has just proposed to his Burnley-supporting girlfriend on the pitch at half time. Thankfully she said yes because it\u2019s a long walk back to the touchline. That\u2019s the best entertainment we\u2019ve had here so far. Disappointing first half from the champions. Surely they haven\u2019t got one eye on Barcelona when there\u2019s still something to play for in the title race. City showed a few flashes towards the end of the first half but Tom Heaton has only had two saves to make, and fairly routine saves at that. And the referee has drawn a close to first half proceedings at Turf Moor. In truth it's been a rather drab affair with no clear-cut chances yet created for either side. The hosts will be pleased with their display so far as they aim to avoid relegation, but City know they have to improve if they are to keep their hopes alive of retaining the Premier League title. 42 mins: City are dominating possession now and the stats support that with 70 per cent of the ball in their favour. However, the key statistic is that it is still 0-0. Can they make their dominance count? 34 mins: The visitors are slowly starting to come into the game more. Again Dzeko wriggles free inside in the Burnley box but is tackled before he can shoot. The ball falls into the path of Aguero who chooses to shoot rather the cross. The end product? An effort well wide of goal. Nevertheless a warning sign for the hosts. 29 mins: It's taken nearly half an hour but finally a keeper is forced into a save. Heaton comes off his line well to deny Dzeko from squeezing in a near post effort. From the resulting build-up the goalkeeper holds the ball well from an Aguero strike.\u00a0\u00a0As the old saying goes, you wait ages for a\u00a0bus\u00a0and then\u00a0two\u00a0come along at once. 26 mins: And that trend continues as Edin Dzeko drags an ambitious left-footed shot well wide of Tom Heaton's goal. 23 mins: The fans have little to cheer about so far and it's hardly surprising. We're approaching the midway point of the first half and neither side has managed a shot on target yet. 15 mins: Still no clear-cut chances created by either side. Both goalkeepers have had yet to break sweat. 10 mins: Burnley right back\u00a0Kieran Trippier crosses a ball that hits Gael Clichy. The home fans roar for a penalty but replays clearly show the ball hits the left back in the chest. 6 mins: As you would expect Burnley came out of the traps strongly in the opening exchanges. City have weathered that 'mini-storm' and are starting to express themselves. The match has started in Lancashire. Can Burnley stun City? Kick-off is imminent... Look away Burnley fans...\u00a0City are unbeaten in their last six visits to Turf Moor in all competitions, winning the last five in a row and scoring 17 times in the last four. To make matters the visitors\u00a0are unbeaten in their last 13 matches in all competitions against the Clarets (W8 D5 L0). Records are there to be broken though... In a close battle for the Premier League title, December 28 2014 could be a date that haunts City. Leading 2-0 at half-time against Burnley, Manuel Pellegrini's side squander a two-goal lead to draw with Sean Dyche's men. George Boyd scored straight after the break, turning home Danny Ings' shot while in an offside position. Then Ashley Barnes reacted quickest in a crowded penalty area to smash home a loose ball to earn the visitors a draw. Pellegrini knows his side can't afford a repeat performance like that if they are to close the gap on league leaders Chelsea. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany returns to the starting line-up after being an unused substitute against Leicester on 4 March. Quartet Pablo Zabaleta, Gael Clichy, Fernandinho and Edin Dzeko also start as Manuel Pellegrini rings the changes. Right so the Burnley team news is and\u00a0Mike Duff and Sam Vokes come in for Michael Keane and Michael Kightly in the only two changes for the Clarets\u00a0from the side that lost 2-0 at Anfield against Liverpool.

{"article":"Need some inspiration deciding who to back at Cheltenham? Sportsmail's Marcus Townend and Peter Scudamore reveal their favourites while\u00a0Sky Sports News HQ presenter Alex Hammond and other celebrities have also shared their tips for the Festival. PETER SCUDAMORE . PTIT ZIG . (JLT Novices\u2019 Chase, 1.30) I can forgive him his fall on his last run at Ascot \u2014 it was a typical novice mistake. But his form otherwise looks pretty strong and he can also boast some top quality Grade One-winning hurdle form. He is taken to fend off the strong Irish threat led by Apache Stronghold and Valseur Lido. BEST ODDS: 7-2 . Ptit Zig, pictured at the Christmas Meeting at Ascot, is Peter Scudamore's tip for the JLT Novices' Chase . DON COSSACK . (Ryanair Chase, 2.40) This gelding, trained by Gordon Elliott (below), looks a much more complete racehorse this season and has won all his four races since being beaten by AP McCoy\u2019s Gold Cup hope Carlingford Lough at the Punchestown Festival in April. He fell at this meeting last year but I would not hold that against him. Plus trainer Elliott already has a winner on the board with Cause of Causes on the first day. BEST ODDS: 3-1 . UN TEMPS POUR TOUT . (Ladbrokes World Hurdle, 3.20) An expensive recruit from France who has not yet quite reached the heights expected of him. He did, however, run a very promising first race of the season when third to Thursday\u2019s opponent Saphir Du Rheu in the Cleeve Hurdle in January. That was his first run since May so he is entitled to improve significantly and play a big part in a very open race. Confidence will be increased in his chance now that trainer David Pipe has had a winner at the meeting. BEST ODDS: 12-1 . BUYWISE . (Brown Advisory & Merriebell Stable Plate, 4.0) This Evan Williams-trained eight-year-old was an easy five length winner at Ffos Las on his last run and looks a horse who still has a little in hand with the handicapper. BEST ODDS: 7-1 . Buywise was an easy five length winner at Ffos Las and looks to have a little in hand with the handicapper . MARCUS TOWNEND . TRUSTAN TIMES . (Pertemps Hurdle, 2.05) Sybarite looks a good option here but, at even longer odds, this Tim Easterby-trained stayer looks worth a punt. He was fourth in the race 12 months ago, beaten less than half a length in a blanket finish, and he races off a marginally lower handicap mark this afternoon. His stable is in decent form with a couple of winners in its last six runners. BEST ODDS: 25-1 . EDUARD . (Ryanair Chase, 2.40) Lacks a little match practice for such a hotly-contested event as this but there is no doubt the Nicky Richards-trained gelding possesses talent. He would probably have beaten Wishfull Thinking, a rival again on Thursday, in the Peterborough Chase at Huntingdon last time but for an error at the final fence. BEST ODDS: 16-1 . COLE HARDEN . (Ladbrokes World Hurdle, 3.20) Has failed to win since his first race of the season at Wetherby at the start of November and could be regarded as disappointing. But the positives are that his stable has emerged from a quiet spell and he has had a breathing operation since being beaten behind Saphir Du Rheu here in January. Will be staying on better than most at the finish. BEST ODDS: 16-1 . Cole Harden has failed to win since his first race of the season at Wetherby at the start of November .

{"article":"(CNN)He's a Rolls Royce footballer who honed his game in his parents' garage. And even at the age of 40, former Juventus star Alessandro Del Piero is still purring along, showing no signs of running out of gas. The record-breaking striker is currently enjoying an Indian summer to his football career, completing stints at Sydney FC in Australia and more recently at the Delhi Dynamos in the inaugural Indian Super League. Inevitably, the time will come when he finally decides to hang up his boots but that doesn't look like happening anytime soon -- not when he's still enjoying himself so much. \"About football, I love every single moment -- the life with teammates, the atmosphere before a game, the free kicks, the goals. I love every moment like the first one,\" Del Piero told CNN's Human to Hero series. The man dubbed \"Il Pinturicchio\" (\"the little artist\") has enjoyed a glittering career for both country and club in Italy. During 19 seasons at Juventus he won 15 trophies including six Serie A crowns and a European Champions League title, as well as setting club records for appearances and goals. In all, Del Piero made 705 appearances for the Bianconeri -- including a record 478 in Serie A -- and scored 289 goals along the way. \"I'm very proud about the records because I do everything for the club. I've had some great moments with the club, with the fans (and) with my teammates,\" he says. Raised in the town of Conegliano in northern Italy, Del Piero's love for football was fostered by his late father, Gino. \"My childhood was fantastic. I trained and played every moment and in every space of my home,\" he recalls. \"You know northern Italy is very cold -- you cannot play outside, so my father would move the car out of the garage to give me more space. I would play alone, with my schoolmates and try to imagine in my mind what it means to be a footballer.\" Del Piero turned professional at the age of 17, joining Serie B side Padova in 1991 before being snapped up by Juventus for \u20ac2.6 million two years later. His longstanding relationship with the \"Old Lady,\" as Juventus is affectionately known, got off on the right foot almost from the start. Del Piero scored five times in 11 appearances in his debut season before making his breakthrough the following year, becoming a first-team regular standing in for injured star striker Roberto Baggio. The two men would go on to share a dressing room at international level, with both netting 27 times for their country, but their defining moments for the Azzurri could not have been more contrasting. While Baggio will forever be remembered for missing a penalty kick that handed Brazil victory in the 1994 FIFA World Cup final, Del Piero has cause to reflect on happier times on football's biggest stage. After being part of two unsuccessful campaigns in 1998 and 2002, Del Piero and Italy hit the jackpot in 2006 in Germany, beating France on penalties in a final remembered primarily for Zinedine Zidane's headbutt on Italy defender Marco Materazzi. Victory in the final was a \"beautiful\" moment but Del Piero's most cherished memory of that tournament happened a few days earlier. \"The most special moment in my head, and probably the heads of my teammates, was the semifinal,\" he says. \"Definitely the final, when you take the cup and lift it to the sky, it's beautiful. But the semifinal was the most exciting. We played the home team for 120 minutes. There is a big connection between our two countries. It was incredible.\" An epic battle looked to be heading for penalties after a goalless 90 minutes, with extra time going the same way, before Fabio Grosso netted in the 119th minute followed by a Del Piero effort moments later. \"I can't hide that my greatest victory is the World Cup. Since you're a kid you think you want to win that. It was massive,\" he says. Italy's third World Cup triumph came against a backdrop of turmoil in Italy's domestic league as Juventus and other Serie A teams were implicated in the \"Calciopoli\" match-fixing scandal. The repercussions would see former Juventus managing director Luciano Moggi banned for life by the Italian football authorities while the club was stripped of two Serie A titles won in 2005 and 2006, relegated to Serie B and docked nine points. The demotion to Italy's second tier saw some top players leave the club, including Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro, France defender Lilian Thuram and Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. But the ever-faithful Del Piero stayed put, helping Juventus secure the Serie B title and an immediate return to the top flight. \"I think that staying with Juventus in Serie B, even before I knew how large the points penalty was going to be, was the best decision I could've made,\" Del Piero said last year. \"I had an extraordinary season that gave extra meaning to everything that came afterwards, including the (Serie A) trophy I lifted on the last game at the Juventus Stadium.\" Del Piero also scored in that final league match against Atalanta in May 2012 and was afforded a hero's send-off with a 20-minute standing ovation after his substitution in the second half. \"There were many people crying that day. I was very emotional. I tried to hide my tears by bowing down to pick up some scarfs and cleaning my eyes. It was a very special and touching moment ... it will stay with me forever,\" he recalls. A open letter to Juventus' fans confirmed his exit the following July before signing a two-year deal to play for Sydney FC in Australia's A-League in a deal worth AUS$4 million ($3 million). He was soon helping repay that fee, netting a trademark free kick on his home debut -- one of 24 goals scored during his time Down Under. Del Piero has since gone on to help promote the new Indian Super League, appearing in the inaugural competition late last year. So what plans does the veteran have for 2015? \"My future plan is to find a good restaurant tonight and have a rest and then tomorrow is another day,\" he says cheekily before suggesting that his playing days may not be over just yet. \"I have two or three situations to analyze. I want to take some time to make a good decision like I did in the past,\" he adds. \"I would love to play again, I want to play with good people around me. I'm still training now -- I want to keep myself ready for a big decision.\" Watch this space.","highlights":"Former Juventus star still enjoying football into his 40s .\nItalian striker has enjoyed stints at Sydney FC and Delhi Dynamos .\nRecord scorer for Juventus considering offers to carry on playing .\nThe 2006 World Cup winner says semifinal against Germany was most exciting game ."}
{"article":"(CNN)American missionary Phyllis Sortor, who was kidnapped last month by masked gunmen in central Nigeria, has been freed, a U.S. official confirmed Friday. Officials refused to provide details of her release, but said it involved some form of negotiations. Five men abducted Sortor, a missionary from Seattle with the Free Methodist Church, from her workplace February 23 and demanded a ransom of 60 million Naira ($301,500), Kogi state police Commissioner Adeyemi Ogunjemilusi said. Sortor runs a nongovernmental organization that educates nomadic Fulani children, the police commissioner said. Kogi state is located away from the areas where Boko Haram operates, making it likely that the kidnapping is not related to them. But there is the possibility that an offshoot group could have kidnapped Sortor, or that she might be sold to another group.","highlights":"American missionary Phyllis Sortor was kidnapped by masked gunmen in central Nigeria on February 23 .\nSortor, who was affiliated with the Free Methodist Church, has been released, an official said Friday ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Farah fled the civil war in Syria with her husband in the middle of the night, hitching rides on trucks until they finally crossed into Jordan. Two days later, she gave birth to a girl in a country where they hold no status. Like 70,000 other refugees from Syria, Iraq, Sudan and the Palestinian Territories, Farah (her name and the others in this article have been changed to protect their anonymity) now lives with her family in Zarqa, a poor Jordanian city teeming with factories and crumbling apartment blocks. Men dominate public spaces, and many women stay at home, isolated. Two years ago, Farah was a nurse and her husband a lawyer. Here, he found work tiling construction sites, but was arrested three times for working illegally. \"Now my husband stays at home, depressed and afraid of being sent to the camps,\" Farah said. She is now the family breadwinner, working at a local organization providing educational programs to Syrian and Jordanian children. Every day she navigates the dangers of Zarqa's crime-ridden streets and ignores sexual advances from men. Yet Zarqa is also a pocket of hope. Some 384 female refugees working with the Near East Foundation  have been able to re-establish savings, restore dignity, strengthen their capacity to bounce back and rebuild their lives. Many of them choose to become earners for the first time. They belong to a network of Jordanian and refugee women -- coaches, mentors and peers -- who lean on each other and offer business and social support, exchange tips and build friendships. Some 80% of the refugees in this network have chosen to invest in building a small home-based business. Fatiya, who escaped Iraq during the 2003 invasion, was surviving on charity until six months ago. Now she runs her own leather goods home-based business, making belts, wallets and key chains for tourists from the safety of her home. These days, Fatiya is busy rebuilding her life. \"I make my own way,\"she says. Zainab, also an Iraqi refugee, is now a hairdresser in Zarqa. On the side, she teaches the art of hairdressing to young women, walking alongside them in their first steps to become economically independent. On March 8, we celebrate International Women's Day and the empowerment of women globally -- including the nearly 6 million refugee women and girls who, like Farah, Fatiya and Zainab, continue to adapt to life in their new surroundings with determination, creativity and skill, despite increasingly limited options. Aid agencies must match the strength of these women's resilience. To truly assist them, we must empower them with opportunities and choices. Of the 10.5 million refugees registered with UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, less than 1% are eventually resettled. The rest remain in limbo, forced to forge new lives in places where they often have no right to work. Refugees are displaced for an average of 20 years, and more than half disappear into urban sprawls where they struggle to integrate and start their lives over. Humanitarian assistance and media attention tend to fixate on \"immediate\" aid -- distribution of cash, food and subsistence items. This is unsustainable. UNHCR provides critical cash assistance to refugees in Jordan -- but this can be as little as $71 a month, 16 times below the country's poverty line. Refugees need to supplement their allowances, yet they cannot legally find employment, and working in the informal sector can be dangerous. Farah, Fatiya and Zainab are among hundreds of women who are finding a world of options as they build their vocational skills and financial literacy. But their increased role as earners challenges cultural norms, exposing them to heightened abuse and violence. Women's ability to generate income does not guarantee economic independence. To help this network of women control the income they earn, the Near East Foundation facilitates discussions with male family members about their wives' and daughters' newfound roles. \"In the beginning, these women were tremendously shy -- they didn't talk,\" says Hamdan Eliemat, who heads the Bani Hasan Islamic Society, a community organization supporting the women. He laughs. \"And now they won't stop talking. And we men, now we have to listen.\" The international community must advocate for refugees' right to survive. We must ensure that beyond immediate aid, women have access to skill-building, financial resources, social networks and protection from violence and harassment, so they have the chance to build their own futures.","highlights":"Jina Krause-Vilmar: On International Women's Day, focus on helping refugee women adapt to new lives .\nShe says aid agencies like hers aim to help these women build job skills and financial literacy .\nShe says the effort includes educating men about wives' and daughters' new roles ."}
{"article":"England went back to work on Friday at Adelaide\u2019s St Peter\u2019s College, alma mater of 10 Australian Prime Ministers and one of the country\u2019s great schools, but there was no way they could relax and enjoy the splendour of their surroundings. Elimination at the group stages of this World Cup is just one slip-up or even one rainy day away for England, who seem to have been wading through treacle while the rest of the world have been playing a different, far more vibrant, one-day game. Now England must beat Bangladesh and Afghanistan in their final Group A games and hope New Zealand also defeat Bangladesh, while keeping their fingers crossed that the elements do not intervene. Jos Buttler has warned England that they cannot afford any more slip-ups \u00a0if they are to avoid elimination . Buttler catches the ball during an England nets session at St Peter's College in Adelaide . Buttler plays a shot during an England nets session as they prepare for the game against Afghanistan . India sealed a place in the World Cup knockout stages after a nervy run chase against West Indies in Perth. The defending champions bowled West Indies out for 182 in 44.2 overs, captain Jason Holder top-scoring with 57 at No 9. India\u2019s task was made harder by an up-and-down wicket at the WACA, but 45 not out from MS Dhoni saw them reach their target with four wickets and 10.5 overs to spare. \u2018It was a difficult wicket, with variable bounce,\u2019 said Dhoni. \u2018Overall, I was very happy with the performance.\u2019 England have endured some rotten World Cups but to go out in the first round of a competition designed to guarantee progress for the big eight would make this the worst yet. But the way they have been playing, not even victory against the two minnows can be taken for granted. Defeat by Bangladesh at the Adelaide Oval on Monday would pile pressure on coach Peter Moores and Paul Downton, who appointed him, when a new broom is sweeping through the ECB. To think that the Ashes were moved and we had to endure a 5-0 thrashing so that this team could have unprecedented one-day preparation for a World Cup. There was a subdued air on Friday with only the St Peter\u2019s pupils chosen to supplement the fielders during middle practice having a spring in their step. England were criticised for changing their line-up on the eve of this World Cup but they would be stubborn in the extreme if they did not shuffle their pack now. Trouble is, Alex Hales looked in terrible touch both in the middle against England\u2019s bowlers and later in a net.

Whatever we do we have to post big scores and do it consistently.\u2019 England\u2019s bowlers are under just as much pressure as the batsmen after the way Sri Lanka cruised home in Wellington and it would be no surprise if James Tredwell, who had a long bowl on Friday, comes in against Bangladesh.

{"article":"(CNN)British military advisers are training Ukrainian troops in Ukraine, the UK said Thursday, as part of efforts to support the government in Kiev as it combats pro-Russian separatists in the east. Prime Minister David Cameron announced last month that Britain would send military advisers to Ukraine and provide an additional 15 million pounds ($22.3 million) in humanitarian aid. An uneasy truce has been in place since last month between the Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Last month, UK Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told Parliament that Britain was \"providing additional nonlethal support\" in the form of advisory and training teams. \"This support, provided at the request of the Ukrainian government, will help their armed forces develop and maintain the capacity and resilience they need, and help reduce fatalities and casualties,\" Fallon said. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has been monitoring the ceasefire, said Wednesday that its observers had witnessed continued fighting in areas around Donetsk airport and Shyrokyne, east of the port city of Mariupol. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the presence of foreign military instructors in Ukraine did nothing to reduce tensions, Russian state news agency Sputnik reported. \"Obviously, this is not helping in the building of trust or in easing the tensions in the conflict. It can be simply said that this is not aiding in the settlement, that's a fact,\" Peskov is quoted as saying. The United States has promised to support an upcoming training program for Ukraine's National Guard forces. Russia is under continued pressure from the West to end its support for the separatists. Moscow denies claims by Kiev and the West that it has trained and equipped the rebels, as well as sending Russian troops to fight alongside them. In what Kremlin observers may see as another sign of defiance, Russia signed a treaty Wednesday with Georgia's breakaway territory of South Ossetia. Russia sent its tanks into Georgia in 2008 and subsequently encouraged separatists in its South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions to declare independence from Tbilisi. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg condemned the \"so-called treaty on alliance and integration\" in a statement Wednesday, and repeated NATO's call for Russia to reverse its recognition of the territories as independent states and to withdraw its forces from Georgian soil. \"This so-called treaty is yet another move by the Russian Federation that hampers ongoing efforts by the international community to strengthen security and stability in the region,\" he said. \"It violates Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and blatantly contradicts the principles of international law, OSCE principles and Russia's international commitments. \"It does not contribute to a peaceful and lasting settlement of the situation in Georgia.\" CNN's Vasco Cotovio and Alla Eshchenko contributed to this report.","highlights":"UK will also provide an additional $22.4 million in humanitarian aid .\nRussia signs a treaty with Georgia's breakaway South Ossetia region ."}
{"article":"Sunderland's Steven Fletcher has been blasted by fans after posing with his new \u00a3260,000 Lamborghini Aventador supercar while struggling for goals during the club's relegation battle. The \u00a340,000-a-week striker, who has scored just seven times in two years for Sunderland, suffered a Twitter backlash after the photograph of him with the supercar on the driveway of his home went viral. The 27-year-old player, who cost his club \u00a312million, was criticised by fans who said the car was \u2018undeserved\u2019 and the timing of the photo was \u2018really appalling\u2019, after it began circulating three days before his team lost 4-0. Aventador: Steven Fletcher, who has scored just seven times in two years for Sunderland, suffered a Twitter backlash after the photograph of him with the supercar on the driveway of his home went viral . Partner: Fletcher is pictured with his beauty queen girlfriend Rachel Monaghan, 22 . However, his agent Scott Fisher told the Daily Record that Fletcher had not put the image on Twitter - adding that it was the company who sold the supercar who posted the picture online. Mr Fisher said: \u2018It wasn\u2019t Steven that put the picture up. The company who were doing advertising on it done it. I don\u2019t know what the problem is and what people are getting excited about.\u2019 But Janet Rowan, from the Sunderland Supporters\u2019 Association, said that \u2018it was probably the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u2019 for low-income fans to see someone taking possession of such a car. She told the Daily Mirror: \u2018We know footballers have these big flash cars. I just think the timing was really appalling and I can really understand the way that people have felt about this.\u2019 The four-wheel drive Aventador, which sells for between \u00a3242,000 and \u00a3295,000, has a top speed of 217mph, will return 17.6mpg and can perform 0 to 62mph in 2.9 seconds. Seven goals in two seasons: Fletcher (left) vies for the ball with Aston Villa's Jores Okore (right) during his Sunderland side's 4-0 Premier League defeat at the Stadium of Light on March 14 . Comparisons: Birmingham fan Michael Jabbari quoted a message from parody account BBC Sporf in a tweet, which said: 'Steven Fletcher: two seasons, seven goals, one new Lamborghini Aventador' In response to the photo, Sunderland fan JamesTheMackem posted on Twitter: 'Steven Fletcher has a Lamborghini, the most undeserved Lambo for a football player, ever.' Jack Liddell added: 'Tell me how Steven Fletcher (a striker) can score seven goals in two seasons yet have earned a Lamborghini Aventador and a Bentley Continental.' Fletcher began his career at Hibernian in 2004, before moving to Burnley for \u00a33million in 2009, Wolverhampton Wanderers for \u00a36.5million in 2010, and Sunderland for \u00a312million in 2012. But while he scored 52 goals in five years for Hibernian, 12 in one year for Burnley and 24 in two years for Wolves, he has struggled for form at Sunderland since signing. Fletcher scored 11 goals in his first season for the Black Cats, but only netted three last term - and has managed four this campaign. He has also played 18 times for Scotland, scoring once. Unimpressed: In response to the photo, Sunderland fan JamesTheMackem posted on Twitter that it was 'the most undeserved Lambo for a football player, ever' Disbelief: One football fan, John Tough, said he 'can't get over the fact' that Fletcher is driving a Lamborghini . Mystified: Jack Liddell posted a similar comment, wondering how Fletcher has 'earned a Lamborghini Aventador and a Bentley Continental' Sunderland sacked boss Gus Poyet last week after the 4-0 defeat to Aston Villa, before his replacement Dick Advocaat led the team to a 1-0 defeat at West Ham United on Saturday. The club are now in 17th, one place and one point above the relegation zone, with their next fixture against Newcastle United in the 152nd Tyne-Wear derby this Sunday. Fletcher, who was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, spent his younger years at military bases as the son of soldier Kenny, before he died aged 38 after a battle with cancer. This occurred when Fletcher was just ten, which saw his mother Mary move them to Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, to be closer to her family. After he had left home, she moved to County Durham and has lived there with his stepfather Martin, a Sunderland fan, for more than a decade. Fletcher moved to a \u00a3670,000 five-bedroom home in County Durham with his beauty queen partner Rachel Monaghan, 22, in October 2013, and they live there with their daughter Darcy-Mae, one.","highlights":"Steven Fletcher has scored just seven times in two years for Sunderland .\nSuffered Twitter backlash after photo of him with supercar went viral .\nFans say car is 'undeserved' and timing of photo was 'really appalling'\nBegan circulating three days before his struggling team lost 4-0 at home .\nBut agent  says company who sold Aventador posted the image online ."}
{"article":"(CNN)This is what it's come to. Starbucks asked its local baristas to have conversations about race. Not the federal government or Congress. Not academia or the NAACP. But a national coffee shop chain waded into an area of social conflict that is as old as the slave ships and as modern as stop-and-frisk policing. Then people went crazy. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz was accused of ruining that magic morning moment when customers fork over $4.15  for a \"grande\" coffee with warm skim milk and vanilla extract. A barista writing \"Race Together\" on cups was called an affront to mornings and coffee -- such important conversations belonged inside a hallowed institution, not a common coffee shop, where apparently people no longer chat. A lot of the reaction came via snipes on Twitter from people calling Schultz out on Starbucks' diversity, the hue of his mochaccinos, or his liberal \"brewing\" of controversy.  The nastiness drove the company's communications chief briefly off Twitter. Then, after barely a week, Starbucks shut down the whole darned thing, pushing ahead with a hiring and media initiative instead. But treating Twitter as an important voice of American conscience is like focusing on the annoying beep emitting from your smoke detector instead of addressing the fact that the battery's run dry. What's trending is not necessarily what matters. People do need to talk about race. Not because of a harmless coffee cup, but because we have a real race problem and we need solutions. Starfish Media Group just finished a nationwide tour of American colleges, universities and communities called \"Black in America 2015.\" It's based on our CNN documentary series that takes a close look at the challenges and triumphs of being black in America: from the hopes of the Martin Luther King era to today's unlikely brew of un-kept promises and vast opportunities. There were plenty of conversations about race among the thousands of black and white college students and panelists like rapper Chuck D and Cedric Alexander of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives. They lined up to talk about how their experiences mirrored those of the people in the documentaries: black families finding common roots with whites, the politics of skin color, or the black-and-blue conflict over the police engaging in racial profiling. The topics and perceptions were an unending thread. Not only did people talk when they were offered the chance; they wanted to talk. At Stony Brook University, one of our tour stops, a young white male student asked our panel if effecting change in racial discrimination today was even harder to achieve than it was during the Civil Rights era when racism was more overt.  What a good question. There are no longer signs segregating our bathrooms and water fountains, but police are being caught on cell phone videos in apparent attacks on young black men -- the new signposts of racial inequality. New technology has multiplied and spread symbols of racial injustice, but that has created new challenges and new reasons to talk. In this country we sometimes pretend we are so far past the ugly days of Jim Crow and middle-of-the-night cross burnings as to have no racial issues to discuss. We did, after all, elect a black president who, like me, has both a black and a white parent and descends from immigrants. But blacks and whites don't see things the same, and that is a big problem we need to discuss. Pew Research Center asked people of both races this year how much more needs to be done to achieve racial equality. Seventy-nine percent of blacks said \"a lot\" more work needs to be done. Just 44% of whites thought the same. Our country is more diverse than ever -- 13% African-American and 17% Latino, according to the U.S. Census -- but we still live in different worlds.  Blacks have more debt, higher unemployment, less financial security, are less likely to be married or own homes, and are less likely to be represented in corporate boardrooms, the tech industry or even Congress. Perhaps more alarmingly, 75% of black students are going to schools where the majority of the students look just like them. It has been 60 years since Brown v. Board of Education was supposed to bring our schoolchildren together on an equal playing field. That is something worth talking about. Recently, Bryan Stevenson, who founded the Equal Justice Initiative in Montgomery, Alabama, examined the details behind 3,959 lynchings in 12 Southern states from 1877 to 1950. He wants to raise money to memorialize the sites. We may not live in that land any more, though the FBI is investigating the death of a black man found hanging among the walnut trees this month in Mississippi. But we do live in a land where there is a modern terror digging roots in the minds of young black men. In 2014, our CNN documentary \"Black in America: Black & Blue\" showed police officers talking fearfully about facing off against young criminals on familiar streets and African-American men in fear that they would become the victims of police shootings. The documentary was released just as grand juries chose not to indict the police officers in the Eric Garner and Ferguson, Missouri, cases. To me, it reveals how damaging the rift in our perceptions can be. A young man named Keeshan Harley talked about being frisked over 100 times. Why? \"Because I fit the description,\" said the black college student. Seventy percent of blacks believe, just like Keeshan, that the police treat racial and ethnic groups differently and do not hold police officers accountable for misconduct, according to a study by the Pew Research Center. The percentage of whites who agree with that perception hovers in the mid-30s. Much of the white community doesn't perceive or understand the persecution of a Keeshan Harley. But when they see a videotape, as in the Eric Garner case, many finally recognize there is a problem. We need to consider how a lack of confidence in government and law enforcement is dangerous in a civil society. A young man named Luis Paulino shared a cell phone video with me when I was reporting \"Black & Blue.\" It shows tall white police officers beating Luis on the street for no apparent reason. He couldn't call the police for help. These were the police. What if there had been no tape, I asked him. \"Nobody would have believed me,\" he said. \"It would have been my word against 15 police officers.\" That is modern-day terror, and worth at least a coffee shop chat. Black people talk about race all the time, from processing comments about our freckles to recounting how someone rolls their fingers through our child's curly hair. We don't get or expect an even playing field at work. We don't ever get to cross a street in a hoodie at night without the other pedestrians making a string of assumptions. We don't have some mutable characteristic. We wake up and go to bed black, and that makes a difference in this country. CEO Howard Schultz was left wondering why it was such a bad idea to encourage people to talk about race. His initial letter to his staff made it clear he believes his #racetogether coffee cup campaign can contribute to starting an important conversation. \"What if our customers ... had a renewed level of understanding and sensitivity about the issue, and they themselves would spread that to their own sphere of influence?\" What a good question it was. What if?","highlights":"Starbucks quickly shut down its program of asking baristas to talk to the public about race .\nSoledad O'Brien: Forget the storm of tweets criticizing the coffee company; we need a vigorous conversation on race ."}
{"article":"(CNN)My vote for Father of the Year goes to Curt Schilling. The former Major League Baseball pitcher recently fired off a series of fastballs and mowed down a group of Twitter trolls who made the mistake of tweeting vulgar and sexually-explicit comments about Schilling's teenage daughter. The drama started, innocently enough, on February 25, when Schilling played the role of a proud father. He sent a tweet congratulating his daughter, Gabby, on being accepted to Salve Regina University, where she'll play softball. It read: \"Congrats to Gabby Schilling who will pitch for the Salve Regina Seahawks next year!! \u2014 Curt Schilling (@gehrig38)\" Almost immediately, responses came in from young men, complete strangers who apparently followed Schilling on Twitter. The tweets quickly went from immature, to creepy, to repugnant. Threats of rape were common. The tweets were deleted, and the accounts were closed after this story went viral. But not before Schilling captured some of the images and posted them on his blog. What was said about 17-year-old Gabby Schilling wasn't just obnoxious. It was vile and obscene. What was said wasn't just mean and ugly. It was threatening and scary. As a parent, it's the kind of thing that makes you rethink your opposition to public caning as a logical punishment for such transgressions. These misogynistic cowards may have thought they could hide in the darkness of anonymity, the sort that many have come to expect from social media sites, where you feel free to be a  despicable human being because, you think, no one will ever find out who you really are and hold you accountable for your words. If so, they thought wrong. They couldn't hide. They were found out, and they got the throttling they so richly deserved. Thanks to dad. According to Schilling, who made it his mission to track down these cretins and make sure those they associate with know who they really are, two people have already paid a price due to their tweets. One was a student disc jockey at a community college in New Jersey, who was suspended, and the other was a part-time ticket seller for the New York Yankees, who was fired. Concerned that this is an example of exactly the kind of cyberbullying that leads some teenagers to commit suicide, Schilling is also thinking about taking legal action against some of the other people involved. Bravo for him. I'm sure that, all across America, dads with daughters -- after reading some of the horrible things that were said about this young girl -- are marveling at Schilling's self-control. I have two daughters of my own, and he's a better man than me. If ever there was a case where profanity-spewing malcontents deserved to have their mouths washed out with soap, this is it. So what additional insights can we draw, and what larger lessons can we learn, from this unexpected but predictable collision of old-fashioned parenthood and newfangled media? There are a few. The first is about accountability, the very thing that the young men who posted these hurtful messages were trying to avoid. But Schilling wouldn't let them. At their best, social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and others allow the sharing the information and the building of a sense of community. At their worst, they become digital sandboxes and locker rooms where people think have a license to misbehave without having to worry about consequences. We need to applaud efforts like this that promote greater online accountability. There's also something to be said about protective parents, and how essential they are to a working society. We should still be concerned about those overprotective parents who hover like helicopters from little league to job interviews. We shouldn't bubblewrap our kids, and keep them from playing outdoors, and then sit around wondering why they're soft, timid, and risk-averse. But protective parents -- the kind who shield their kids from real danger -- never go out of style. A parent's top job is to protect his children. Schilling did his job. Finally, it's worth reminding everyone that freedom of expression does not mean freedom from rules, standards, and expectations that should guide your behavior. There are things you don't say. There are boundaries, ways that we expect you to behave so you don't terrorize other people or bring shame upon yourself, your friends, and your family. If you don't have social skills, you don't belong on social media. The tweets make you wince. But in this story, you'll still find plenty to smile about. This whole drama unfolded because Schilling was proud of his daughter. Now, given how he reacted, we all have reason to be proud of him. \u200b .","highlights":"Ruben Navarrette: Schilling deserves praise for taking on online haters for offensive comments about his daughter .\nNavarrette: In protecting his child, Schilling set a model for parenting and taught us a lesson about social media ."}
{"article":"The new Formula One season gets underway in the early hours of Sunday morning when Melbourne plays host to the opening race of the campaign. Ahead of the curtain raiser, Phil Duncan assesses the sport's hot topics... So, it looks like Lewis Hamilton is going to waltz to back-to-back titles\u2026 . There\u2019s no question that Mercedes are set to pick up in 2015 where they left off last year. Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg clocked up more miles than any of their rivals over the winter, and they were the quickest, too. Hamilton won 11 of the 19 races last year, and you fancy if he sorts out his performances in qualifying, he\u2019ll be tough to beat. Lewis Hamilton appeared in a relaxed mood as he signed autographs for punters ahead of the season opener . Hamilton\u2019s popped up at a host of celeb parties over the winter\u2026 Is there any danger he\u2019s taken his eye off the ball? The reigning champion has helped to raise F1\u2019s profile away from the track after attending a number of showbiz functions during the off-season. From the Paris catwalk to the red carpet at the BRITs, Hamilton's never been far from the limelight. His high-profile split from Nicole Scherzinger has hit the headlines, too. But the Briton, now somewhat of the elder statesman on the grid having celebrated his 30th birthday at the turn of the year, appears to have adopted a new-found maturity in recent times, and his desire to match Ayrton Senna\u2019s feat of three world titles appears to be his sole focus heading into the new campaign. At least, he's telling us that anyway. Hamilton poses in his Mercedes overalls on Thursday as he prepares to defend his world championship . Rosberg, posing for pictures with fans on Thursday, will renew his title battle with team-mate Hamilton . So, what can Rosberg do to stop him? Rosberg out-qualified Hamilton 12-7 last term, but his race displays left much to be desired; indeed he converted just three of his 11 poles into victories in 2014. If the German sorts out his race pace, he\u2019ll give Hamilton a run for his money. At 3-1 with some bookmakers, he\u2019s certainly worth a punt. And what about the rest of the grid? Williams, powered by Mercedes once more, are set to be Hamilton and Rosberg\u2019s nearest challengers. Valtteri Bottas was one of the stand-out performers last term, and his team-mate Felipe Massa is among the most experienced out there. Ferrari, boosted by the arrival of Sebastian Vettel from Red Bull, have seemingly turned a corner in pre-season testing and look primed to bounce back from two years in the doldrums. Daniel Ricciardo, the only non-Mercedes driver to win a race last year, should be confident after a number of impressive displays in 2014, but his Renault-powered Red Bull still lacks what it takes to challenge Hamilton and Rosberg on a consistent basis. Williams driver Valtteri Bottas was among the stand-out performers in 2014, and he is set to take the challenge to Mercedes once more . Daniel Ricciardo poses with models at the Albert Park Circuit ahead of his home race in Melbourne . I noticed you haven\u2019t mentioned McLaren\u2026 I thought they were going to be back at the front after renewing their partnership with Honda? Well, that was the plan, but it looks as though it will be some time before either Fernando Alonso or Jenson Button get a sniff of the podium let alone win a race. The Woking-based outfit, struck by a host of reliability issues managed fewer miles than any other team in testing and they were well off the pace, too. Button, retained by McLaren after a surprise U-turn from the team's hierarchy at the end of last year, has already called for patience, and reckons just getting to the finish on Sunday, should be considered a positive result. Jenson Button is set for his 16th season in Formula One, but McLaren are likely to struggle from the offset . And Alonso, their marque signing, won't be there? No. The Spaniard suffered a mysterious crash in testing which left him concussed and in hospital for three days. CCTV captured the 134mph smash, but the footage \u00a0has never been released adding to the mystery surrounding the incident. The former Ferrari man is confident he will back for the second race in Malaysia, but his participation is yet to be confirmed by McLaren. Kevin Magnussen, dropped by the British team at the end of last year, gets his chance in Melbourne this weekend. Fernando Alonso waves to the media after he is released from hospital following a crash in testing . With a combined age of 68, Alonso and Button form the eldest pairing on the grid, but what about this kid Verstappen? He isn\u2019t old enough to drive a road car yet is he? Not in his native Holland, no. Son of Jos Verstappen, the former Benetton driver and team-mate of Michael Schumacher, Max is just 17. He has been partnered at Red Bull's junior team Toro Rosso with rookie Carlos Sainz Jnr, who at the grand old age of 20 is somewhat of a veteran. Verstappen will become the youngest driver in F1 history on Sunday, and it\u2019s a record which is unlikely to be broken after the FIA raised the minimum age limit to 18 in the wake of Verstappen\u2019s controversial appointment. Max Verstappen (left) and Carlos Sainz Jnr will form the youngest driver pairing in grand prix history . So, what else do I need to look out for this season? Following one of the grandest overhauls of the sport ahead of the last campaign, the rules and regulations are relatively unchanged for 2015. Ugly nosecones are thankfully a thing of the past, the Mexican Grand Prix is back on the calendar for the first time in more than two decades, and drivers have been stopped from changing their helmet throughout the season. Caterham are gone, but Marussia, now in the guise of Manor, have survived and after hiring Will Stevens, three Brits will line up Down Under. We\u2019ll also see the introduction of the \u2018Virtual Safety Car\u2019... Under new regulations, Hamilton will be forced to stick with the same helmet design (above) throughout 2015 . What\u2019s that all about then? In the wake of Jules Bianchi's horror crash at last year's Japanese Grand Prix, a 'Virtual Safety Car; concept has been introduced. FIA race director Charlie Whiting will deploy the system immediately after any incident which requires double waved yellows, but is not deemed severe enough for the Safety Car itself. The aim is to neutralise the race track and slow drivers down after Bianchi, who remains unconscious in hospital, was adjudged to have been going too fast when he crashed into the back of a tractor sent to recover Adrian Sutil\u2019s Sauber at the rain-lashed race in Japan. So, what time shall I set my alarm for on Sunday? Nice and early! Another recommendation following Bianchi\u2019s crash was to bring forward the start-time of a number of races outside Europe. Sunday's Australian Grand Prix gets underway at 5am (4pm local time), one hour earlier than last year, to avoid any danger of the race ending in darkness.\u00a0You can follow the coverage of every lap on\u00a0MailOnline.

{"article":"(CNN)If the 20th century was the century of the skyscraper, then the 21st century is shaping up as the century of the \"plyscaper.\" Despite its historical reputation for great city fires -- London in 1666, the Great Chicago fire of 1871 and San Francisco in 1906 -- wood is making a comeback as a construction material. Next year in Vienna, construction will begin on a 275-foot building made almost entirely of wood, while Stockholm may build a 34-story wooden apartment by 2023. Others are in the pipeline from Canada to Australia to Europe. With faster construction times and a softer environmental impact, could the building material of the past be the future of construction? Vancouver-based architect Michael Green says the momentum is gaining as new engineered woods allow for greater strength and heights in buildings. His firm MGA recently completed a 29.5m (97 feet) wooden building, the Wood Innovation and Design Center in Prince George, Northern British Columbia. But he said news of taller wooden structures is sprouting up all the time. \"There seems to be a new announcement every two or  three weeks,\" Green said. \"We've got one in Vancouver for 18 stories and in Vienna there's one for more than 20 stories. \"We've done research in high earthquake zones that show 30 stories is feasible; we certainly think we can go to 40 and higher.\" He said new developments in engineered woods -- small wood components that are glued together to make large panels for building -- are a game-changer for construction. Mass timber panels, in particular, cross-laminated timber (known in the industry simply as CLT) are becoming established as a quicker, greener and eventually cheaper alternative to concrete and steel. One great bonus of the material is the speed of construction; panels can be made to measure in the factory complete with openings, windows and doors. While the main advantages of working in wood are manifold -- it's flexible, robust and easily worked -- Green says wood may be the only material to address the growing problems of urbanization. \"Wood has not been an urban material so we looked at how it could be a contributor to urban environments,\" he said. \"There are a whole host of advantages. \"Steel and concrete have huge carbon footprints. Concrete accounts for about 6-8% of man's greenhouse gas emissions, whereas wood stores carbon dioxide and gives us a vehicle to create carbon-neutral buildings.\" The energy used to harvest wood, he said, is much less than the enormous amount required to produce concrete and steel. \"There is no other building material that is grown by the Sun,\" he said. \"We've calculated that the North American forests grow enough wood for a 20-story wood building every 8-10 minutes.\" Ultimately, building in wood, Green argues, creates an economic incentive to plant more forests. \"The climate story is really happening at both ends of the argument -- by using more wood we encourage countries around the world to plant more trees. \"About 20% of man's carbon footprint comes from deforestation, this creates an important incentive for reforestation,\" he said. In terms of carbon footprint, a 20-story plyscraper put against its counterpart in concrete and steel is the equivalent of taking 900 cars off the road for a year, MGA estimates. But the established nature of concrete and steel means that CLT will not replace urban building materials overnight. Concerns over fire and inherent problems with its acoustic qualities (apartments need additional acoustic measures to keep noise from traveling) have meant that the construction establishment has been slow to come to the party. In Vienna, for example, the Austrian fire services are working with architects to test their plans. \"The main factor is that everyone wants to build higher and higher buildings. An 84-meter-high building in Europe is not usual and there are a lot of necessities that have to be realized,\" fire service spokesman Christian Wegner told The Guardian newspaper. \"A few of us were upset because it was crazy to present an idea like this that has not been discussed with everyone yet. \"They have to carry out special tests on the correct combination of concrete and wood. We also want to develop a more fail-safe sprinkler system. I expect they will pass the tests but if they develop the building as they say they will, it will be a serious project.\" Green counters that CLT is as fire resistant as other new-builds made by traditional means and likens its ability to burn to trying to set a redwood on fire with a lit match, with any charring creating an insulation layer that protects the wood underneath. Even so, the industry remains largely skeptical of a process that -- while having obvious advantages in terms of speed -- is still on par with steel and concrete construction in terms of cost. \"It will become cheaper but it's too new to be significantly less expensive,\" Green said, adding that the difficulty lies in competing with a well-honed and century-old system of designing, building and budgeting for concrete and steel. \"The culture of building and the culture of developing buildings is very conservative,\" he said. \"The hardest part of my job is not the engineering and the design or the innovation, it's really about changing the public's perception of what's possible.\" Ultimately, buildings of the future are likely to be a mixture of wooden components and concrete and steel; combining the stability of concrete with the flexibility and speed of wood. Leading timber specialist at the engineering group ARUP, Andrew Lawrence, said that shear walls -- the core of tall buildings which provide stability against the lateral force of the wind or seismic activity -- are likely to continue to be made from concrete and steel. However, the real savings from wood come when all the cost elements of making a tall building are taken into account. \"Clients are missing a trick with wood,\" he said, adding that dollar-for-dollar as a pure construction material wood can still struggle to be cheaper than concrete. \"What you need to do if you want an economic wood solution is to think about all the aspects from outset. \"You will save on the program because it's all dry and is quick to erect and potentially, if you're making an office building, you can leave a lot of the wood exposed, saving on the cost and time of installing finishes.\" Apart from having a sustainable solution, Lawrence says, clients will gain a building that looks good too. \"If you leave the wood exposed, you can have a really nice environment inside the building,\" he says. \"There are studies that show that people are happier inside wood structures.\"","highlights":"Wood is making a comeback as a construction material .\nNew engineered woods allow for greater strength and heights in buildings ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Icelandic photographer Sigga Ella wanted to show that people with Down syndrome are more than a chromosomal abnormality. They are diverse and they're unique, just like everyone else in the world. Ella's series, \"First and foremost I am,\" consists of 21 portraits of people ranging from 9 months to 60 years old. She chose the number 21 to represent chromosome 21, the location of the most common genetic mutation causing the condition. It is currently on exhibit at the Reykjav\u00edk Museum of Photography and will be featured in May at the Warsaw Festival of Art Photography. Ella shot the photos in 2013 and 2014 as part of a final project at The School of Photography in Reykjavik. She recently shared the images with CNN iReport. The inspiration started with a radio interview Ella heard in which people were discussing ethical questions brought up by prenatal tests to detect birth defects. She hopes her photos shine a light on \"the beauty and diversity of mankind\" and make us wonder if a future without that diversity is desirable. \"I am not against prenatal\/genetic testing for abnormalities but I think we need to stop and think what's next. ... It's necessary to open the discussion and educate people more about Down syndrome. It's not a disease or a flaw. Parents of children with Down syndrome ... wouldn't exchange them for anything in the world.\" The title of the series, \"First and foremost I am,\" comes from a newspaper article by Halldora Jonsdottir, a 30-year-old woman who is also featured in Ella's project. \"I have Down syndrome but FIRST AND FOREMOST I AM Halldora,\" Jonsdottir writes. \"I do a million things that other people do. My life is meaningful and good because I choose to be positive and see the good things in life. I go to work, attend school and have hobbies.\" Jonsdottir goes on to say, \"Who is perfect? Who can say, that we who have Down syndrome are worth less that anyone else? We are all different and would it be so great if we were all alike?\" Ella staged the portraits against a floral background because she wanted the subjects \"to stand out but also underline that all kinds of flowers can grow and flourish together.\" The photo shoots lasted from one to three hours. She said she didn't give any coaching or direction for how they should pose; she just talked with them and waited for the right moment to shoot. \"My favorite part of this project was how relaxed the atmosphere was. No one was pretending to be anything, the emotions were real and some of the times, there was such genuine happiness.\"","highlights":"Sigga Ella's portraits show people with Down syndrome from 9 months to 60 years old .\nShe hopes her photos shine a light on \"the beauty and diversity of mankind\""}
{"article":"Jenson Button, newly wearing a wedding ring, can afford to smile even if some of the rituals of his long career in Formula One will not be repeated at Sunday\u2019s Australian Grand Prix. Three times he has won around Albert Park. There is little chance of that tally being added to in his temperamental McLaren-Honda. There is absolutely no chance of a pre-race coffee and post-race celebratory fish and chips at the Stokehouse on St Kilda beach. It has burned down. McLaren's Jenson Button is gearing up for his 16th season in Formula One . Button has recorded three victories in Melbourne during his career . But, aged 35, just being here is the great boon. A 16th season beckons after he feared being dropped last year to make way for Fernando Alonso, the incoming double world champion from Ferrari. But he was kept on \u2014 the result of a boardroom fight between McLaren chairman Ron Dennis, who favoured Kevin Magnussen partnering Alonso, and fellow shareholder Mansour Ojjeh, who supported whichever driver Dennis did not want. Ojjeh won. \u2018This is where I should be,\u2019 said Button in the paddock on Thursday. \u2018It doesn\u2019t feel like a bonus, it feels normal, \u2014 and exciting because it is such an exciting new package of engine and car.\u2019 But as cruel irony would have it, Alonso will miss this race after he banged his head in testing and Magnussen has been called up to replace him in tandem with Button. Button poses with the NSX concept vehicle at a Honda F1 Grand Prix press conference . Alonso\u2019s accident in Barcelona last month prompted a host of theories: among them that he had a fit before losing control or suffered an electric shock. The second theory is totally denied by the team. Button, however, was concerned enough to examine the data of Alonso\u2019s car to satisfy himself there was nothing for him to fear. \u2018I will not get into a car unless I am 100 per cent sure that it is safe,\u2019 he said. \u2018I spent hours going through the data with the engineers and talking to them about the incident. \u2018There was nothing wrong with the car whatsoever. I needed to know that before getting into the car at the next test, so I made certain of it. \u2018When you are driving at the limit, you need to be sure. I trust these guys and that is why I have the confidence to drive it this weekend.\u2019 Yes, but not as fast as McLaren would like. They are nowhere near the top teams \u2014 in expected order: Mercedes, by miles, Williams, Red Bull and Ferrari. Button, a glass-half-full sort of man, was realistic in his assessment of his team\u2019s prospects. Button married his fiancee Jessica Michibata in a secret ceremony in Hawaii in January . \u2018We definitely won\u2019t be fighting for a win here,\u2019 he said. \u2018The important thing for us is to see improvements every race and progress. \u2018The power unit package is so tight and so advanced that you do have issues and we have had more issues than we would have liked. \u2018Whether we score points here or not is irrelevant; it is all about improvements race to race. \u2018I would rather not score points here and then win a race later in the year.\u2019 This prognosis is a bit dispiriting given the expectations generated by McLaren\u2019s new partnership with Honda. Should the team\u2019s fortunes not turn around, questions will be asked about the success of the restructuring carried out a year ago. Martin Whitmarsh, who it was yesterday announced will take over as chief executive of Sir Ben Ainslie\u2019s America\u2019s Cup challenge, was sacked as team principal. Eric Boullier was brought in to replace him and Dennis took on a more involved role as chief executive. \u2018We are a year behind the other manufacturers and the design is more aggressive to be a challenge to Mercedes in the future,\u2019 added Button. \u2018Honda are the manufacturer who will take it to Mercedes. There are going to be teething problems, but it is about answering those issues right now.\u2019 While Button brings his experience to bear, another British driver, Will Stevens, is just starting out. The 23-year-old Essex-born racer made his debut in Abu Dhabi for Caterham last November and the Australian Grand Prix should be his first race for Manor, if they qualify by the 107 per cent rule \u2014 within seven per cent of the pole-sitting car\u2019s time. He drove well on his debut and was assured in his press briefing yesterday. Stevens, whose father is a successful financial figure, comes with an estimated \u00a35million of personal sponsorship to fund his ride. He has signed a one-year contract. \u2018Two months ago you couldn\u2019t say I would definitely be here,\u2019 he said of the last-minute deal that saved Manor. \u2018There were other options, but we held out for this.\u2019 He has even less chance of scoring points than Button. \u2018We need to try to be here at the end of the race to pick up the pieces,\u2019 he said.","highlights":"Jenson Button has recorded three victories in Melbourne during his career .\nThe McLaren driver was kept on for 16th season due to a boardroom fight .\nHe married his fiancee Jessica Michibata in a secret ceremony in January ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Pi Day is going to be extra special this year, as 2015 stretches the symbolic March 14 celebration out a little longer to 3.1415. And if you mark pi at 9:26.53 in the morning or night, you're just a little more in line with the celebrated irrational number that never ends. To 31 decimal places, pi is 3.1415926535897932384626433832795. A few more tidbits about pi and Pi Day: . About pi . Pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. It's not equal to the ratio of any two whole numbers, so an approximation -- 22\/7 -- is used in many calculations. Pi is essential in architecture and construction and was used frequently by early astronomers. Pi has been known for about 4,000 years, but it started to be called by the Greek letter only in the 1700s. The origin of Pi Day . Pi Day started 27 years ago at San Francisco's Exploratorium. Physicist Larry Shaw, who worked in the electronics group at the museum, started celebrating pi on March 14, 1988, primarily with museum staffers. The tradition has grown to embrace math enthusiasts from all walks of life. Celebrations . This year, the Exploratorium is hosting a day-long celebration at its facility on Pier 15, including a Pi Procession, servings of pie and a pizza pie dough-tossing event. Pi Day is also Albert Einstein's birthday. In Princeton, New Jersey, where Einstein lived for more than two decades, signs of the scientist permeate the Pi Day festivities, from birthday parties at the Historical Society of Princeton to an Einstein lookalike contest. Plus the requisite pie-eating, pie-throwing and pizza pie creation. For more about pi, visit www.piday.org.

{"article":"(CNN)After enduring about four days at sea under stressful conditions, Tyke, an African elephant, escaped during a circus performance, crushing her trainer to death and injuring dozens of others while storming through the streets of Honolulu. Tyke suffered a slow and painful death after being hit by a barrage of bullets fired by police officers. That incident happened 20 years ago, but the welcome announcement last week by Feld Entertainment -- parent company to Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus -- that it plans to retire elephants from its circuses by 2018 is a reminder of how that controversy lingers. In analyzing the horrific experience involving Tyke, it was reported that the elephant had been rebellious before she arrived on our shores, and she is said to have had a history of acting out and being unpredictable. And though she was not submissive and was difficult to train, her owners sent her to Honolulu anyway. Sadly, performing animals in circuses and traveling shows are too often subjected to inhumane conditions, especially in their training. Reward-based training takes time and patience, which are things that many circus trainers do not have. Instead, these trainers frequently resort to other inhumane means, involving beating the animals, using electrical prods, depriving them of food, chaining them and other brutal methods to force the animals into submission. Following this sort of brutal training, the animals may appear tame, but they are still wild and their original wild instincts will appear if provoked. Meanwhile, animals that are no longer useful to the circus or traveling shows due to age or temperament may be given away or sold to other less reputable organizations. They lack proper veterinary care, and what little quality of life they did have is diminished further. The welfare of the animal is not taken into account. Rather than being treated as a commodity by the owner, animals should be protected and well cared for. Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey has said it prides itself on providing a healthy environment for animals. Yet whatever provisions they may make, the reality is that circuses are particularly unsuited to meet the unique needs of elephants. These extremely intelligent animals live in large family groups when in the wild, and they form close social ties with other elephants. But the circus environment keeps them isolated and provides little to no interaction with their own species. Their herd-like behavior is ignored when they are being trained to perform. These very social animals, simply put, should not be living in solitary confinement. Animal welfare advocates have often been criticized as being against \"fun.\" We are told that circuses and traveling shows are about education. But what could one possibly learn about animals from watching these shows? Observing wild animals perform unnatural tricks while dancing in tutus only teaches the public that the sole purpose of animals is our entertainment. Are these really the values we want our children to learn? Wildlife sanctuaries and accredited zoos should exist for conservation, preservation and propagation of species and for public education. This is where learning should occur. Wild animals should be permitted to exist undisturbed in their natural environments, and when they must be confined, it should be in a natural setting consistent with their physical and behavioral needs. This is the proper setting for education and study. Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus has come a long way in its thinking, and for that we congratulate the company for its decision to move the elephants to its sanctuary in Florida. Rather than fighting the many cities and counties that have taken steps to pass anti-circus and anti-elephant ordinances, the company instead is putting its resources toward the study and protection of elephants. With this step, we look forward to the day that it, and other circuses, phase out all wild animals, including the lions and tigers that also are featured in their shows. After all, wild and exotic animals are not meant to entertain us. The Hawaiian Humane Society feels strongly about the humane treatment of all animals, whether domesticated or wild. Our organization, like others in the animal welfare movement, seeks to prevent any practice that might produce pain, stress, injury or suffering to any animal. This is an important part of creating a more humane society -- for people and all animals.","highlights":"Feld Entertainment plans to retire elephants from its circuses .\nPamela Burns: We congratulate the company for its decision to relocate elephants ."}
{"article":"Moscow (CNN)In his first substantive comments since Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov's death, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday called the killing a \"disgrace\" and lashed out at what he called \"extremists\" and protesters. Nemtsov had been one of Putin's harshest critics and had been arrested several times for speaking against the President's government. The 55-year-old opposition leader was gunned down Friday night in Moscow as he walked across a bridge about 100 meters (330 feet) from the Kremlin with his girlfriend, Ukrainian model Anna Duritskaya, 23. His slaying spurred thousands to rally in his honor in Moscow, with many calling him a true Russian patriot at his funeral Tuesday. Nemtsov isn't the first of Putin's critics to turn up dead, with others including Anna Politkovskaya (who was fatally shot) and Alexander Litvinenko (who was poisoned). The Kremlin has staunchly denied accusations that it's targeting political opponents or had anything to do with the deaths. The Russian leader has condemned Nemtsov's killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate, the Kremlin has said. He also wrote to Nemtsov's mother, saying he shared her grief, and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice. Yet those expressions came in Kremlin statements. Wednesday was the first day Putin spoke at length on the subject, remarks that were reported by state media outlets. Referring to \"the daring killing of Boris Nemtsov in the very heart of our capital city,\" he said, \"Russia should be made secure, at last, from the disgrace and tragedies of (this) kind.\" The President added, according to the official Tass news agency, \"The most serious attention should be paid to high-profile crimes, including those having political motives.\" No one has been arrested in connection with Nemtsov's death, though Russia's Federal Security Service chief Alexander Bortnikov did say there are suspects, Tass reported. The same agency, citing Russia's Finance Ministry, said that investigators are looking for a car that belongs to a state enterprise that provides services to that ministry. Putin didn't identify any person or group that might be directly responsible. But Wednesday he took the opportunity to lay blame generally at what he called \"color technologies,\" an apparent reference to using mass street protests and overseas funding to try to overthrow a government. \"The actions of extremists are becoming more and more widespread,\" the President said. \"We are running into attempts of using so-called color technologies, from organizing illegal street protests to open propaganda (expressing) hatred in social networks.\" CNN's Alla Eshchenko reported from Moscow, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Matthew Chance contributed to this report.","highlights":"Opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot dead while walking near Kremlin with girlfriend .\nVladimir Putin: Russia should be safe from \"disgrace and tragedies\" like Nemtsov's killing .\nRussian President criticizes \"extremists\" for use of \"illegal street protests\" and social media ."}

{"article":"(CNN)Once again, the lure of ISIS may have ensnared another group of foreigners -- this time, medical students suspected of traveling to Syria to work in ISIS-controlled hospitals. The group of 11 people includes seven Britons, an American, a Canadian and two Sudanese, Turkish lawmaker Mehmet Ali Ediboglu told CNN on Sunday. Ediboglu, an opposition lawmaker, told The Observer that he had spoken with the students' families, who were convinced their loved ones wanted to work for ISIS, and were asking him for help tracking them down in neighboring Syria. \"They have been cheated, brainwashed. That is what I, and their relatives, think,\" Ediboglu said, according to the newspaper. But he also stressed that the group did not travel with the intention of joining the battle. \"Let's not forget about the fact that they are doctors,\" he told The Observer. \"They went there to help, not to fight.\" In a joint statement, the students' and doctors' families said their children are humanitarians who went \"to Turkey willingly to offer voluntary medical help to those refugees who are in need of medical care on Turkey's borders.\" They have since \"disappeared,\" the statement said. \"We have heard from the British, Turkish and Sudanese authorities that we have so far met, but we hope that the respectable governments of these countries would enforce, speed up and coordinate more effective measures to ensure the safety of our children wherever they are and bring them back to us as soon as possible,\" the statement said. Eight of the group are medical students who've just graduated, and the three others are in their final year of medical school, he said. They'd been studying in Khartoum, Sudan. At least seven of their mothers and fathers are living near the Turkey-Syria border, pleading for their return, according to The Observer. In an interview published Monday in Turkey's H\u00fcrriyet Daily News, the group of parents said they were worried and vowed not to leave Turkey without their children. Dr. Maumoon Abdulqadir said he was sending a message to his daughter, Lena, who is one of the students. \"I know you want to help people and be of use. But you can do this in another way,\" he told the newspaper. \"There are many who need your help. But this is not the way. Please, come back.\" British officials said they are aware of the report. \"We are providing consular assistance to their families and we have informed the Turkish police to try and ascertain their whereabouts,\" the British Foreign & Commonwealth Office said in a statement. Officials have warned that a growing number of foreign fighters are traveling to join ISIS' ranks. Estimates about how many medical personnel the group has recruited are harder to come by. Last year, a 19-year-old Colorado woman was arrested at Denver International Airport as she was about to start a journey to an ISIS camp, where she hoped to be a nurse.

{"article":"(CNN)A salary dispute between North and South Korea has sent jitters through factory owners operating at an industrial complex that is supposed to be a symbol of cooperation for the divided Korean peninsula. The disagreement started in late February, when the North Korean government demanded an increase of around $8.60 a month for North Korean employees working in the Kaesong Industrial Complex. South Korea is working on a response to the demands, leaving factory owners worried about the threat of a factory shutdown. \"I'm already nervous about the situation because of the traumatic experience in 2013 when the North closed down the complex,\" said Yoo Chang-geun, the South Korean head of an automobile parts manufacturer that employs 400 North Koreans in Kaesong. Yoo's company, SJ Tech, operates out of Kaesong, which is just north of the Demilitarized Zone in North Korean territory. He was referring to North Korea's monthslong closure of Kaesong in 2013, during a period of heightened tension on the peninsula. About 125 South Korean companies operate out of Kaesong, employing more than 50,000 North Korean workers. An official from the South Korean government's Unification Ministry, who according to policy spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity, says companies at Kaesong pay their North Korean workers an average of $155.50 a month. North Korea is demanding an increase of roughly 5.5%, to an equivalent $164.10 a month. The South Korean government argues that the salary hike is a breach of an existing agreement for the industrial park, which first opened in 2004. The official called the North's request a \"one-sided demand.\"  The official did not rule out the possibility that penalties could be imposed on South Korean companies if they individually agree to raise employee salaries. Manufacturers in Kaesong rely on the government in Seoul to represent them in negotiations with Pyongyang. \"It feels like we're entering a very difficult phase where innocent corporations are being beaten up by political fights between the North and South,\" Kim Seo-Jin, the director of Corporate Association of the Kaesong Industrial Complex, said Wednesday. Experts say this isn't the first time the North and South have butted heads over employee salaries in Kaesong. The industrial park was established as a symbol of cooperation at a time when a previous government in South Korea was pursuing a \"Sunshine Policy\" of friendship with its northern rival. South Korean companies benefited from the extremely low cost of North Korean labor.  Meanwhile, North Korea gained a valuable stream of hard currency revenue by appropriating an undisclosed amount of salary from its citizens working in Kaesong. South Korean employers also made a practice of giving small food bonuses to some hungry employees. For a time, this came in the form of \"Choco Pies,\" a packaged South Korean dessert.  The snacks reportedly became highly-prized items on the black market in the communist North's rigidly controlled economy.  Eventually, employers transitioned to giving workers instant noodles, as one former Kaesong factory owner told CNN in 2014, \"in order to provide a more substantial snack.\" \"The whole project is built with an understanding that North Korean wages should and will continue to rise,\" says John Delury, associate professor at Yonsei University's graduate school of international studies in Seoul. But one factory owner said the communist regime's most recent approach to the salaries is problematic. \"The amount of the pay raise demanded this time is small,\" said  SJ Tech's Yoo Chang-geun. \"But having this kind of precedent may lead to losing control of the operation in the complex.\" Experts say Seoul and Pyongyang's approach to the Kaesong salary dispute will serve as an important barometer for the direction of future relations between the rival governments. \"Kaesong is the last living legacy of the Sunshine Policy,\" says professor Delury of Yeonsei University. \"If something like wage disputes lead to the shutdown or freezing of Kaesong, that would be a major blow.\"","highlights":"The disagreement started in late February .\nNorth Korea demanded a pay increase; South Korea's working on a response ."}
{"article":"(CNN)The recent controversy over a video showing University of Oklahoma students, who also were members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, reciting a racist chant revealed a key difference in approaches to parenting. The university said Levi Pettit and Parker Rice encouraged their brothers to sing the lyrics, which included multiple references to the \"n-word\" and mention of lynching. The two young men were expelled. And the fraternity was shut down. What caught my attention was the reaction of the families \u2014 the Pettits and the Rices. They couldn't have been more different. That convinced me that this story wasn't just about racist and juvenile behavior, but also about parenting. Who raised these kids? And shouldn't they have been taught better? At some point, didn't it occur to these young men that they were not only shaming themselves, but also their families? In Dallas, protesters gathered outside the Rice home, holding signs with messages such as: \"Racism is taught.\" Parker Rice issued a statement, which was delivered to the Dallas Morning News by his father, Bob Rice. In it, Parker apologized for actions that he called \"wrong and reckless.\" However, Bob Rice had no response to the controversy. He told reporters: \"At the moment, we are not doing interviews.\" That is not good enough. Parenthood isn't like politics. It doesn't come with a \"no comment\" button we can press when the job gets uncomfortable. We haven't heard from Levi Pettit. His parents, Brody and Susan, addressed their son's misbehavior in a statement, which was given to the newspaper and posted on the family's website. It read in part: . \"As parents of Levi, we love him and care for him deeply. He made a horrible mistake, and will live with the consequences forever. However, we also know the depth of our son's character. He is a good boy, but what we saw in those videos is disgusting. While it may be difficult for those who only know Levi from the video to understand, we know his heart, and he is not a racist. ... \"Of course, we are sad for our son -- but more importantly, we apologize to the community he has hurt. We would also like to apologize to the entire African-American community, University of Oklahoma student body and administration. Our family has the responsibility to apologize, and also to seek forgiveness and reconciliation.\" That's an impressive statement. I applaud the Pettits for stepping up and refusing to blindly defend their son, as many parents might have done. They did what parents are supposed to do: They took responsibility for the actions of the person they raised. Who knew that would be so controversial? Ever since the apologies were offered, there's been discussions in this country about whether it's really necessary for parents to apologize for the actions of their grown children. Last week, while hosting a radio show in San Diego, I brought up the story of the video and pointed to the different approaches that the Rices and the Pettits have to parenting -- all the way from \"we are not doing interviews\" to \"our family has the responsibility to apologize.\" The Pettits had the right idea, I insisted. A caller disagreed, saying he didn't see why he should have to apologize if his adult son did something wrong.  \"He's his own person,\" he said. Based on what I've heard in the last few days, I would imagine that there are many people who agree with the caller. They seem to believe that, when their son or daughter turns 18, their job is finished. They can't wait to wash their hands of any additional responsibility, and they might even frame their retreat as a way of advancing the principle that everyone should take responsibility for his own actions. That sounds good. But I don't think it's either\/or. Of course, individuals should take responsibility for their actions. Yet, as the Pettits demonstrated with their statement, when something goes terribly wrong, there is usually enough responsibility to go around.  When appropriate, parents can take a slice. Besides, I bet a lot of parents believe -- as I do -- that we should never stop loving our children. But at some point, it's perfectly fine for us to just stop claiming them as our own? It just looks like some parents can't wait to find the exit. Here's an idea. We tell people to drink responsibly. We tell them to drive responsibly. We need to start telling them to parent responsibly. After all, parenting a child is the most important job that many of us will have in this world. And there is no date of retirement.","highlights":"The controversy over University of Oklahoma students reciting a racist chant raises a number of issues .\nRuben Navarrette: Is it necessary for parents to apologize for the bad actions of their grown children?"}
{"article":"Tikrit, Iraq (CNN)Two men in blue smocks were mopping up blood spilled in the main entrance to the Dijla Hospital south of Tikrit when we arrived there mid-morning Friday. The air shook with outgoing rockets and artillery roaring toward the center of the city. We were escorted by men from the Badr Brigade, the biggest and best-organized Iranian-backed force fighting ISIS. As we got out of our car, a man wearing a vest with the emblem of the Iraqi Red Crescent beckoned urgently to video journalist Mary Rogers to come inside. He led her to a gurney surrounded by four or five men, some wearing blue disposable surgical gowns, others in dark green military fatigues. They were huddled over a man naked to the waist, a thick plastic tube inserted in his side, red with blood, leading to a bottle filling up with more blood. The wounded man -- no one knew his name -- had been shot in the head, the chest and the leg. He was motionless. The head doctor, in dark green combat fatigues, told me the man was in critical condition. All the while, the windows of the building shook from the concussion of the bombardment of central Tikrit. From the sound, it was clear that artillery and rocket launchers were nearby. Several other wounded fighters were in the entrance, but their condition was much less grave. One, who identified himself as Sadiq, had been shot in the upper thigh, but was fully conscious. He told producer Kareem Khadder he had been shot in central Tikrit that morning, recalling at the time he was uncertain whether it was shrapnel or a bullet because the fighting was so intense. While Mary and Kareem were doing that interview, I walked around the hospital to see if there was anything else that might help us put together a report. It was a ramshackle place, it looked like much of the facility had been in a state of neglect for a while, perhaps because until recently it was in no-man's land. When I went back to see where Mary and Kareem were, I was told Mary was down a corridor where an \"operation\" was about to take place. Mary was invited to film the operation. I found her putting on a surgical gown and blue shoe covers. Several men rolled a gurney through the corridor in our direction. The same critically wounded man was wheeled into a side room. He never made it into the operating theater. A different set of doctors or medics started working on him, pumping air into his lungs, then applying CPR. His chest took a final heave, as the doctors tried to find a pulse, but there was no pulse to find. There was no \"operation.\" This was a last, desperate attempt to stop this unknown man from dying. His face was yellow and waxy. He was dead, but the doctors didn't call time of death, . In the meantime, our escorts were calling us to leave, we needed to move to our next destination, which they had told us was the position from which artillery and rocket launchers were at work. Mary, who was at the far end of the gurney, wedged her way out and we went outside.  She went to the car, I chatted with a pair of Iraqi journalists in the entrance. They had been here for more than two weeks. I bade them farewell, and walked toward our car. And then, everything changed. I heard a commotion behind me, and the doctor I had spoken to before passed me, shouting, \"Grab all the cameras! Get the cameras!\" \"What's the problem?\" I asked him. He didn't provide an explanation. \"Give us your cameras now!\" he barked at me. A group of militiamen had surrounded Kareem, and was insisting he give them his small camera. More militiamen, plus some of the hospital staff gathered around him, shouting angrily that all cameras must be surrendered. Right next to me a tall man with a military shirt over running pants raised his rifle, about to shoot in the air. This is going to get very messy, I thought to myself. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed and there was no shooting. But everyone was very agitated. Much shouting ensued between our entourage and the local militiamen. Our chief escort, Ma'in Al-Kadhimi, was gesturing wildly and arguing with them to calm down, but he wasn't having much luck. He is a commander of the Badr Organisation, but these men were with the Soldiers of the Imam Brigade (Kataib Jund Al-Imam in Arabic). It's a separate group, and clearly Al-Kadhimi, who was treated with deference by his own men, didn't enjoy the same esteem here. In the meantime, I joined Mary in our car, concerned that too many of us arguing with this large group would only make matters worse. Kareem was busy negotiating outside the hospital. We locked the car doors and did our best to pretend we were simply waiting patiently to move. Soon a group of men armed with AK-47 assault rifles gathered outside the car, knocking on the window and angrily gesturing that we must give them the camera. Mary discreetly pulled out the data card with the footage she had just shot and replaced it with an empty one. It's an old trick that sometimes works in situations like these.  Although I could understand everything this crowd was saying, I feigned ignorance. This went on for about 45 minutes. Some in our entourage were trying to keep the crowd from banging on the car windows and wrenching open the locked doors. Kareem hid his small camera in one of the cars and saw the big camera being taken away by several people. Kareem followed the camera to make sure it was safe. Inside, everyone was shouting, with Kareem refusing to do anything before someone explained what was going on. The armed men wanted the sequence of the dying fighter deleted, and weren't going to take \"no\" for an answer. Kareem then went inside one of the rooms to carry on negotiations. Armed men barred Kareem from leaving the room. Eventually, Kareem said we should delete the sequence of the dying man, after our Iraqi security guard had said we needed to do just that -- otherwise, we were in trouble. Kareem looked at the camera and noticed the card was missing. A media-savvy member of the Soldiers of the Imam Brigade insisted we were hiding the card with the footage. Finally Kareem returned and said that if we didn't hand over the camera there would be trouble. The atmosphere was such that we realized that not handing over the camera would make matters much worse. So we gave Kareem the camera and waited. A few minutes later, he returned. They know the data card is empty. They want the one with the pictures, he said. So we gave it to him. Soon Kareem was back. \"They don't know how to delete the pictures of the dying man,\" he said. So Mary went with him inside the hospital to delete the footage of the dying man. To cut a long, tense story short, Mary didn't delete the footage. Someone else did, all the footage from the hospital. After about an hour and a half, we finally left the hospital compound. Our escort, Al-Kadhimi, was shaken. He, and we, were reminded that with all the different armed groups fighting on the Tikrit front, there might be unity against ISIS, but that's about where it ends.","highlights":"A CNN crew finds medical personnel trying to save a wounded fighter in Tikrit .\nBut when the man dies, demands start for the crew's video footage ."}
{"article":"Tottenham Hotspur have been given the go-ahead to build their new stadium after a local firm admitted defeat in its objections to the \u00a3400 million development. Archway Sheet Metal Works launched a legal challenge to a compulsory purchase order (CPO) rejected last month but could have appealed. The firm has now decided not to do so, it announced on Friday. How Tottenham's new stadium will look for night games from 2018-19 season onwards . Archway Sheet Metal Works, which is located next to White Hart Lane on the last patch of land Tottenham needed for their stadium development argued that the compulsory purchase order was unlawful . Now that Archway have dropped their case, Spurs have the go-ahead for their new 56,000-plus capacity stadium at White Hart Lane . The company announced in a statement: 'We have always been willing to negotiate with the club on a reasonable and proper basis. 'We will continue to try to achieve a proper settlement by agreement if that is possible.' Spurs have relocated more than 70 local businesses from the site, which is adjacent to the White Hart Lane home they have occupied since 1899. By moving for what is expected to be the 2018-19 season, they will increase their capacity from barely 36,000 to 56,250. Before then Tottenham expect to move elsewhere for at least one season, possibly alternating between Wembley and sharing with League One (third tier) club Milton Keynes Dons. The club also applied several years ago to move permanently to the Olympic Stadium but lost out to London rivals West Ham United.

{"article":"Sean O'Brien believes blowing a Grand Slam in Wales 'might not have been the worst thing in the world' as Ireland eye the World Cup after retaining their RBS 6 Nations title. Leinster flanker O'Brien grabbed two tries as Ireland thumped Scotland 40-10 at Murrayfield to claim back-to-back Six Nations titles for the first time since 1949. The 28-year-old backed up scores from captain Paul O'Connell and centre Jared Payne as Ireland denied England the title by virtue of points-difference. Sean O'Brien of Ireland celebrates with the Six Nations trophy after the 40-10 win over Scotland on Saturday . England saw off France 55-35 in a madcap Twickenham encounter, but fell foul of the triple-bill Super Saturday set-up for the second year running, six points short on the target set by Ireland. Happy to embrace hindsight with the title secure for another year, O'Brien believes defeat to Wales must now act as a harsh World Cup lesson for Joe Schmidt's men. 'Looking back now it might not have been the worst thing in the world,' said O'Brien, of Ireland losing 23-16 in Wales to spoil their Grand Slam chase. 'We know we can learn and move forward. That was the biggest thing to come out of last week: that we didn't do our jobs correctly and we didn't do what we did during the week.

Scott Williams goes over during the 23-16 victory over Ireland, which ended their Grand Slam challenge . Ireland rediscovered their attacking rhythm in Edinburgh however, their four tries against Scotland matching their previous tally for the entire tournament. O'Brien is adamant Ireland can play whatever brand of rugby required to get the job done under shrewd boss Schmidt. 'There has been a lot of talk about the style of play the last few weeks but defences in this competition are very strong,' said O'Brien. 'With analysis and what not, they are able to close people down and the quality of player and strength in depth, you have really good players playing against you. Captain\u00a0Paul O'Connell holds aloft the Six Nations trophy after Ireland were crowned champions . 'You have to bring them to a place where they are under a lot of pressure and maybe we haven't done that in the last few weeks.

'We have been trying to play a bit like that the last few weeks but we haven't been, and we've let ourselves down at times with our own errors as well, letting teams into games.

{"article":"(CNN)A group of medical students -- including an American, seven Britons and a Canadian -- may be the latest Westerners to join ISIS. It's become a familiar story: Young people give up their futures in Western democratic nations to join the terrorist network establishing a self-declared Islamic state in the Middle East. Last month, three teenage British girls suspected of wanting to join ISIS may have gone to Syria, authorities said. Their fates remain unknown. An estimated 3,400 Westerners have gone to join ISIS in its bloody quest to establish an Islamist state in Iraq and Syria, said Nicholas Rasmussen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center. Analysts and U.S. officials agree: ISIS is skilled at luring Westerners, attracting far greater numbers than al Qaeda.  How is it doing this? ISIS recruits are often young -- sometimes disillusioned teenagers trying to find purpose and make their mark. \"The general picture provided by foreign fighters of their lives in Syria suggests camaraderie, good morale and purposeful activity, all mixed in with a sense of understated heroism, designed to attract their friends as well as to boost their own self-esteem,\" counterterrorism expert Richard Barrett wrote last year in a report called \"Foreign fighters in Syria.\" Fawaz Gerges, professor of Middle East studies at The London School of Economics, put it more bluntly: . \"ISIS provides these deluded young men and women with an adventurous trip.\" Many recruits come from educated, well-to-do backgrounds, like 25-year-old Abu Anwar of Britain. He said he had no problem leaving a comfortable lifestyle to join ISIS. \"I'm from the south of England. I grew up in a middle-class family,\" he told CNN. \"Life was easy back home. I had a life. I had a car. But the thing is, you cannot practice Islam back home. We see all around us evil. We see pedophiles. We see homosexuality. We see crime. We see rape.\" The names: Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West . Some are lured by the possibility of dying as a martyr so they can enjoy a sumptuous afterlife. Others may succumb to more tangible promises. ISIS loyalists are told they will receive gifts from Allah, wrote Aqsa Mahmood, a young British woman who left Scotland to join ISIS and now is an ISIS recruiter. Such gifts include \"a house with free electricity and water provided to you due to the Khilafah (the caliphate or state) and no rent included,\" Mahmood wrote. ISIS' slick propaganda videos resemble trailers for Hollywood action movies. One hourlong video showed a collection of bombings, executions, kidnappings and beheadings. As one roadside bomb blasts a vehicle into the sky, two men in the background of the video chuckle. ISIS now has the most sophisticated propaganda machine of any terrorist organization, said Matthew Olsen, former director of the National Counterterrorism Center. \"It turns out timely, high-quality media, and it uses social media to secure a widespread following,\" he said. Even the U.S. State Department admits ISIS' propaganda prowess \"is something we have not seen before.\" \"It's something we need to do a lot more work on,\" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said last month. \"We are seeing 90,000, I think, tweets a day that we're combating.\" \"We are way behind. They are far superior and advanced than we are when it comes to new media technologies,\" Maajid Nawaz, a former jihadi and author of \"Radical: My Journey out of Islamist Extremism,\" told CNN last year.  \"... It is very attractive for angry young Muslims when they see these sorts of videos and they hear language that resonates with them.\" The slick strategy offers a big edge over al Qaeda.  ISIS \"has proven far more adept than core al Qaeda -- or any of al Qaeda's affiliates -- at using new media tools to reach a broader audience,\" Rasmussen said. Recruits are also being lured by ISIS' success in its endeavor to create an Islamic state, analysts say. The intelligence community determined that ISIS' battlefield successes gave it \"some recruitment success,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in September. \"Militant groups across the Muslim world see the success ISIS has had so far in Syria and Iraq and opt to join it -- often leaving behind organizations plagued by infighting,\" CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen wrote in a CNN.com column. \"This is a political cult using religion and a perversion of Islam as the shield,\" said Steve Hassan,  founder of Freedom of Mind, a group dedicated to exposing destructive cults and cult behavior. \"But in fact, it's a systematic effort to create an army of basically tranced-out followers.\" That type of brainwashing is what turned Canadian Damian Clairmont into an ISIS militant, said his mother, Christianne Boudreau. \"It's so easy for them to get to our children, to access our children,\" she said. Clairmont died fighting in Syria last year. While ISIS' recruiting success gets a lot of attention, it is hardly drawing a huge percentage of young Westerners. About 130 Canadian citizens have traveled to the Middle East to join ISIS, Canada's intelligence agency estimated last year. About 1,200 French fighters have joined ISIS as well.  Roughly 600 British nationals are believed to have gone to Iraq and Syria, according to research groups, along with another 600 from Germany. In the United States, National Intelligence Director James Clapper has said 180 Americans have tried to go to fight in Syria. But it's unclear how many of those were attempting to join ISIS. Once foreigners go to Iraq or Syria to join ISIS, their odds of going back to their families can be slim. Video clips of foreign jihadists burning their passports show that many have no interest in returning home. Western leaders acknowledge there's work to do. \"It needs every school, every university, every college, every community to recognize they have a role to play, we all have a role to play in stopping people from having their minds poisoned by this appalling death cult,\" British Prime Minister David Cameron said last year. The U.S. government is trying to step up its efforts to counter ISIS propaganda by beefing up a small State Department agency to make it the heart of the fight against the militants' messaging. \"We're seeing their approaches continue to evolve,\" Psaki, the State Department spokeswoman, told CNN. \"We need to continue to make sure ours are evolving and we're combating it in the most strategic way and using every interagency resource.\" But she acknowledged that the United States still has a lot to do. \"We're really going to pick it up now,\" Psaki said. \"We have new people in charge of the office. And we will see what happens over the coming months.\" Several anti-ISIS efforts are already in place. Some European countries have laws that penalize membership in groups such as ISIS, said Barrett, the counterterrorism expert. And U.S. State Department official Richard Stengel said an anti-ISIS messaging campaign has helped prevent youths from joining. \"They're reading the messages, they're hearing the messages -- not just from us but from the hundreds of Islamic clerics who have said that this is a perversion of Islam, from the hundreds of Islamic scholars who have said the same thing,\" Stengel said in October. But Barrett said some officials might not be doing as much as they think. \"Policymakers often underestimate the impact of what is happening in these closed circles even as they overestimate the impact of their own.\" CNN's Josh Levs, Joshua Berlinger, Paula Newton, Jethro Mullen, Catherine E. Shoichet, Mariano Castillo, Laura Koran and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","highlights":"ISIS has a penchant for producing slick videos that resemble trailers for Hollywood action movies .\nAnalyst: Many recruits lack a sense of belonging; some want a lavish afterlife by dying as a \"martyr\"\nHundreds from the UK, Canada, France and the U.S. are suspected of going to join ISIS ."}
{"article":"Washington (CNN)The Justice Department is preparing to bring criminal corruption charges against Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, alleging he used his Senate office to push the business interests of a Democratic donor and friend in exchange for gifts. People briefed on the case say Attorney General Eric Holder has signed off on prosecutors' request to proceed with charges, CNN first reported. An announcement could come within weeks.  Prosecutors are under pressure in part because of the statute of limitation on some of the allegations. Menendez told reporters Friday night he has \"always conducted myself appropriately and in accordance with the law.\" He added: \"And I am not going anywhere.\" Menendez said that because of an ongoing investigation he couldn't answer questions at the news conference, held in Newark. The case could pose a high-profile test of the Justice Department's ability to prosecute sitting lawmakers, having already spawned a legal battle over whether key evidence the government has gathered is protected by the Constitution's Speech and Debate clause. The FBI and prosecutors from the Justice Department's public integrity section, have pursued a variety of allegations against Menendez, who has called the probe part of \"smear campaign\" against him. The government's case centers on Menendez's relationship with Salomon Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist who the senator has called a friend and political supporter. Melgen and his family have been generous donors to the senator and various committees the senator is associated with. RELATED: FBI agents search office of Florida doctor known as Senator's donor . Investigators have focused in part on plane trips Menendez took in 2010 to the Dominican Republic as a guest of Melgen. In 2013, after word of the federal investigation became public, Menendez paid back  Melgen $58,000 for the 2010 plane trips calling his failure to properly disclose the flights an \"oversight.\" Menendez said he has been friends with Melgen for more than 20 years and the two families have spent holidays and other special occasions together. One of the highest ranking Hispanic members of Congress, Menendez is a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He has become one of the Obama administration's most vocal Democratic opponents on two key foreign policy matters -- President Obama's decision to ease the trade embargo against Cuba and also his effort to engage direct negotiations with Iran over that country's nuclear program. Menendez advocated on Melgen's behalf with federal Medicare administrators who accused Melgen of overbilling the government's healthcare program, according to court documents and people briefed on the probe. Melgen was among the top recipients of Medicare reimbursements in recent years, during a time when he was also a major Democratic donor.  Melgen's attorneys have denied any wrongdoing. Prosecutors also are focusing on whether Menendez broke the law in advocating for Melgen's business interest in a Dominican Republic government contract for a port screening equipment. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, at the time, considered donating port screening equipment to the Dominican Republic, which would have hurt the contract of Melgen-controlled company. Menendez, now serving his second full term as senator, led the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2009-2011. During a Senate subcommittee hearing in 2012, Menendez didn't mention ICSSI, Melgen's company, by name, but he did press Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Rooney about an unnamed company who had a contract to X-ray cargo that went through all Dominican ports -- a contract that, he said, Dominican authorities \"don't want to live by.\" \"If those countries can get away with that, they will,\" the senator said. \"And that puts American companies at a tremendous disadvantage.\" Menendez's office said at the time the senator's interest was based on his efforts to combat narcotrafficking in the region. Other lines of inquiry against Menendez had included  allegations he solicited prostitutes in the Dominican Republic, and that he violated the law helping win permanent U.S. residency for two Ecuadorian banking magnates, the Isaias brothers. The prostitution allegations collapsed after the purported prostitutes recanted their story, and the FBI didn't find evidence of wrongdoing in the Isaias matter, according to people briefed on the probe. The FBI probe has already spawned a legal battle between the government, Menendez and his former aides. Last week, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals briefly posted, apparently by accident, documents detailing legal efforts to block certain evidence and testimony the government wants to use. The documents were quickly put back under seal, but not before a reporter with the New Jersey Law Journal secured a copy and later published a story. According to the documents, Menendez's lawyers have sought to claim emails and testimony from aides is protected by the constitutional protections given to members of Congress in carrying out their duties. The speech and debate clause prohibits questioning of members of Congress about \"legislative acts or the motivation for legislative acts.\" The fight centers in part on the Justice Department's attempt to compel testimony from Menendez's aides, some of whom have refused to answer questions to a grand jury. According to the documents, the government wants to question aides about a series of 2012 calls and meetings on Melgen's fight with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a federal agency. Among these is a meeting among Mendedez, Sen. Harry Reid and then Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. The government is also pushing to use emails between Menendez's office and a CBP official about the Dominican ports issue. A federal district court ruled in favor of the government to compel testimony from Menendez's aides, but the appeals court reversed the ruling and ordered a hearing. \"The parties primarily dispute the legislative character of Senator Menendez's two conversations with [then acting CMS administrator Marilyn] Tavenner and his meeting with Secretary Sebelius,\" the appeals court said. \"These communications are not manifestly legislative acts because they are informal communications with executive branch officials, one of whom was at the time a presidential nominee whose nomination was pending before the United States senate.\"","highlights":"An announcement from the Justice Department could come in weeks .\nCase will be a test of ability to prosecute sitting lawmakers ."}
{"article":"It was a night to forget for Manchester United as Arsenal advanced to the FA Cup semi-final and out-of-sorts winger Angel di Maria was sent off for pulling at referee Michael Oliver's shirt. Despite Wayne Rooney levelling with his head after Nacho Monreal's opener, the night belonged to former United striker Danny Welbeck, who sealed the Gunners' victory with a beautifully composed finish. Here, Sportsmail's\u00a0Neil Ashton rates every player's performance at Old Trafford. Arsenal's Danny Welbeck emphatically celebrates his goal, which went on to be the winner against his old club . MANCHESTER UNITED (4-1-4-1) David De Gea: No chance with Monreal finish. Exposed brutally by Valencia when Welbeck raced through to score. Pulled off a couple of world class saves towards the end. 7.5 . Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea had a solid game but was exposed for Arsenal's second goal . Antonio Valencia: Powered forward with lung-busting run for United equaliser. Dreadful, dreadful back pass for Arsenal\u2019s second. 6.5 .

Wojciech Szczesny: Very little to do apart from Rooney\u2019s goal, which he had no chance of doing anything to stop. 7 . Hector Bellerin: Early booking, cleaned out Young. Disciplinary tight-rope after that trying to stop the United winger 7 . Per Mertesacker: Left Koscielny exposed when Rooney scored, just seemed to switch off. Improved as game progressed. 7 . Per Mertesacker (right) and Laurent Koscielny allowed Rooney the space to head home United's equaliser .

Nacho Monreal slips the ball past the oncoming Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea (right) Francis Coquelin: Screening job in front of Arsenal\u2019s back four, rarely left his post. Turning into Mr Reliable. 7.5 . Francis Coquelin showed he is an indispensable player for Arsene Wenger after a solid midfield performance . Santi Cazorla: Switched roles when Ramsey came on, playing in a more advanced position. 7 . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlin: Lovely, jinking run for the opening goal. Arsenal\u2019s best player until he pinged left hamstring. 7.5 . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is floored after seemingly pulling his hamstring in the second half . Mesut Ozil: Clever pass into the feet of Oxlade-Chamberlain in move for Arsenal goal. Lovely lob wedge into Welbeck for penalty appeal. 7.5 . Alexis Sanchez: Such a willing worker, tireless up and down the flank. Flashes of his ability, but lacked his usual goal threat. 7 .

{"article":"This is the incredible moment an eagle soared from the top of the world's tallest tower to its owner on the ground in a record-breaking bird flight. The imperial eagle, called Darshan, had a camera attached to its back as it swooped 2722 feet (830 metres) from the top of Dubai's Burj Khalifa. It captured phenomenal views of the capital of the United Arab Emirates before landing on the arm of its trainer, falconer Jacques-Olivier Travers. Freedom Conservation, the group which organised the attempt, claim it is the highest-ever recorded bird flight from a man-made structure. The imperial eagle, called Darshan, had a camera attached to its back as it swooped 2722 feet (830 metres) from the top of Dubai's Burj Khalifa (pictured) towards the ground where it landed on the arm of its trainer . Darshan, a white-tailed eagle, captured incredible views of the capital of the United Arab Emirates during its flight, which has been hailed the highest-ever bird flight from a man-made structure, according to experts . The bird of prey captured phenomenal views on the Sony Action Cam Mini which was weighs about 300g and was attached to its back, before landing on the arm of its trainer, French falconer Jacques-Olivier Travers . The bird was released from the top of the world's tallest tower before making its journey to its trainer below . The white-tailed eagle, which has been critically endangered for more than 50 years, has previously flown from the top of St Paul's Cathedral in London and the Eiffel Tower in France. Ronald Menzel, director of Freedom Conservation, said the organisation filmed yesterday's bird flight in an attempt to draw more attention to eagle conservation. He told the BBC: '[This] represents a historic opportunity for conservation \u2013 through these incredible images we are bringing this important cause to the attention of people all across the world.' In the clip, which lasts nearly two minutes, the bird takes off from the tower and soars over Dubai, allowing the camera to record stunning aerial views. The camera - a Sony Action Cam Mini - weighed approximately 300g, which is about 10 per cent of the bird's weight. Upon landing on the arm of its trainer, Mr Travers could be seen punching the air with joy before describing the flight as 'perfect'. He said: 'This was an incredible challenge and the most difficult of my career. 'Not only is this the highest vertical flight that has ever been done, but the eagle also had to fly in a totally different environment, with strong wind disturbances caused by the skyscrapers. 'This flight will create huge possibilities for future conservation programs. Freedom Conservation, organisers of the bird flight, prepare by bringing the bird up to the top of the tower .

Mr Travers, who became passionate about birds of prey when he was 12-years-old, waits for Darshan to land . Darshan the eagle swoops down and successfully lands on the arm of its owner, French falconer Mr Travers . Mr Travers punches the air with joy after Darshan lands on his arm after the 2722ft flight from the tower . 'Training and equipping birds of prey with these small cameras will allow us to understand exactly what a bird does when it is released into the wild, and will ultimately help our effort to restore endangered bird populations.' Mr Travers developed his passion for birds at the age of 12, after being given small chicks from a nest. He began training Darshan after selecting him from a breeding facility in Thonon, France. Last year, he completed several successful big flights with his bird of prey including one from the Golden Gallery at St Paul's Cathedral to the base of London's famous Tower Bridge. During the flight over central London in November last year, the eagle captured breath-taking footage of the capital and the River Thames with a high-spec camera mounted on its back. At the time, Mr Travers said: 'I like to bring the birds where they are not expected. For many years, I have taught the birds to fly in nature using a paraglider.' Jacques-Olivier Travers (pictured with Darshan after the incredible flight) described the attempt as 'perfect' Views of Dubai captured by the imperial eagle will be used by the Freedom team to raise awareness of birds . The entire project was carried out by Freedom to try and raise awareness of birds of prey and extinction . Darshan the eagle has previously soared from the top of St Paul's in London and the Eiffel Tower in France . In another impressive flight just a month earlier, Darshan soared from the top of the 206-metre observation deck of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. The bird was released from the inconic structure by its handler, before flying over the River Seine and down into the Trocad\u00e9ro Gardens at 111 miles per hour. Darshan is a white imperial eagle, a bird which was once on the Red List of endangered species but has since been saved from extinction.","highlights":"Darshan the eagle flew from top of\u00a0Dubai's Burj Khalifa to trainer at bottom .\nIt is highest-ever recorded bird flight from man-made structure, experts say .\nBird captured incredible views of United Arab Emirates capital with camera .\nImperial eagle has previously flown off St Paul's Cathedral and Eiffel Tower ."}
{"article":"Roy Keane has urged Manchester United fans to give Louis van Gaal up to three years to prove himself at the Old Trafford helm. The Dutch manager oversaw another disappointing performance and result in United's 2-1 FA Cup defeat by Arsenal at Old Trafford on Monday night. Danny Welbeck returned to his old stomping ground to score the winner after Wayne Rooney levelled Nacho Monreal's strike in the first half, but it was yet another lacklustre display under Van Gaal that irked United supporters. United's legendary midfielder Roy Keane says Louis van Gaal should get more time in charge at Old Trafford . Van Gaal came under more criticism for another lacklustre display in the 2-1 FA Cup defeat by Arsenal . Keane was in the studio with former England stars Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Ian Wright . Their hero Keane, however, maintained the manager needs more time with fans unaware of what the job entails. 'Van Gaal is going to get criticised, you'd expect that,' Keane said during his BBC Match of the Day analysis. 'Give the man a chance - two or three years. A lot of fans don't quite understand how to run a football club as big as Manchester United. 'They should have given David Moyes more time but didn't. What are they going to do? Chop and change again? Van Gaal has been in the door two minutes. It takes time. It's literally a rebuilding job. A dismayed Marouane Fellaini (left), Michael Carrick (centre) and Wayne Rooney after Arsenal's winner . Danny Welbeck broke the hearts of his boyhood club by pouncing on an error to send Arsenal to Wembley . 'It would be a disaster if United don't finish in top four. The big problem with people at the club and ex-players is they keep looking back comparing teams from 10 years ago. 'They have got to look forward. Focus on the players, focus on the manager... get right behind him. I still think they have enough to get in that top four.' Keane's old sparring partner, former Newcastle and England striker Alan Shearer, was more damning. He said:\u00a0'Manchester United's main priority this season is finishing in the top four. If they don't then it will be a catastrophe. 'They have spent a lot of money on players. There's a hell of a lot more money that needs to be spent to get them anywhere near where they want to be. 'There isn't another team in the Premier League that passes it back more than Manchester United.' Wayne Rooney's flying header to equalise for United in the first half couldn't stop his side crashing out . Angel Di Maria's red card was the final blow for United as Van Gaal's troops lost their heads . Keane and Shearer's battle of words during the BBC's FA Cup analysis were nothing compared to what the hot-headed duo got up to in their playing days. Neither was a player the opposition wanted to get on the wrong side of, so no battle was more fierce than when the two clashed. Keane lashes out at Shearer when the two came to blows at St James's Park in 2001 . The former United captain named Shearer as a player he 'always had in the back of his mind' in his recent autobiography The Second Half alongside other famous foes like Patrick Vieira and Alf-Inge Haaland. Keane made it clear that although he regularly came across Alan Shearer while working as a TV pundit, there is little or no chance of them ever building bridges such is the mutual dislike of each other. Keane picked Shearer out as a player he always had in the back of his mind alongside Patrick Vieira . The most famous flashpoint came in 2001 at St James' Park. The two skippers came head to head and Keane was shown a red card for lashing out at the England man. It was the first time the former United maestro had appeared in the BBC studio after a long association with terrestrial rivals ITV. Keane has to be held back by David Beckham during the infamous row that saw the United man sent off .","highlights":"Keane: 'Fans don't quite understand how to run a club as big as United'\nVan Gaal oversaw another poor performance in the 2-1 defeat by Arsenal .\nDanny Welbeck came back to haunt United by netting the winner .\nUnited now have no chance of silverware after crashing out of the FA Cup .\nREAD: Van Gaal walks out of Man Utd press conference on a sour note .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Manchester United news ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Reading the headlines out of Madison, Wisconsin, it's hard not to think about Ferguson, Missouri. But law enforcement's response to the shooting of 19-year-old Tony Robinson will not unfold in the same chaotic, violent and distrusting way as the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, Madison's top police leaders vowed. \"I think it's very clear that Madison, Wisconsin, is not Ferguson, Missouri,\" said Jim Palmer, the executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association. The head of the state's largest law enforcement group told CNN Monday that the Madison police department, unlike the Ferguson department, has a strong relationship with the people it serves. Madison Police Chief Mike Koval has been out front and outspoken about Robinson's shooting since it happened late Friday night. The chief said he understands people are angry and want answers. \"We have to say we are sorry at the outset for it and then we have to show affirmative steps in moving forward to bring community back into the fold,\" he said. Here are some ways Madison law enforcement appears to be responding differently than what was seen in Ferguson: . Difference in what police chiefs did after shooting . Madison: Within hours of the shooting, Koval went to Robinson's mother's home. \"We need to start as any healing or any reconciliation should with an 'I'm sorry,' and I've done that privately, and I'm attempting to do that publicly and that's the only way we can sort of begin the healing or the rift that may take years if at all to mend,\" the police chief said. The mother didn't want to meet with him but the chief talked and prayed with the biracial teenager's grandparents in the driveway, he said. They told Koval to hold off on trying to talk to the mother because emotions were too intense. \"I couldn't even begin to get my hands around the enormity of the loss and the tragic consequences,\" Koval said. \"Nineteen years old is too young.\" He stressed that \"the effort has to be there,\" in reaching out to the family. \"We have to acknowledge it, we have to own it, we have to say we are sorry at the outset for it and then we have to show affirmative steps in moving forward to bring community back into the fold, as it were.\" Ferguson: A day after Brown, who was African-American, was killed, protesters took to the streets of the Missouri town. They were incensed that witnesses said Brown's hands were up and that the teen's body had remained in the street, in the sun, for four hours. A month went by before Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson apologized to Brown's family. \"I'm truly sorry for the loss of your son. I'm also sorry that it took so long to remove Michael from the street,\" he said, in a videotaped message. A day after Brown's killing a vigil for him devolved into violence. Police tried to keep the crowd under control but clashes erupted. One officer was seen holding the leash of a barking dog, and St. Louis Alderman Antonio French said some officers wielded shotguns. Four days after Brown was killed and more than a day after riots erupted in Ferguson, Jackson spoke at a community forum, saying, the situation \"has been a tragedy for the city and the country.\" Responding to criticism that he'd missed immediate opportunities to address tension in the town that turned into violence, he said, \"It breaks my heart [that] some think I'm part of the problem.\" The police chief promised the crowd he would be part of the solution. But issues with how the department interacted with protesters and media continued. \"Keep moving\" was a common refrain that police told protesters and law enforcement threatened to arrest anyone who stood along sidewalks, whether they were resting or a reporter taking notes. In some cases, officers told demonstrators they couldn't stand for more than five seconds; some protesters were yelled at for walking too slowly. Such a tactic was a violation of the Constitution, a federal judge later ruled. In his videotaped message, Jackson apologized for that, too. \"The right of the people to peacefully assemble is what the police are here to protect. If anyone who was peacefully exercising that right is upset and angry, I feel responsible and I'm sorry,\" the police chief said. Five ways the Ferguson police chief is in hot water . Difference in investigation procedures: . Madison: Under Wisconsin law, an outside agency is tasked with investigating police-involved shootings. In the case in Madison, that would be the Division of Criminal Investigation. Once DCI completes its work, findings will be delivered to the local district attorney, Chief Koval said. On Monday, Gov. Scott Walker issued a statement saying that another layer of investigation will come from the Wisconsin Department of Justice, which will conduct an independent investigation -- a requirement of all officer-involved deaths. Ferguson: Chief Jackson asked the St. Louis County Police Department to conduct an independent investigation into Brown's killing. It was only a few days that passed between the shooting and when Jon Belmar, the chief of St. Louis County Police Department, told media what led to Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson shooting Brown. \"The genesis of this was a physical confrontation,\" Belmar said. Brown \"physically assaulted\" the officer, Belmar said, and the teen tried to get the officer's weapon. Differences with timing of releasing the officer's name . Madison: Chief Koval released the name of the officer who shot Robinson within hours of the incident. He is 12-year department veteran Matt Kenny. The chief volunteered that the officer had shot and killed a man in 2007. Kenny was cleared on any wrongdoing in that incident, the chief said, because an investigation determined that the man was killed in a \"suicide by cop\" situation. During the incident involving Robinson, Kenny suffered a blow to the head, Koval said. He has been placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. Ferguson: Three days after Brown was killed, Ferguson police backtracked on a promise made a day earlier to release the name of the officer. The reason the department gave? Threats made to another officer who was falsely accused on social media of shooting Brown, Jackson said. The chief said he thought the threats were \"credible\" and that \"the safety factor far outweighs the benefit from releasing the name, which is minimal.\" Lawyers representing Brown's family blasted the decision, and accused the police of protecting their own and ignoring standard procedures. Difference in how authorities described victim's past . Madison: Wisconsin Circuit Court documents indicate Robinson pleaded guilty in December to an armed robbery that occurred last April. But when Koval was pressed for more details, he refused to talk about the teen's record or any run-ins with law enforcement. \"I could but I choose not to,\" the chief said. \"I frankly think it is, for our purposes today, wholly inappropriate and I am not going to blemish anyone's character, particularly someone's as young as his.\" Ferguson: Six days after Brown's shooting -- on the same day police released Officer Wilson's name -- police released surveillance video of a convenience store robbery in which Brown was allegedly involved before he died. The decision to release that video frustrated many, including others in law enforcement. Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson stated the robbery and shooting of Brown \"are separate issues.\" \"I told (Chief Jackson) I think both of those being released today was not needed and was not the way that we needed to go,\" Johnson told CNN. \"Today is about taking care of this incident here, getting to those facts that are there, and Michael Brown and his family.\" Differences in mayor's reaction immediately after shooting . Madison: Less than a day after the shooting, Mayor Paul Soglin vowed that \"there will be answers,\" the Wisconsin State Journal reported.  \"We all deserve to know the facts in this case,\" he said. \"Tony Robinson's family deserves that, our community deserves that, and the Madison Police deserve that. When the answers come, we will be open and transparent in communicating them.\" The promise to be transparent in sharing results of an investigation were repeated on the city's web site. Ferguson: Ferguson Mayor James Knowles urged the community to stay calm and not escalate the situation. \"We don't know what happened and there are lots of conflicting stories,\" Knowles said. \"Unfortunately there will have to be some time taken to understand what happened. Hopefully we will get to an understanding and justice will be served.\" Speaking a day after a vigil for Brown devolved into a riot, Knowles said on CNN that \"the events of last night are not indicative of who we are,\" and that the chaos was \"not constructive\" and only \"bringing down the community.\" Difference in size and tone of rallies and tone . Madison: On Friday night, dozens of demonstrators gathered in Madison. \"Who do we trust?\" some called out, prompting the response, \"No one!\" And in another refrain, they chanted, \"Black lives matter,\" a phrase that Ferguson protesters coined. Online the #WillyStreet hashtag, referencing to Williamson Street, where the shooting happened, trended. \"Praying for Madison tonight,\" wrote one activist. \"Stand up, sit in, walk out - until u get answers. And until there are no more hashtag eulogies.\" The demonstrations, which have been constant, have remained peaceful. Watch protesters outraged over police killing . Ferguson: Just hours after Brown was killed, a vigil for him turned violent as people hurled bottles at officers and kicked police cars parked on the streets. The often-violent demonstrations continued off and on for weeks, and protests around the country were held in solidarity. While many protesters were peaceful, in late November buildings were set on fire and destruction spread after a grand jury said it had decided not to indict Officer Wilson. Fire, chaos erupt in Ferguson after grand jury doesn't indict . CNN's Elise Miller, Eliott C. McLaughlin, Faith Karami, Kristina Sgueglia, Rosa Flores, Ralph Ellis, Joe Sutton and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","highlights":"Police officials in Madison say their responses to shooting by officer reflect their role in community .\nOne example: Madison chief talked to teen's family soon after shooting .\nA month went by before Ferguson chief apologized to Brown's family ."}
{"article":"Lausanne, Switzerland (CNN)Talks to reach a deal on a framework agreement on Iran's nuclear program will be extended an extra day, U.S. officials said Tuesday. \"\u200eWe've made enough progress in the last days to merit staying until Wednesday. There are several difficult issues still remaining,\"\u200e State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the talks in Lausanne would continue another day as \"long as the conversations continue to be productive.\" Diplomats and negotiators worked late as an initial deadline approached, but more time appeared necessary to reach a framework deal. How long talks will continue was unclear. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius informed the Iranians that he will return to Paris at dawn Wednesday in an apparent effort to force the Iranians' hand, Western diplomatic sources told CNN. Hamid Ba'idinejad from Iran's Foreign Ministry said earlier Tuesday there are no \"artificial\" deadlines and a deal will be reached, when each issue has been resolved. Diplomats told CNN that there has been progress, but gaps remain. For Iran, that means there's a light at the end of the tunnel for crippling sanctions. For the West, it means real hope that it's possible to loosen up on Tehran while still being confident that it won't develop nuclear weapons. The international sanctions relief issue has been resolved, according to Ba'idinejad. \"We have had long discussions on this, but there are issues that are related to sanctions that are still under consideration,\"  Ba'idinejad said. He added that is not the only issue that needs to be worked out. The thing is, nuclear physics is complicated. So are the international dynamics anytime you're talking about Iran and the West, with mutual distrust and contempt a shared sentiment for years. That's why it's taken so long to even get to this point, and why what's happening in Lausanne matters. Before you can iron out nitty-gritty technical details in a permanent, comprehensive pact  -- which carries the more important deadline of June 30 -- you have to agree on what you're going to talk about. What happens if Wednesday passes and there's no framework agreement? In the short term, it appears, not much. Iran's power rises, with or without deal . The real deadline isn't for three months, after all. As for the March 31 date, there's nothing to stop the parties from continuing to talk -- though an Iranian official told state-run Press TV that no one had raised the idea of an extension as of late Monday. \"All emphasize that the chance should not be missed, and they are all doing their best,\" Ba'idinejad said. So far, there's been a lot of meetings, with occasional smiles for cameras followed by foreign ministers talking behind closed doors. After working through the previous night, representatives from the key players -- most of them foreign ministers -- met all day Tuesday to try to resolve differences in what Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi described as \"the final stage\" of \"these marathon-like negotiations.\" The parties are either on the verge of a milestone agreement or still separated on some crucial points, depending on who you listen to. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is among the optimists. Russia has been closer than most to Iran even as it's gone along with sanctions. \"Prospects for this round of talks are not bad, I would even say good,\" Lavrov said before heading to Switzerland for the final round of negotiations, according to state-run Sputnik news agency. \"The chances are high.\" But in comments Monday to CNN, a more cautious Kerry conceded there was \"a little more light there today, but there are still some tricky issues.\" \"There still remain some difficult issues,\" the top U.S. diplomat said. \"We are working very hard to work those through ... with a view to get something done.\" 21 questions on Iranian nuclear talks . Iran has been under intense international pressure and has faced crippling sanctions over its nuclear program for years. The sides began moving away from stalemate with Iranians' 2013 election of President Hassan Rouhani, who has insisted that Iran wants a peaceful nuclear energy program but not weapons. Viewed as a moderate -- especially compared with other powerful figures in Iran, including the country's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei -- Rouhani campaigned on a platform that he'd work to help Iran's economy by reducing its rifts with the outside world. His government has had some success easing those tensions, spearheading interim agreements that have loosened some sanctions. But a comprehensive and final deal has remained elusive. There's been discussion on what to do with Iran's existing fissile material -- which is important because, as long as it's still around, that will make it easier to produce a nuclear weapon more quickly. Still, U.S. officials suggested Monday the debate over this has been overblown, with Harf calling it one outstanding issue though \"it hasn't, quite honestly, been one of the toughest ones.\" More important are three points that have dominated the talks in Lausanne: . \u2022 How quickly or slowly Iran will be allowed to advance its nuclear technology in the last five years of the 15-year agreement. \u2022 How quickly the crushing U.N. sanctions will go away. \u2022 Whether sanctions will snap back into place if Iran violates the deal. Iran wants them gone for good. Lavrov claims that the U.N. Security Council will lift the sanctions right away, but other international negotiators want to merely suspend them, so they can be reapplied as leverage if Iran does not keep its end of the bargain. Agreement on those points is crucial, a Western diplomat said. \"There cannot be an agreement if we do not have answers to these questions,\" the diplomat said. Another point of contention: what to do with the nuclear substances Iran already has. Diplomats had told journalists about a plan for Iran to ship its fissile material to Russia. The idea is that if Tehran doesn't have a nuclear stockpile at its fingertips, it will have a longer \"breakout time\" to make a nuclear weapon should negotiations fall apart. Iran isn't ready to do that, one of its negotiators said Sunday. \"The export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our program,\" Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said, \"and we do not intend to send them abroad.\" But on Monday, U.S. officials said the rumblings in the media about the stockpile issue were overblown. Negotiators had not yet decided any specifics about the disposal of fissile material, and Iran has made the comments many times before, a senior State Department official said, citing a list of previous examples of such statements in press reports. With or without a deal, a lot can change in the next three months. For one, the devil is in the details -- any one of which could throw everyone back to square one. Then there's the possibility that a deal ironed out in Switzerland is rejected by any of the key players. That's been raised as a possibility in the United States, even though a Washington Post-ABC News Poll conducted in the past few days found that 59% of respondents support a deal in Iran that would restrict its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Earlier this month, 47 Republican senators wrote directly to the Iranian government, reminding it that any deal it reaches with U.S. President Barack Obama might be moot once his term ends in less than two years. One person leading the charge against a possible deal, even though he'll have no direct part in shaping it, is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Reiterating points he made earlier this month to the U.S. Congress, Netanyahu said Tuesday \"the greatest threat to our security and safety and our future is Iranians' attempt to become nuclear.\" \"And the agreement that is being formed in Lausanne,\" the Israeli leader said, \"is paving the road to that result.\" CNN's Elise Labott reported from Lausanne, and Steve Almasy and Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta. Jethro Mullen wrote and reported from Hong Kong. CNN's Ben Brumfield, Jim Sciutto, Nimet Kirac and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","highlights":"Sources tell CNN that French foreign minister has told Iranians he is leaving early Wednesday morning .\nNetanyahu: \"Agreement ... in Lausanne is paving\" way for Iran nuclear weapons .\nIran, world powers talking to set up parameters for framework deal on Iran's nuclear program ."}
{"article":"(CNN)America used to be a place where we said, \"Give me liberty or give me death.\" We live by a credo that \"freedom isn't free,\" and that our Constitution is worth dying for. How inspirational it is to believe that this is the wind of thought that blows underneath the Eagle's wings. Unfortunately, whenever that wind becomes just a little too gusty for comfort, we find out just how little relationship our poetic credo has to our collective guts. The latest example:  Nine seconds of video of a number of boys singing an offensive song. Immediately, the University of Oklahoma expelled two of the boys for their speech. Forget whether you like the speech or not. That is not relevant. These boys got kicked out of a public school for singing a song, on their own time, in a privately rented bus, simply because the government didn't like the content of their song. Opinion: What's the right way to face racism? Censors overstepping their bounds is no surprise. What surprises me is how readily the public supported the expulsions, and how many supposedly intelligent people were willing to turn the First Amendment on its head, because of nine seconds of video. I don't like the song or its message either. I can't imagine anyone reasonable who would. But I want to live in a country where the government does not listen to my songs and then decide whether or not I should be punished, based on what words I used. That is not freedom. I understand that most of us hate racism. We are on a mission to eradicate it from all corners. But I am not willing to trade the First Amendment for a society where we don't need to hear racist words. In Abrams v. United States, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote a passage that ultimately became the cornerstone of a liberty-based view toward free speech, and which became the dominant theory in First Amendment jurisprudence. In Abrams, Holmes gave us \"the marketplace of ideas.\" And what a brilliant theory it was. Holmes noted that if someone was completely confident in the belief that they were right, then it would seem logical that they would want to suppress dissenting views. \"If you have no doubt of your premises or your power, and want a certain result with all your heart, you naturally express your wishes in law, and sweep away all opposition.\" Those who wish to eradicate racism are certain that they are right. I believe in a racism-free world.  I have marched in counterprotests against the Ku Klux Klan. I've stood up in places you don't want to be, against violent neo-Nazis. And I would do it again. But I feel no kinship with anyone who would harm the First Amendment to fight racism. Some things are worse than racism -- like a loss of the right to speak your mind and think your own thoughts. Unfortunately, that is a price that too many of us are willing to pay. I am not. As certain as I am that my views on race are correct, I cannot shake Holmes' wisdom from my mind. He wrote: . \"But when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas -- that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out. That, at any rate, is the theory of our Constitution.\" For that reason, I would gladly protest against the KKK, but I would never abide any government official denying the KKK its right to speak. I understand those who would wish to do so. They want to eradicate racism, and the end will justify the means. However, we have slowly been descending into a place where we are trading this for freedoms that are far more precious than the freedom to avoid having our feelings hurt by offensive statements. Of course, some say that these were more than \"offensive.\" The song was a \"threat.\" After all, it did mention lynching black people. But was that really a threat?  An idiotic ditty in an all-white bus? To call it a threat is disingenuous. What about the disruptive nature of the song? Should other students have to go to school with people who clearly despise them, and who carry these offensive racist thoughts? Yes. They should be free to have these thoughts, they should be free to say these things. If it crosses the line into action, or even imminent incitement to action, that's another story. In this case, that never happened. The First Amendment prevails here. Opinion: The danger society doesn't talk about . It is easy to claim that these Sigma Alpha Epsilon boys did not deserve First Amendment protection. Many have said so. But, when you hear that, your immediate reaction should be one of skepticism. The First Amendment is not there to serve as a comforting blanket of civility. In fact, it is there precisely to protect the sharp edges. It is there for the KKK, the Nazis, SAE, and you alike. It is there for words that shock us, challenge us, and that bother us. You should want to protect the SAE boys -- not that they deserve it. You should do so because the day will come that your speech is unpopular. Once, speech in favor of racial equality was considered to be \"bad speech.\" Once, professors were kicked off campus for not being \"anti-gay enough.\" But, today, the thought of equality and tolerance have won out in the marketplace. Let that victory stand, without trying to cement it with the force of law, and without destroying the very liberty that allowed these \"good thoughts\" to flourish in the first place.","highlights":"University of Oklahoma students were expelled after video surfaced of racist song .\nMarc Randazza: Those willing to weaken First Amendment should realize their free expression is also at risk ."}
{"article":"(CNN)The terror that came to Tunisia on Wednesday -- the deadliest attack on tourists in the Arab world since the 1997 massacre in Luxor, Egypt -- was a long time coming. Tunisia has been widely seen as the only success story of the Arab Spring with a new progressive constitution, a freely elected secular President and Prime Minister, and a moderate Islamist opposition so far committed to democratic principles. But economic progress has lagged well behind. High unemployment has created frustrations among the young and a significant number have looked for answers in radical Islam. Political opening in Tunisia has given radicals more breathing room, their numbers swollen by the release hardened Islamist militants during the 2011 Tunisian revolution that swept away decades of autocratic rule. One of those who was freed from jail was Seifallah ben Hassine -- also known as Abu Iyyad -- a veteran Tunisian Jihadi who worked with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan in the 1990s and founded the Tunisian Combatant group. Soon after he was released he founded Ansar al Shariah in Tunisia, a pro-Jihadi movement which has up to 40,000 followers. The group has a similar outlook to its namesake in Libya which the United States says carried out the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi on September 11, 2012, and according to Geoff Porter, a terrorism expert at North Africa Risk Consulting, there are real and fluid links between the two groups. Three days after the Beghazi attack, Ansar al Shariah in Tunisia organized a mob attack outside the U.S. Embassy in Tunisia which put American lives at risk. According to the U.S. government, the group has also been responsible for several other attacks, including attempted suicide bombings at Tunisian tourist destinations. In October 2013, a Tunisian suicide bomber blew himself up outside a beach hotel in Sousse, killing only himself. Another was arrested in Monastir before he could blow up his device. The two had reportedly tried to travel to Syria but had been persuaded enroute by Jihadis in Libya to bring Jihad home. In 2013 two secular Tunisian politicians were assassinated by Islamist extremists.  The United States said Ansar al Shariah was implicated in the attacks. In the last two years, Tunisian security forces have increasingly cracked down on Ansar al Shariah, but the movement still has a significant following. Ben Hassine fled to Libya where he is now believed to be based. The Syrian Jihad has been the single biggest factor in the worsening security situation in Tunisia. Over 3000 Tunisians have flocked to fight Jihad in Syria and Iraq, many of them joining ISIS. And about 500 are believed to have returned stretching the resources of security services. In December 2014 ISIS released a video calling on Tunisians to pledge allegiance to ISIS and carry out attacks, including assassinations. The Tunis museum attack took place just days after a Tunisian Jihadi tweeted that a pledge of allegiance by Tunisian Jihadis to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was coming soon, according to the SITE intelligence group. The Tunisian Jihadi who posted the message Sunday claimed to belong to \"Jund al-Khilafah in Tunisia.\" In December, a grouping by the same name had pledged allegiance to ISIS. But the earlier pledge appears not to have fully registered with ISIS.  An ISIS fighter in Raqqah, recently appeared in a video questioning why Jihadis in Tunisia had not pledged fealty. The Tunisian Jihadi replied \"Wait for the glad tidings of what will bring you joy. ... The delay of the public pledge of allegiance was for the sake of preparation.\" The statement raises the possibility that the museum attack could be ISIS's debut on the Tunisian stage, timed to precede a pledge of allegiance from Tunisian Jihadis for maximum impact. While pro-ISIS twitter accounts lit up in celebration after the museum attack, there had been no credible claims of responsibility as of late Wednesday. Tunisian security officials are worried about spillover from an increasingly chaotic Libya.  ISIS has taken advantage of a simmering civil war in Tunisia's neighbor to rapidly expand. It is now the dominant force in Derna in eastern Libya and controls parts of the town center of Sirte, the hometown of former Libya strongman Moammar Gadhafi. And it has built an increasingly significant presence in Tripoli itself, carrying out a gun attack on the Corinthia Hotel in January. A number of Tunisians are also believed to be training with ISIS in a half dozen training camps the group operates in the Green Mountains between Benghazi and Derna in eastern Libya. In late 2012 al Qaeda's North African affiliate AQIM set up a branch in Tunisia called the Uqba ibn Nafi Brigade, a 60-strong Jihadi outfit composed of Tunisians, Algerians, and some Libyans. The group is believed to include fighters driven out of Mali by French forces. The Uqba ibn Nafi Brigade has been responsible for a string of attacks on Tunisian security services in mountainous Djebel Chaambi region along the Algerian border. \"They have been the most active terrorist organization in Tunisia to date,\" Porter told CNN. \"It is rumored, but not confirmed, that they are getting additional personnel from Algeria because members of AQIM in Algeria have been fleeing intensified Algerian military operations.\" Andrew Lebovich, a North Africa security analyst based in New York told CNN that the Uqba ibn Nafi Brigade issued a statement late last year threatening to attack Tunis. \"Most of their attacks have been in the Djebel Chaambi region but it's possible they have extended their operations closer to the capital,\" he said. The museum attack is the biggest crisis faced by Tunisia since the revolution. It is likely to significantly impact Tunisia's tourism industry, worsening the economic outlook and increasing the sense of frustration on which extremists thrive. There is also concern Tunisian security forces, traumatized by the attack on the capital, could once again embrace repression in their struggle to contain the Jihadi threat. \"The Parliament was debating tougher anti-terrorism laws when the museum attack took place. The worry now is that Tunisia's security services will crack down hard on Islamists increasing tensions and making the problem far worse,\" Lebovich told CNN.","highlights":"Tunisia was widely seen as only success story of Arab Spring .\nEconomic progress has lagged behind democratic principles .\nTerror has been percolating in the region for a while, stoked by regional unrest ."}

{"article":"The return of midfielder Koke could be crucial to Atletico Madrid's hopes of overturning a 1-0 deficit to Bayer Leverkusen in Tuesday's Champions League last 16, second leg, coach Diego Simeone said on Monday. A Spain international and one of Atletico's most creative influences, Koke missed last month's first leg defeat in Germany due to injury but has featured in Atletico's last three outings in La Liga. The 23-year-old, who scored in this month's 1-1 draw at home to Valencia, is also a dead ball specialist and the Spanish champions have netted a host of goals from his corners and free kicks. Atletico Madrid head coach Diego Simeone and Mario Suarez attend a press conference on the eve of the tie . Simeone believes Koke returning will be a boost for his team as they try to overturn a first-leg deficit . 'He is one of those all-round midfielders who is gifted at reading the game, he knows how to play in different positions in the centre and he has very good peripheral vision,' Simeone told a news conference. 'When he is on top form, he allows us to play with speed. Not because he is fast himself but because his vision allows us to play that way.' Atletico, last season's beaten finalists, have been struggling for goals in recent weeks and have only scored once in their last four outings in all competitions.

'We need to shake off their pressuring quickly when they are trying to win back the ball,' Simeone said. 'They know very well how to disrupt play and hold you up,' added the former Argentina captain.

{"article":"Atlanta (CNN)A report on lab safety at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put together by a committee of external experts calls the agency's commitment to safety \"inconsistent and insufficient.\" The report, which was completed in January but posted on the agency's website this week, also says \"laboratory safety training is inadequate.\" The report was put together by an external group of 11 experts in biosafety, laboratory science and research. In the report, they say they are \"very concerned that the CDC is on the way to losing credibility.\" The agency created the advisory group to improve lab safety in July in the wake of two mishaps and other issues that were uncovered through procedural reviews. One incident occurred in June when dozens of employees in a bioterrorism lab working with the deadly anthrax virus, were at risk because of a failure to properly follow sterilization techniques. The head of that lab resigned after the incident. This followed a May incident in which avian influenza samples, thought to not be dangerous, were unintentionally mixed with the deadly H5N1 influenza virus and then shipped to a USDA lab. Then in December, with the advisory group already working to reduce lab safety risks and improve the culture of safety, employees in the Ebola lab were potentially exposed to that virus when a technician mistakenly transported the wrong specimens from a high-level lab to a lower-level lab. Internal investigations were done after each incident, and various changes were recommended such as cameras being added to some labs and certificates being required to transfer samples from some labs, following the Ebola incident. The four-page report summarizes the groups findings and offers recommendations following visits to CDC labs, meetings with CDC staff and a survey about the laboratory safety culture at CDC. The report recommends all CDC labs go through an external review and accreditation process. They suggest the College of American Pathologists for clinical labs and the American Biological Safety Association for research labs.  To that point, the committee says in the report, \"The CDC must not see itself as special. The internal controls and rules that the rest of the world works under also apply to CDC.\" Other recommendations include: . -- Funding for lab safety programs and standardized training. -- Implementing risk assessments. -- Establishing a system of responsible science and accountability. -- Rewarding researchers who run safe labs. -- Hiring a director to oversee lab safety. In response to the recommendations, CDC Chief Operating Officer Sherri Berger said in a statement, \"It's critical that we continue to solicit feedback on how we can improve our operations, especially functions as critical as lab safety. We brought this group of external experts together over the summer to assist us with identifying and implementing solutions, of which many are already underway.\"","highlights":"External advisory committee to CDC warns the agency is on its way to losing credibility .\nGroup of experts says CDC's commitment to safety is \"inconsistent\" and \"insufficient \"\nAdvisory committee recommends all CDC labs go through external review and accreditation process ."}
{"article":"Kano, Nigeria (CNN)Hundreds of troops from Chad and Niger launched a ground and aerial offensive against Boko Haram in northeastern Nigeria on Sunday, according to residents and military sources from Niger. The sweeping offensive is taking place along the Niger-Nigeria border, sources said, effectively opening a new front in the fight against the Islamist terror group. This comes a day after Boko Haram pledged allegiance to ISIS in an audio message purported to be from leader Abubakar Shekau. Latest developments in the fight against ISIS . \"Early this morning, troops from Niger and Chad launched ground and air raids against Boko Haram into Nigeria, and the operation is still continuing,\" said a military official in the border town of Diffa, Niger. \"It is an intensive operation that is aimed at pulverizing Boko Haram and crippling their capability,\" according to the source.  He spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to comment publicly about the operation. \u200eResidents said artillery fire and fighter jets pushed Boko Haram fighters into the Damasak district of Nigeria, which is a Boko Haram enclave. \"Around 6 a.m., soldiers from Niger and Chad in huge numbers confronted Boko Haram around the Doutchi area outside Diffa and later crossed the bridge into Nigeria,\" said Diffa resident Ari Boubakarna. \"We heard huge explosions from artillery fire and fighter jets, but the explosions receded \u200eas the troops moved further into Nigeria,\" Boubakarna continued. A journalist working in Diffa saw \u200etroops headed toward the border with Nigeria, where Boko Haram fighters had taken up positions. \u200e\"They left in a huge convoy of over 200 vehicles, some of them fitted with machine guns, including armored tanks, ambulances, water tankers and cargo trucks, which indicate they were going for a prolonged operation,\" the journalist said. \u200eResidents lined up the streets to offer water and tea as the troops drove out of Diffa, residents said, adding that soldiers promised to capture Shekau alive.\u200e . \u200eAnother contingent of troops, backed by air support, moved out from the town of Bosso, Niger, according to residents. \"Soldiers in large numbers crossed into Nigeria this morning, and we could hear thunderous sounds of gunfire and explosions coming from the direction of Malam Fatori,\" Bosso resident Tandja Moumouni said. Nigeria and its neighbors have recently mounted a coordinated offensive against Boko Haram militants in the Borno state, where the Islamist group has seized a large swathe of territory.  Nigeria shares a border with Niger, Chad and Cameroon there. As a part of this alliance, thousands of troops from Niger and Chad were stationed in Bosso and Diffa in January. \u200eThe offensive has succeeded in reclaiming some of the territory seized by the group. Nigeria has vowed to liberate all of its territories from Boko Haram before the general elections, which begin on March 28, to enable displaced residents return to their homes for the elections.","highlights":"Troops from Chad and Niger launch offensive against Boko Haram .\nThe offensive is part of a coordinated regional campaign ."}
{"article":"(CNN)Two million illnesses. 23,000 deaths. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that's the human toll from antibiotic-resistant \"superbugs\" each year in the United States. To fight the growing problem of infections that can't be treated, the administration of President Barack Obama is implementing a five-year national action plan at a cost of $1.2 billion. Those funds, part of the President's 2015 budget, which must still be approved by Congress, would nearly double the amount of federal money allocated to the fight. The plan calls for creating a \"one-health\" approach to testing and reporting superbugs around the country, as well as establishing a DNA database of resistant bacteria. New, rapid tests to detect emerging resistant bacteria will be developed. Research for new antibiotics and vaccines will accelerate. The plan calls for two new options for people, and three for animals, by 2020. Global surveillance and cooperation is also stressed, including a global database for animals. A key goal is to slow the growth and spread of superbugs by reducing the use of antibiotics when they aren't needed. The plan calls for a 50% reduction in inappropriate antibiotic use in doctor's offices and a 20% reduction in hospital use by 2020. \"This is a lofty goal,\" said internist and Emory Associate Professor Dr. Sandra Fryhofer. \"It's important for both patients and professionals to be on board.\" There are still details to work out. \"Who determines what's appropriate?\" asked Atlanta pediatrician Dr. Jennifer Shu. \"Are we going to have a checklist of requirements that have to be met? I think it might be a bit tough to measure, but I think improvement can definitely happen.\" A recent survey of 796 health care professionals found 63% of the sample prescribed antibiotics when they weren't absolutely necessary, at least 10% of the time. A top reason: the patient requested it. \"Some patients put a lot of pressure on doctors to give them an antibiotic, and they may think they're not getting good care if they're not given one. But that's just not true,\" said Fryhofer. \"It's become like an insurance policy but it's an insurance policy that doesn't give good dividends.\" \"I do find there is a lot of education that has to go on with patients that might expect antibiotics when their child is sick,\" said Shu, \"but I think in recent years I have seen more of an awareness, and many of my patients are more hesitant to ask.\" Another part of the plan pledges to eliminate the widespread use of antibiotics to boost the growth of animals raised for food. It will also phase in oversight by veterinarians for other uses of antibiotics in feed and water. While applauding the spirit of the pledge, critics say the limits are still too voluntary and limited in scope. \"The problem we have with the plan is that it only removes the growth claims from the label,\" said senior analyst Steve Roach at Keep Antibiotics Working. \"What we hoped for in the plan was a commitment from FDA to identify which antibiotic uses other than growth promotion need to be changed.\" \"With 80% of the antibiotics produced in the United States being used in agriculture mostly for prevention,\" said Louise Slaughter, D-New York, who has an alternate proposal in front of Congress, \"any meaningful solution to the looming antibiotic resistance crisis must begin with limits on the farm. Trusting a voluntary policy that lets industry police itself will not bring about real change.\"","highlights":"Antibiotic resistance is a pressing public health issue, CDC says .\nPlan would nearly double the amount of federal monies allocated to the fight .\nPatient use of unnecessary antibiotics will be curtailed ."}
{"article":"London (CNN)Captive Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko has sent a stark message to Russian President Vladimir Putin as she awaits trial in a Moscow jail. In a letter from prison, written in response to questions from CNN, she said: \"If Putin wants to defeat Ukraine -- let's try to defeat me first!\" \"But if he wants peace and friendship between our nations as he claims,\" she added, \"I am ready to make the first step towards it. \"My freedom will be that first step towards peace and understanding in Ukraine.\" Savchenko has been held by the Russian authorities in pre-trial detention since last June. Her defiant message was written after CNN submitted a series of questions to the Ukrainian fighter pilot through one of her lawyers, Mark Feygin. We do not know under what circumstances Savchenko answered the questions, but Feygin says she wrote the responses on Friday as he was visiting her. Savchenko undertook a hunger strike for 83 days to protest her detention despite pleas from her family and her lawyers. She recently abandoned her fast after nearing death but has since resumed it, only drinking broth and milk occasionally to stay alive. Russia claims the 33-year-old is behind the killings of two Russian journalists hit by mortar fire at a checkpoint in eastern Ukraine, allegations she has always denied. Moscow says she then crossed voluntarily into Russia and sought asylum as a refugee. The Ukrainian government, however, insists she was kidnapped by rebel forces and that she is a prisoner of war. \"I have already been in captivity for an hour when those Russian journalists died. I have not seen them, and our ways have never crossed.. The 'rebels' themselves told me that those journalists came under fire of their own 'makhnovtsi' [slang for 'anarchists'],\" Savchenko told CNN in her letter from jail. \"And the investigators knew all about it since the very beginning! And they have nothing on me! They simply thought that it would be easy to \"twist my arms\" and receive another star for their epaulettes. But it's not going to happen!\" she added. Savchenko's case has attracted wide international attention and turned her into a symbol of resistance against Russia in her home country, with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko awarding her the title \"Hero of Ukraine,\" one of the nation's highest honors. She has also been voted into the Ukrainian parliament despite her captivity. Despite her critical situation, Savchenko appears to have retained her sense of humor just as much as her determination, writing that she was feeling \"On the edge!...;) Close to Nirvana and enlightenment!;) Joking.\" \"Holding on! But holding my body entirely on my the power of my will,\" she continued, \"because I am so numb that I couldn't feel the needle when the blood sample was taken from my vein today. \"Tottering, head is spinning, [blood] pressure 80x40, [blood] sugar 2.9, T [temperature] -- 35.7\u00b0C. But still be standing till 50kg [body weight]! Even longer if God let's me! Hasn't fainted even once and hasn't fallen off my feet.\" The military pilot told CNN she is being monitored \"24 hours a day,\" which she finds \"very annoying.\" \"Protection and security measures are such that King Kong would not have been able to break away!;),\" she joked again. \"But in general all is very decent and polite! Treatment is reasonable.\" Savchenko's lawyer recently told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an interview that President Putin holds Savchenko's fate and that she wanted to await trial out of jail. Several international dignitaries have urged Moscow to release her, including EU Foreign Policy Chief Federica Mogherini and the U.S. State Department, to no avail. But as Savchenko continues her hunger strike, is she willing to ultimately die in detention? \"To die?! That's not our methods!!!;) I'll think of something better!...:;),\" she said. \"I'll be on hunger strike as I said until I am returned back to Ukraine, or at least [until] detention is changed to a house arrest at the Ukrainian Consulate in RF, which is actually a part of Ukraine in Russia. \"There is no point starting eating in prison. The bite doesn't go down the throat here in this cage! And the truth must win after all!!!\" CNN reached out to Russian authorities for an update on Savchenko's case, who referred us to their last statement on Savchenko, dated from 20 February, where they call on the media to \"Let the investigators to finish their job. Let the court of justice to determine Savchenko's degree of guilt of and punishment for the crimes she is charged with.\" Savchenko is currently scheduled to appear in court on May 13.","highlights":"Captive Ukrainian pilot sends message to Putin as she awaits trial in a Moscow jail .\nNadiya Savchenko went on hunger strike for 83 days .\nFighter pilot has been in pre-trial detention since last June ."}
{"article":"(CNN)At first glance Esther Okade seems like a normal 10-year-old. She loves dressing up as Elsa from \"Frozen,\" playing with Barbie dolls and going to the park or shopping. But what makes the British-Nigerian youngster stand out is the fact that she's also a university undergraduate. Esther, from Walsall, an industrial town in the UK's West Midlands region, is one of the country's youngest college freshmen. The talented 10-year-old enrolled at the Open University, a UK-based distance learning college, in January and is already top of the class, having recently scored 100% in a recent exam. \"It's so interesting. It has the type of maths I love. It's real maths -- theories, complex numbers, all that type of stuff,\" she giggles. \"It was super easy. My mum taught me in a nice way.\" She adds: \"I want to (finish the course) in two years. Then I'm going to do my PhD in financial maths when I'm 13. I want to have my own bank by the time I'm 15 because I like numbers and I like people and banking is a great way to help people.\" And in case people think her parents have pushed her into starting university early, Esther emphatically disagrees. \"I actually wanted to start when I was seven. But my mum was like, \"you're too young, calm down.\" After three years of begging, mother Efe finally agreed to explore the idea. A marvelous mathematical mind . Esther has always jumped ahead of her peers. She sat her first Math GSCE exam, a British high school qualification, at Ounsdale High School in Wolverhampton at just six, where she received a C-grade. A year later, she outdid herself and got the A-grade she wanted. Then last year she scored a B-grade when she sat the Math A-level exam. Esther's mother noticed her daughter's flair for figures shortly after she began homeschooling her at the age of three. Initially, Esther's parents had enrolled her in a private school but after a few short weeks, the pair began noticing changes in the usually-vibrant youngster. Efe says: \"One day we were coming back home and she burst out in tears and she said 'I don't ever want to go back to that school -- they don't even let me talk!' \"In the UK, you don't have to start school until you are five. Education is not compulsory until that age so I thought OK, we'll be doing little things at home until then. Maybe by the time she's five she will change her mind.\" Efe started by teaching basic number skills but Esther was miles ahead. By four, her natural aptitude for maths had seen the eager student move on to algebra and quadratic equations. And Esther isn't the only maths prodigy in the family. Her younger brother Isaiah, 6, will soon be sitting his first A-level exam in June. A philanthropic family . Not content with breaking barriers to attend college at just 10 years old, Esther is also writing a series of math workbooks for children called \"Yummy Yummy Algebra.\" \"It starts at a beginner level -- that's volume one. But then there will be volume two, and volume three, and then volume four. But I've only written the first one. \"As long as you can add or subtract, you'll be able to do it. I want to show other children they are special,\" she says. Meanwhile, Esther's parents are also trying to trail blaze their own educational journey back in Nigeria. The couple have set up a foundation and are in the process of building a nursery and primary school in Nigeria's Delta region (where the family are from). Named \"Shakespeare's Academy,\" they hope to open the school's doors in September. The proposed curriculum will have all the usual subjects such as English, languages, math and science, as well as more unconventional additions including morality and ethics, public speaking, entrepreneurship and etiquette. The couple say they want to emulate the teaching methods that worked for their children rather than focus on one way of learning. \"Some children learn very well with kinesthetics where they learn with their hands -- when they draw they remember things. Some children have extremely creative imaginations. Instead of trying to make children learn one way, you teach them based on their learning style,\" explains Efe. The educational facility will have a capacity of 2,000 to 2,500 students with up to 30% of students being local children offered scholarships to attend. Efe says: \"On one hand, billions of dollars worth of crude oil is pumped out from that region on a monthly basis and yet the poverty rate of the indigenous community is astronomical.\" While Paul adds: \"(The region has) poor quality of nursery and primary education. So by the time the children get secondary education they haven't got a clue. They haven't developed their core skills. \"The school is designed to give children an aim so they can study for something, not just for the sake of acquiring certifications. There is an end goal.\" Read this: 92-year-old student inspires a generation . Read this: Nigerian soul superstar Nneka is back!

{"article":"(CNN)Saudi Arabia is leading a military campaign against Shiite rebels in Yemen, bringing the wider region directly into a complex conflict that has festered for months. The Saudis say they want to restore the Yemeni government, a key U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda, which was kicked out of the capital by the rebels earlier this year. \"Having Yemen fail cannot be option for us or for our coalition partners,\" said Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, referring to the other nations in the region supporting the campaign. Here are answers to key questions about the escalating conflict in Yemen. Analysts say it can be summed up in one word: Iran. The Saudis \"perceive this as a threat from the Iranians,\" said CNN military analyst Lt. Col. Rick Francona. \"They look at the Houthis as nothing more than a proxy Iranian force, just like we can look at Hezbollah as a proxy Iranian force in southern Lebanon.\" Analysts say that Shiite-majority Iran and Sunni-dominated Saudi Arabia are locked in a strategic contest for influence across the Middle East. Now, the epic chess match has spread into Yemen, Saudi Arabia's southern neighbor. \"What they do not want is an Iranian-run state on their southern border, because they already feel they've got enough problems on their northern border,\" said Francona, a retired U.S. Air Force intelligence officer. Iran, northeast of Saudi Arabia, is considered to exercise powerful influence within the regime of President Bashar al-Assad in war-torn Syria and within the Shiite-led Iraqi government. The Saudis and other Gulf nations appeared to make an implicit reference to Iran in a statement about the start of the military campaign, describing the Houthi militias as \"backed by regional powers\" that are aiming for \"hegemony\" in Yemen. The Iranian government, for its part, condemned the offensive, calling for an immediate halt to Saudi-led airstrikes, state media reported. The chaos in Yemen appeared to be careering toward a full-blown civil war. The Houthis, whose power base is in northern Yemen, started protests against the central government in the capital, Sanaa, last summer. But they stepped up their campaign in September, seizing multiple government buildings. Attempts to strike political deals between the two sides had no effect, and the Houthis pushed into other areas of the country. The crisis intensified in January, when the Houthis displayed their clout by storming the presidential palace and putting President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi under house arrest. Hadi escaped to the southern city of Aden in February and declared that he remained the legitimate president. Since then, Hadi's supporters have repeatedly clashed with the Houthis and their allies, prompting the United Nations to warn of an impending civil war. The Houthis also have support from forces loyal to Hadi's predecessor, former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who resigned in 2012 after months of Arab Spring-inspired protests. The deepening chaos has led many governments to pull embassy staff out of Sanaa. The United States recently withdrew its remaining special forces in Yemen, dealing a blow to counterterrorism efforts in the country. Rebel forces captured parts of Aden and a nearby airbase Wednesday. Early Thursday, the Saudi-led strikes began. The airstrikes appear to be only the start of the campaign. Saudi Arabia has also pledged 150,000 soldiers to the coalition that's intervening in Yemen, the Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya TV network reported Thursday, raising the possibility of a ground offensive. \"The airstrikes will be the kickoff of the campaign,\" Francona said \"They'll want to knock down the air defenses and create a corridor with which they can move their troops in there.\" It wasn't immediately clear if other nations in the coalition were offering any ground troops. A ground offensive isn't a decision that Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud would take lightly. \"Saudi Arabia, all these years, has avoided sending troops into Yemen. It's a quagmire for the Saudis,\" CNN intelligence and security analyst Bob Baer said in January. Beyond the military campaign, the Saudis and their allies say they want to find a political solution for the violence-plagued nation. The aim is to bring back Yemen's \"security and stability through establishing a political process,\" said a statement from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait. Al-Jubeir, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, said American forces are not involved in the airstrikes. But Francona said he thought the United States most likely assisted with information needed to pick out targets. \"The Saudis don't have the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capability to determine all of these targets,\" he said. \"They've had to have had some help, and I think it probably came from us.\" Arab and senior Obama administration officials tell CNN that an interagency U.S. coordination team is in Saudi Arabia. The sources said the Saudis have not specified what they want yet, but will probably ask for American air support, satellite imagery and other intelligence. \"We can help with logistics and intelligence and things like that, but there will be no military intervention by the U.S.,\" a senior administration official said. A Saudi adviser told CNN that 10 countries are involved in the coalition: Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Pakistan and Sudan. But it was unclear how many of those countries other than Saudi Arabia were taking an active military role. The Saudi adviser told CNN that the UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar had contributed fighter planes to the operations. It brings another disturbing angle to the conflict. Yemen is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, considered by U.S. officials to be the most dangerous branch of the terrorist network. The Sunni Muslim extremist group, also known as AQAP, has taken advantage of Yemen's weak government to plan and launch terrorist attacks against the West. Operating from its heartland in central Yemen, it considers both the Shiite Houthis and the pro-U.S. Yemeni government as its foes. Houthi forces have clashed with AQAP and its allies in central Yemen. And bomb attacks have repeatedly hit Shiite gatherings in the capital. There are also concerns about ISIS' growing influence in Yemen. The Sunni militant group that controls large areas of Iraq and Syria claimed responsibility for attacks on Shiite mosques in Sanaa that killed more than 130 people this month. AQAP and ISIS looked set to be \"the big winners\" from the deepening chaos in Yemen, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said Wednesday before news of the Saudi airstrikes emerged. But the big question now is whether the Saudi-led coalition will take any action against the Sunni terrorist groups. CNN's Nic Robertson contributed to this report.","highlights":"Saudi Arabia sees Houthi rebels in Yemen as a proxy for Iran, analysts say .\nThe Saudis act as Yemen teeters on the brink of civil war ."}
